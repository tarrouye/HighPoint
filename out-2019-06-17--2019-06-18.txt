Title: Report: German Competition Will Rebound In Tesla's Favor
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla Model 3.Tesla investors are reeling as the share price dives, basic questions are being asked about the company’s long-term survival, and investment supporters jump ship.Berenberg Bank of Hamburg, Germany though, a long-term believer in Tesla, is hanging on in there, saying worries about demand for Tesla vehicles are overblown. The investment bank said sales weakness was more about logistical problems, as it cranked up sales of the Model 3 in Europe. And the long-feared assault from German carmakers like Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Porsche, could actually be a plus for Tesla because the increased interest in electric cars whipped up by publicity will reveal its superior and cheaper technology, the bank said in a report.Meanwhile the Model 3 stormed to the top of the Western Europe battery electric car sales charts in the first quarter of 2019 from a standing start, outselling the second best Renault Zoe with almost twice as many sales. This was all the more remarkable because the Model 3 was only available for sale from February, and the price of the Tesla is probably more than twice and maybe occasionally even 3 times that of the little Zoe city car.According to data from Berlin-based automotive industry analyst Matthias Schmidt (www.schmidtmatthias.de), Tesla sold 19,482 Model 3s in the first quarter compared with the second placed Zoe’s 11,049 and the Nissan Leaf with 10,315. That included 14,652 Model 3s in March, but that slowed down to 3,721 in April, according to carsalesbase.com. Carsalesbase data shows in all of 2018 Tesla sales in Europe totalled 29,614 compared with its U.S. sales of 191,627. Investors in Tesla have long been nervous about the fate of the company when German carmakers like Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Porsche arrive late but well prepared in the electric car game. According to Berenberg Bank, this could benefit the upstart American company.Jaguar I-Pace. “Demand support could ironically come from legacy car makers (mainly the Germans but including Jaguar Land Rover) increased electric vehicle marketing activities, as consumers ultimately discover Tesla’s more competitive offering, on both technology and price,” Berenberg Bank analyst Alexander Haissl said.“Consumers will ultimately discover Tesla’s technological and price – better value for money – leadership, as the advantage of Tesla over competitors is too significant to be ignored and dismissed. It will also become apparent that EV launches from traditional (manufacturers) also come with problems and delays. Quality issues can occur in early stages. Good examples of these are the recent recalls from Audi (E-tron) and the Jaguar I-Pace in the U.S.,” Haissl said.The Tesla share price has been under pressure lately after first quarter deliveries fell over 30% to around 63,000 compared with the previous quarter. Tesla sales would have to accelerate hard if the company guidance of up to 400,000 vehicles could be delivered in 2019. Tesla finances are also causing concern with $900 million of cash burn in the first quarter. Tesla said it will start generating cash in the rest of this year.Tesla’s share price closed at $214.92 Friday. Over the last 12 months it has been as high as $387.46 and as low as $176.99, according to Reuters’ data.Long-time supporter, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, has turned against Tesla, who questioned whether there will be enough demand in a market which favors SUVs.Audi e-tron.“This year’s sharp deceleration in demand has led to a substantial curtailment of the company’s ability to self-fund through free cash flow generation, at the margin potentially impacting the firm’s access to capital,” Jonas said in a report last month.“Tesla is a large and highly vertically integrated company, capacitized to build between 500,000 and 1 million units annually. In our opinion, Tesla has grown too big relative to near-term demand, putting great strain on the fundamentals,” the report said.Berenberg Bank’s Haissl is confident about Tesla’s prospects though, saying he expects a solid second quarter with significant free cash flow.“We remain optimistic about Tesla’s ability to generate material free cash flow going forward, as higher volumes and working capital inflows more than offset higher investments, versus as low level in Q1,” Haissl said.“The market still underestimates Tesla’s technological and cost advantage, which will eventually result in superior returns and continued market share gains,” Haissl said.As a former European Automotive correspondent for Reuters, I’ve a spent a few years writing about the industry. I will penetrate the corporate hype and bluster and find ...

Title: In a throwback, Musk’s tweets target Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard - Los Angeles Times
Author: Russ Mitchell
Body: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk turned to Twitter on Sunday to open up old wounds with one of Tesla’s co-founders before announcing he had “deleted” his Twitter account.Musk ripped into Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard, stating that “Tesla is alive in spite of Eberhard, but he seeks credit constantly and fools give it [to] him.” The tweet was later deleted. Musk, meanwhile, briefly changed his Twitter name to Daddy Dotcom, said he had deleted his Twitter account, and swapped out his Twitter photo for a solid black disc.The account was still up and running on Monday, although he hadn’t tweeted anything new beyond the Sunday night “Just deleted my Twitter account” message.The bizarre chain of events started with a Twitter discussion on whether artists should be credited for work posted on Twitter. “No one should be credited with anything,” Musk tweeted. That drew a response from someone named Mawk: “Martin Eberhard is responsible for all of Tesla’s success.” Musk shot back.Tesla had no comment. Eberhard, now chairman and chief technology officer of electric vehicle battery start-up Tiveni, could not be reached.Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning started Tesla together in 2003. They soon brought Musk in as an investor. Musk, a co-founder of PayPal, got rich after PayPal was sold to EBay in 2002, and he initially sank $6.5 million into Tesla.The details of the ensuing feud between Eberhard and Musk are subject to debate. But Musk gradually took control of the company and Eberhard was fired in 2007. Musk became Tesla’s chief executive in 2008.Eberhard later sued Musk for libel and slander, in part for minimizing Eberhard’s contributions and claiming to be a co-founder of Tesla. The suit was settled for undisclosed terms, but Eberhard did agree that Musk and two others should be considered co-founders.Musk’s Twitter account has proved an invaluable marketing tool for Tesla. But his tweets have also cost him.Just deleted my Twitter accountIn one case, Musk was charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and later with contempt of court. In another, Musk was sued by a cave-dive rescuer after Musk called the man a “pedo” and “child rapist” on Twitter.In the SEC case, the government agency filed fraud charges after Musk tweeted in August that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. The tweet propelled the stock price higher, but it later fell after Musk failed to provide any evidence such a deal was in the works.Musk settled the SEC charges with a promise to restrain his Twitter behavior. Months later, the SEC charged him with contempt of court for violating that promise. Musk settled that charge earlier this year, with a longer, more clearly defined list of subjects that he was not allowed to tweet about without first getting clearance from a company lawyer.The CEO since has curtailed tweeting information that could be considered material to Tesla’s financial prospects, although his emails to employees that contain such information have since been leaked to the media.Musk also faces a defamation lawsuit from the rescue diver, Vernon Unsworth, who helped lead the summer 2018 rescue of 12 Thai children and their soccer coach who were trapped in a cave after floodwaters blocked the exit. Musk and his team came up with a mini-submarine to help with the rescue, but after Unsworth minimized Musk’s contributions, Musk hit back on Twitter.Last week, Unworth was honored for heroism at Buckingham Palace with several others from the British rescue team. Unsworth received the Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire medal. Unsworth’s lawsuit goes to court in December.

            Elon Musk's Twitter account "just deleted," Tesla founder says - CBS News
    
Author: Anonymous
Body: Watch CBSN Live Updated on: June 17, 2019 / 12:18 PM / CBS/AP Serial-tweeting Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter Sunday night that he "just deleted" his account, 10 months after his use of the social media site to pump up the electric car company's investment prospects landed him in trouble with U.S. securities regulators. However, Musk's account was still listed as active on Twitter as of Monday morning, suggesting the tweet was a joke and prompting many amused responses from his followers.Musk's strange weekend on Twitter also included a display name change to "Daddy DotCom" on Father's Day. Daddy.com is an existing website that provides parenting information to new and expecting fathers.Just deleted my Twitter accounthi guys it’s pretty easy to fact check whether someone has deleted his twitter account or not kthxgoingbacktomyvacationbyeMusk also lashed out against former Tesla CEO Martin Eberhard Saturday night, claiming Tesla is successful "in spite" of Eberhard, reported Business Insider. Eberhard, who is now the chairman of an electric vehicle battery startup called Tiveni, co-founded Tesla in 2003, but was fired from the startup in 2007 in an ouster led by Musk. Tesla accused the former CEO of leaving the company finances in "shambles.""Tesla is alive in spite of Eberhard, but he seeks credit constantly & fools give it him," Musk reportedly said in response to an anonymous user. Musk got in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August for tweeting he had secured funding to take Tesla private, without any evidence to support the claim. Tesla stock rose on his tweet and fell on the aftermath. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in September to settle with the SEC.As part of the court settlement, Musk is required to have Twitter posts approved by a company lawyer if they have the potential to affect the company's stock.Some investors may have appreciated Musk's vow of silence on Twitter: Tesla's share price increased nearly 2.5% in Monday morning trading to about $220.

Title: Tesla Insiders Are Using This Options Strategy to Pocket Huge Sums | Fortune
Author: Anonymous
Body: The insiders want their money out.Many Tesla outside investors and analysts have been jumping ship from the “quagmire” some see the company having become, as Fortune previously reported. But it’s not just them. Some Tesla insiders—directors and current and former officers—have been consistently exercising options and then selling most or all of those shares, pulling millions of dollars out in the process, according to documents reviewed by Fortune.Data from public filings and Factset Research, compiled for Fortune by Management CV, which monitors activity of senior executives that run public companies, shows that a number of insiders have, over the 18 months through June 10, 2019, performed combinations of purchases and sales that have left them with millions of dollars in net proceeds and roughly the same amount of stock as they already had.The data show that some directors and executives were exercising options to buy stock at far below current market prices and selling virtually identical numbers of shares at market prices on the same days, thereby extracting value. The purchases and sales appear to have happened under a so-called Rule 10b5-1 plan, in which executives set their buying and selling strategies and schedules in advance so they can’t be accused of insider trading.While there is nothing illegal or unheard of about this process, it raises potential red flags for investors. First, it becomes more difficult for individual investors who may depend on annual proxy statements and other SEC filings to track insider selling, and lack the necessary research time and other data sources to see the trading patterns.Second, the trading raises the question of whether insiders, who may have held some low-strike-price options for years without having to buy the shares, think the stock remains a good longer-term investment. Although Tesla stock has seen substantial recovery in the last week, rising from the June 3 close of $178.97 to $213.91 a share at the end of Thursday, the share price is still far below its level of nearly $350 in mid-January 2019.Occasional examples of essentially flipping options can be found in other companies, including other auto manufacturers. What stood out to experts was the concentration of insiders engaging in this strategy at Tesla, something an examination of some filings did not show before this 18-month period.The theory behind using options or stock as compensation is that executives will have similar interests to shareholders, and everyone will hope to make money from increased share value over time. In this case, some of the insiders exercised older options with strike prices in the $20 to $30 range and then immediately sold them, profiting in the difference between the strike and current prices.The insiders weren’t selling shares they already explicitly held. In addition, over time, they’ve received additional options at much higher strike prices. “Nominally, my beneficial equity stake is the same as it was, but what I’ve done is extract that wealth,” said Management CV CEO Renny Ponvert, of the data. Insiders who follow this pattern may have less “real money at risk,” as Ponvert said, meaning their interests may not seem as aligned with those of outside shareholders.Tesla and the insiders did not respond to a request to Tesla for comment.Some examples are Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners, which was the first institutional investor in Tesla, according to a case study prepared by University of Chicago Booth School of Business professor Steven Kaplan. Valor invested $14.5 million into the company, generating almost $140 million for its funds before exiting the investment in 2012.Gracias has been the lead independent director of Tesla since 2007. Over the last 18 months, he netted out $28.4 million in cash through selling shares and exercising options, at prices around $30 a share. However, the total number of shares that he bought and sold after the transactions during the year-and-a-half exactly balanced, so he had planned to sell as fast as he exercised them. As of the end of 2018, he still had options left for 288,600 shares and held 500,826 shares, according to the latest Tesla proxy statement.Chief technical officer Jeffrey Straubel netted out $26.7 million over the 18-month period, exercising options at anywhere from $20.72 to $31.49 a share. He ended up with a net drop of 20,000 shares. An SEC Form 4, required to show stock transactions of insiders, showed him on May 28, 2019 buying 15,000 shares at $31.49 each and selling 15,000 at prices ranging from $188.48 to $194.58. At the end, he still held 306,398 shares, essentially flipping the exercised options. Straubel has used the same pattern of buying and selling 15,000 shares, always maintaining the total 306,398 shares, six times between Dec. 28, 2018 and May 28, 2019.Brad Buss has been on the Tesla board since 2009 and is listed as an independent director. He was the CFO for SolarCity, the solar panel installation company co-founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, until 2016, the year that Tesla bought the company. Musk had also been chairman of SolarCity. Buss pulled out $17.9 million from his shares, finishing with a net increase of 4,666 shares. He had 204,082 option shares outstanding and held 165,790 shares at the end of 2018.Deepak Ahuja served twice as CFO of Tesla, first from 2008 to 2015 and then again from 2017 until he left the company early in 2019. Ahuja netted $4.2 million. At the end of 2018, he owned 95,465 shares.Elon Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, made $2.9 million with a net disposal of 2,190 shares and at the end of 2018 had 209,444 shares and options for an additional 100,000.Douglas Field, who left Apple to join Tesla and then returned to the consumer electronics giant in 2018, took out almost $3.1 million with a net drop of 1989 shares. At the end of 2017, he had 42,728 shares, according to the Tesla 2018 proxy statement.There are many possible explanations for why a given insider might decide to sell shares, including paying taxes on exercised options, freeing cash to diversify holdings, or covering some bill like the cost of a child’s college education. In fact, in a few cases, an examination of SEC filings showed that some sales of shares were automatic to cover taxes. Some older options from 2012 had expiration dates in 2019, which could have prompted their exercise, although it wouldn’t necessarily explain the immediate sale of the resulting shares. Insiders often treat options as a way of holding potential shares while delaying any cash outlay.“You can never fully understand or determine what is going on inside the profile of one individual director and his or her financial plans,” said Bill Francavilla, an investment advisor. “But if several [insiders] are selling and you see a trend, that might be something different.”For example, if a number of insiders are flipping most or all the shares they acquire from exercising options, it could also be a sign they have less confidence in the future value of the shares. “I would be suspicious and expect to pay a lot more attention if I was a shareholder,” Francavilla said.One clear exception to any broader patterns is Elon Musk. Over the 18-month period, he spent $95.2 million on 470,139 shares and did not sell any. Of the shares he purchased, 175,000 were options he exercised at a strike price of $31.17. The rest, however, were purchased at anywhere from $243 to $351.40 a share.There are four common reasons why someone in Musk’s position might be bulking up his holdings, particularly when buying shares on open markets: to signal to shareholders his belief in the company, to build a bigger shareholder voting position, to deal with demands from bank loans, or to short the stock.Trying to build a bigger voting position seems highly unlikely. The number of shares he’s gained are insignificant in comparison to either the nearly 38.6 million he already holds, according to the 2019 proxy statement, or the total number of outstanding shares. Given Musk’s antagonism toward short sellers, taking such a position might also seem unlikely, although certainly conceivable and one impossible to discern from the outside.That leaves two potential reasons. One is to promote faith in the company.“We’ve seen a lot of executives of public companies buying,” said Timothy Speiss, co-leader of the personal wealth advisors group at EisnerAmper. “It’s often that they’re buying form their heart and they’re trying to show support for the company.”However, in Musk’s case, Tesla’s 2019 proxy statement shows that he has “13,394,056 shares pledged as collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness,” which is almost 35% of the 38.6 million shares he beneficially owns.That is down somewhat from the 13,774,897 pledged in 2018 but up considerably from 11,450,723 pledged in 2017.Investor Danny Moses, who does hold short positions on Tesla stock, thinks that at least part of Musk’s purchases are because of a cash crunch. In early 2019, Musk took out $61 million in mortgages on five properties in California, according to the Los Angeles Times.According to the Tesla proxy statement, the company’s board requires that “the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock.” With the lower share value, it could be that outstanding loans might have exceeded the value of the stock, which would mean Musk would need more shares to meet the requirement.A Tesla spokesperson called the suggestion that the purchase was a pledge requirement “patently false” and added that Musk was only trying to convey confidence in the stock.Whatever the reasons for all the trading, investors might want to look closely before catching a ride with Tesla.—A red flag to investors: The stock market may be hitting the “triple top”—The Renault deal is dead, but Fiat Chrysler still needs a partner—Many economists think the next recession will be before the 2020 election—The S&P 500 has performed far worse under Trump than Obama—Listen to our new audio briefing, Fortune 500 DailyDon’t miss the daily Term Sheet, Fortune‘s newsletter on deals and dealmakers.

Title: Why Tesla Stock Jumped Monday
Author: Anonymous
Body: Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Monday, rising 5.5% as of 2:50 p.m. EDT.The stock's gain comes as one analyst pegs traders' covering of short positions on Tesla stock as a potential reason for the gain. In addition, a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating that he deleted his Twitter account may have encouraged some investors.Image source: Tesla.Tesla stock's sharp rise on Monday may be related to "the start of short covering over the next few weeks," said Baird analyst Ben Kallo, according to Benzinga. When a large number of traders with short positions cover their trades by purchasing shares, it sometimes causes a stock to rise in the near term, creating a "short squeeze."Kallo has a $340 12-month price target on Tesla shares.In addition, over the weekend Musk tweeted, "Just deleted my Twitter account." Given the troubles Musk's active and outspoken usage of Twitter has led to in the past, many shareholders would likely view the CEO's absence on the social media platform as a net positive.Notably, Musk's Twitter account doesn't appear to be deleted as of Monday afternoon. But the CEO hasn't tweeted since.While these two events may be reasons for Tesla stock's rise on Monday, investors should remain focused on the electric-car maker's fundamentals. The company needs to ramp up production while keeping costs in check in order to meet its full-year vehicle deliveries guidance and achieve profitability.

Title:     Elon Musk deletes tweet attacking Tesla cofounder Martin Eberhard - Business Insider

Author: Graham Rapier
Body: Tesla CEO Elon Musk had an interesting weekend on Twitter. His strange few days on the social network culminated in a name change to "Daddy DotCom" and a tweet that he had just "deleted" his account (which as of Monday morning was not the case), but not before he took the time to lash out at the company's cofounder Martin Eberhard. Twitter "Tesla is alive in spite of Eberhard, but he seeks credit constantly & fools give it him," Musk said around 11 p.m. Saturday night in response to an anonymous user who said Eberhard was responsible for all of Tesla's success. Eberhard, now the chief technology officer and chairman of an electric-vehicle-battery startup called Tiveni, was fired from Tesla in 2007. Two years later, Eberhard filed a defamation lawsuit against Musk, which was eventually dropped. At the time, Tesla accused Eberhard of being a poor CEO who "left the company's finances in shambles."Read more: Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the amount of time he spends on Twitter is 'like, almost nothing' Business Insider reported at the time that Eberhard's contract included a non-disparagement clause, though it's not clear if the agreement was reciprocal. Business Insider reached out to Eberhard for comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's flurry of weekend tweeting also included comments about crediting artists for their work, which was met with much criticism. "No one should be credited with anything ever," he said in a now deleted tweet after being asked to credit an artist whose work he shared to his 27 million followers.
