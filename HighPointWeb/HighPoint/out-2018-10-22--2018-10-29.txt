Title: Surprise! Tesla Is Quietly Taking Over the Luxury Car Market | Inc.com
Author: Anonymous
Body: While everyone has been distracted by the Shakespearean drama that is Tesla under Elon Musk, something's been happening under the radar: The automaker is quietly gaining an ever-larger share of the U.S. luxury car market, according to new research by the automotive site Edmunds. Just how much of a share? Statistics about Tesla are always a little iffy since the famously closed-mouthed automaker doesn't share its sales numbers or break its delivery numbers down by nation or region. But Edmunds analyzed things like registration records and estimated that Tesla sold 64,727 luxury cars in the third quarter of this year. That's just a couple of thousand less than Mercedes-Benz, and more than Cadillac and Lincoln combined. (Would you have believed a decade ago that an electric car could outsell Caddy and Lincoln combined? I wouldn't.)Edmunds' analysis indicates that Tesla has been gaining on its gas-powered competitors over time. And it's worth noting that, at least where the Model 3 is concerned, what's limited Tesla sales has been supply not demand--there's still a waiting list of people who want the car but can't yet get one. With Model 3 production having reached its goal of 5,000 a week back in June, and at least near that level since, Tesla stands to grab even more of the luxury car market share.Embedded in these stats is a fact that might not please Elon Musk: With a starting price of $49,000 the Tesla Model 3--while much more affordable than the company's six-figure models--still counts as a luxury car. In fact, it likely has a higher average price than other luxury cars, according to Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo. Since Teslas are sold in company-owned stores rather than traditional dealerships, Edmunds can't calculate what the average sales price actually is, although Tesla is known for not offering discounts. Still, this is all very good news for Tesla's bottom line. Even before the surprise earnings report this week showing that the company turned a profit last quarter, short-selling information site Citron Research reversed its position on Tesla, and Tesla's dominance of both the luxury car market and the electric car market is what changed the company's mind. "While the media has been focused on Elon Musk's eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being DOMINATED by Tesla," the company explained in its report reversing its position. Citron goes on to share a few charts that show just how powerful Tesla's market position is. In addition to its growing strength in the luxury car market overall, Citron notes that the Model S is by far the best selling large luxury car. As of this past quarter, Tesla is also crushing its competition in the electric car market. Now that Model 3 production is up to speed, Citron's charts estimate that it sold 54,550 Model 3s, 8,000 Model S vehicles and 7,000 Model X vehicles in the third quarter. (That total is a bit higher than Edmunds' but again these are all estimates.) If these charts are correct, the Nissan Leaf, once the best selling electric car in the world, was outsold by the Model 3 in the third quarter by a factor of more than 10 to 1.The next challenge for Musk and Tesla is to finally offer a car that doesn't price itself into the luxury category, a challenge that was supposed to be met with the Model 3. Faced with the need to increase production and achieve profitability, the company chose to focus first on the more expensive version of that model, and that decision seems to have paid off. But now Tesla and its customers can become victims of its success. After a car maker sells 200,000 electric cars, the $7,500 tax credit for buying one starts to disappear. Tesla recently confirmed that it had sold more than 200,000 cars, which means the incentive for Teslas is set to phase out next year, getting cut in half to $3,750 on January 1, and halved again to $1,875 on July 1. At the end of 2019, it vanishes altogether. Meanwhile, Musk has said that Tesla will start producing the $35,000 Model 3 late this year with mass production beginning next year. But skeptics predict that production won't start at all until sometime next year, and of course Musk is famous for setting difficult deadlines for his company, and then missing them. Whenever it does arrive, the $35,000 Model 3 will likely be met with enthusiasm, as mid-market car buyers finally get their chance at a Tesla.

Title: Guess What? Everyone Was Wrong About Tesla
Author: Anonymous
Body: Flags fly outside of a Tesla Inc. building in Fremont, California, U.S., on Wednesday, June 20, 2018. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed another general assembly line to reach its production targets for the Model 3 vehicle. "A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks," Musk said on Twitter. Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergPretty much everything has been said about Tesla: it was selling vehicles at a loss and would never be able to make them under the right conditions and fast enough, that its founder was crazy and would lead the company to ruin, while one industry veteran acclaimed the Model S, calling on car collectors to buy one “before the company goes belly up.” But this quarter, Tesla has not only made tons of money, boosting its share price and giving the NASDAQ its best day in months, but has also fulfilled its production and distribution objectives, showing every sign of staying in the black, at least until it has to pay interest on loans in the first quarter of next year.For once, this third quarter does not seem to be the exception: everything indicates the company has found a stable way to generate profits. What’s more, Tesla is no longer an industry quirk: many have laughed at its production difficulties, grossly underestimating the achievement of moving from a standing start to mass producing 80,000 vehicles per quarter, but the company is now outselling Porsche, Mercedes Benz and BMW, making it the best-selling domestically-made car in the United States, and what’s more with a model that while expensive, is more advanced technologically, as well as cheaper and much safer to run that its internal combustion powered competitors.This quarter’s spectacular results have confounded the analysts’ forecasts, proving what some of us have been saying for a while now, that few in the motor industry and its so-called experts few understand the strategic vision of a company prepared to take risks to change the world. Virtually everyone was wrong about Tesla’s finances and its future, and many analysts are now scratching their heads trying to understand what happened while still making recommendations of questionable credibility. For one thing, most analysts simply can’t get their head round the idea that a company’s customers would volunteer to help distribute its vehicles, contributing to a project they consider themselves part of. Elon Musk will doubtless be basking in the warm glow of his “I told you so” triumph, because he does understand that people want to be part of a project that is not about selling cars, but changing the world. Understanding a business model like Tesla’s means understanding that the biggest difficulties aren’t necessarily the ones you imagine. Tesla has shown that difficult challenges can be overcome, as many other companies have done before. It has shown that it’s possible to design long-term strategies and implement them successfully, even if that means having to listen to baseless nonsense from people who don’t understand what it is we are doing. For example, that the company was wrong not to locate in China, that its production costs were unsustainable and would drive it out of business. Yet Tesla’s assembly line is now making progressive savings as production increases, and next year, depending on global demand, it could even consider moving a part of its manufacturing to China: now, not before.Meanwhile, the company’s profit margin on every Model 3 it sells is now around 20%, well above the industry average in its segment, and overnight its prospects for growth and profitability now seem not only credible, but probable, regardless of the belief in some quarters that Musk is crazy. The world would be a better place with a few more crazy people like him in positions of leadership.The best thing about all this is that we’re not even talking about an automotive company here. Sure, while some still insist on seeing Tesla as a car manufacturer and now begrudgingly accept that it’s not doing too badly thanks to its road map, it turns out that the price of batteries continues to fall, that demand for solar power installations grows as more and more batteries are produced and sold not only for vehicles but for homes and storage plants, and that hey presto, the company has miraculously found itself in one of the fastest-growing sectors as the evidence shows that long-standing environmental concerns are fully justified. Suddenly, it turns out there are many years of hard work behind Tesla’s overnight success.In other words, people who say it can’t be done should stop interrupting those who are doing it.

Citing sources familiar with the case, the Journal reports that the investigation is heating up, with FBI agents contacting former Tesla employees asking them for testimony in the criminal case. Some ex-employees were subpoenaed, and the FBI is seeking to interview several of them. The government’s investigation is said to stretch back to early 2017, when Tesla first began to publicize projections about the Model 3 production. Under examination is the company’s public statements about Model 3 productions as compared to the number of vehicles that were actually built. The company recently turned its first quarterly profit in two years after smoothing out what Tesla CEO Elon Musk called “production hell” on the Model 3. In early 2017, Musk laid out an aggressive production plan for the Model 3, predicting it would be producing 20,000 vehicles a month by December 2017. “Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec,” he tweeted on in July, a few days before Model 3 assembly began in earnest. But production delays and miscalculations resulted in only 2,700 Model 3s being built in all of 2017. The company finally reached its goal of building 5,000 Model 3 vehicles in one week in June 2018, but recently fell below that number. Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in DecIn a statement, a spokesperson said Tesla received a “voluntary request for documents from the Department of Justice about its public guidance for the Model 3 ramp” and that the company was cooperating. “We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson continued, “When we started the Model 3 production ramp, we were transparent about how difficult it would be, openly explaining that we would only be able to go as fast as our least lucky or least successful supplier, and that we were entering ‘production hell.’ Ultimately, given difficulties that we did not foresee in this first-of-its-kind production ramp, it took us six months longer than we expected to meet our 5,000 unit per week guidance. Tesla’s philosophy has always been to set truthful targets – not sandbagged targets that we would definitely exceed and not unrealistic targets that we could never meet. While Tesla gets criticized when it is delayed in reaching a goal, it should not be forgotten that Tesla has achieved many goals that were doubted by most. We are enormously proud of the efforts of the whole company in making it through this difficult ramp and getting us to volume production.”Last month, Musk settled a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he committed fraud when tweeting he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, when he did not. The Department of Justice is also probing Musk’s statements. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

Title: Tesla Finally Makes a Profit While Increasing Model 3 Production, and Promises to Keep Doing It | WIRED
Author: Anonymous
Body: People usually have three questions about Tesla and Elon Musk’s promises: When can I get a $35,000 Model 3? Can Teslas drive themselves? And can Tesla actually make money selling electric cars?The answer to the first two, when Musk is asked, is usually something along the lines of “in six months or so.” On the third question, he’s been clearer. He pledged that the automaker would be profitable before the end of 2018.Tesla just released its financial results for the third quarter of the year and reported a net profit of $312 million, finally allowing Musk to keep a promise. “We delivered more cars in this quarter than in all of 2016,” the CEO said on a call to discuss the numbers.Proving that Tesla can make a profit has been a crusade for Musk, and the figure is higher than most analysts had estimated. He’s said that the criticism of the company—that it has to be profitable to be viable in the long term —is fair, and that he's been eager to prove the doubters wrong. One quarter in the black is a start, but Musk will have to keep this up to accelerate away from doubts about the long-term future.“Q3 2018 was a truly historic quarter for Tesla,” the company said in today’s investor update letter. A grandiose line? Sure. Hyperbolic? Not that much. Tesla released production numbers for the quarter at the start of this month, which showed it delivered 52,239 Model 3s. Add in the Model S and X, and that's a record more than 80,000 vehicles delivered between July and September.At the end of the quarter, Tesla actually welcomed existing customers as volunteers to help deliver cars, as that became the new bottleneck. “I’ve never heard of a case where customers volunteered their time to help a company succeed,” said Musk. “That’s amazing. It chokes me up actually.”This news is all the sweeter given what Tesla has endured in 2018. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Musk with misleading investors when he tweeted his plan to take the company private, resulting in a $40 million fine (half for him, half for the company), and having him step aside as chairman of the board of directors.The company laid off 9 percent of the workforce in June, saying that it was a difficult but necessary reorganization. Moreover, Tesla has continued to struggle with quality control. Coincidentally, just released as well are the latest reliability rankings from Consumer Reports, showing the automaker slipping to 29th place out of 29—mostly due to issues with the Model S. The Model 3, which is less complex, has “average” reliability. Oh, and Musk also smoked weed on a podcast.But making money seems to trump all, and Tesla shares are riding high even as the rest of the stock market is slumping.The positive financial results come as Tesla launched a new, lower-priced version of the Model 3. This isn’t the long-awaited mass market, “standard range” vehicle that will have a redesigned battery and cost $35,000. This is a long-range battery pack with some cells left out, sold as a “midrange” car as Tesla looks to keep sales moving in the fourth quarter this year. It was originally $45,000, but overnight the price crept up $1,000, as Tesla likely adjusts to demand.The car is also an olive branch to customers who placed a $1,000 deposit in 2016, in hope of securing a cheap Tesla. Although this car isn’t what Musk promised, it will likely mean US customers can get a cheap-ish car before the end of 2018, after which the federal tax credit for EVs of $7,500 starts to phase out for Tesla.Tesla now says it makes a 20 percent gross profit margin on the Model 3, which is up there with luxury trucks and cars, and higher than most cheaper cars. Much of it is due to selling higher-end, expensive models, like all-wheel drive and performance versions for as much as $77,000.But the company reported the gross profit margin for the Model 3 will stay the same even as lower-price cars are snapped up by impatient buyers. The company says it’s constantly making savings and improvements in the manufacturing process. “Labor hours per Model 3 decreased by more than 30 percent from Q2 to Q3,” Tesla says, “falling for the first time below the level for Model S and X. In Q4, we will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate.”Musk also tweeted this week that Tesla would be cutting the number of options available for interior choices (like type of wood, color of leather) on Model S and X vehicles, as the company works to streamline production. On the Model 3, it currently only offers two interior options, black or white seats.Tesla actually has had profitable quarters before; the last was in the third quarter of 2016, during production hell for the Model X, as it’s now doing with the 3. (Now as then, Musk sent an email to employees imploring them to help show investors Tesla could be profitable.) The only other profitable quarter was back in 2013, when it started to fill early Model S preorders.Tesla’s not alone in burning through cash as it’s vying to grow and develop as a business. Amazon went public in 1997 but didn’t have a full profitable year until 2003. Twitter still hasn’t had an entire year in the black. And the big automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, both lost so much money in the global financial crisis that they declared bankruptcy in 2009 and relied on government money to recover.But Musk indicated unprofitable days were over for his company. “Our aspiration will be for all quarters going forward, we can be positive cash flow,” he said. But he then added in a caveat—saying that didn’t count quarters, like the fist one of next year, where the company has to make a major payment on loans.As for answering those other questions, Musk said the company is making good progress on self-driving, but needs its new computer chip, which won’t go into cars until the beginning of next year, at the earliest. What's more, Tesla doesn’t have the ability to build the $35,000 Model 3 right away and stay profitable, but he hopes the $46,000 one is a step in that direction.Musk then threw in reminders of his commitments to the Tesla Semi, Roadster, pickup truck, and solar tile roof on the call, almost as throwaways. "I think we have the most exciting hardware road map of any company by far," he said. If he can fulfill all these promises, then Tesla has a good 2019 ahead of it.Tesla has just delivered the first 30 models of its most crucial car, the Model 3. The new addition to the Tesla family is supposed to be the “affordable” car, starting at $35,000. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says over half a million people have already paid $1000 to reserve their Model 3.CNMN Collection© 2018 Condé Nast.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) 3Q Earnings: The Stock Demands More - Bloomberg
Author: Anonymous
Body: The electric car maker must keep up the latest quarter's performance to justify the hopes already embedded in its valuation.The electric car maker must keep up the latest quarter's performance to justify the hopes already embedded in its valuation.Tesla delivered, but the stock price demands more.Tesla delivered, but the stock price demands more.With numbers like these coming, you have to wonder why Elon Musk was so vexed by the short sellers. Because, in the same quarter Tesla Inc.’s CEO indulged in that weird $420 takeover episode, the electric car company actually generated very good results.As promised, Tesla generated a GAAP profit of $1.75 per diluted share. It also turned in positive cash from operations of almost $1.4 billion, and generated free cash flow for the first time in eight quarters, to the tune of $881 million. Working capital changes helped that some, and capital expenditure came in a bit light. But it is still an impressive number. This enabled Tesla to end September with just shy of $3 billion in the bank, reversing the steady increase in net debt:Positive free cash flow reversed a steady increase in Tesla&aposs net debtSource: TeslaHigher margins on the Model 3 provided a significant boost. Even adjusting for the sale of zero-emission vehicle credits – an irregular top-up to Tesla’s earnings over the years – the automotive gross margin came in above 25 percent. It remains to be seen whether Tesla also sold other regulatory credits; it only discloses those in its 10-Q filing, and they have moved the needle substantially at various points in the past. Still, on the face of it, I estimate it made almost $5,500 of pre-tax profit on each vehicle. In particular, research and development and selling, general and administrative costs were noticeably held down even as revenue jumped.Tesla flipped to a pre-tax profit for the first time in two yearsSource: Tesla, Bloomberg Opinion analysisNote: Automotive revenue less cost of goods sold, less R&D, SG&A, net interest and other costs in proportion to the automotive business&apos share of total revenue.One of the big questions hanging over these results is whether they will be sustained. Tesla flipped the script similarly in the third quarter of 2016 (another time Musk was bent on rebutting “naysayers”). Back then, though, ZEV credit sales and pushing out supplier payments were the big swing factors. This time, Tesla can instead point to high sales of vehicles, especially of higher-priced versions of the Model 3.What remains to be seen is if margins can remain healthy as demand migrates down to lower-priced versions – such as the $35,000 Model 3 that Tesla has yet to introduce. For Tesla’s part, it says it can keep the gross margin on the Model 3 “stable” this quarter while operating expenses rise only slightly. The answer to this question of operating leverage is critical.We aren’t going to know about that for a quarter or two at least. Still, Tesla’s stock jumped 11 percent in after-market trading anyway. At about $320 a share, that implies 34 times forecast 2020 earnings. Boost those forecast earnings by half off the back of these results, and the multiple would still be 23 times.That is still a lot of goodwill for a company whose recent history has been so volatile. Amid the good stuff, there were still some issues lurking in Tesla’s results. For example, average Model 3 weekly production of 4,300 in the third quarter remained light relative to earlier guidance, and production is expected to “increase” by an unspecified amount this quarter. The vaunted “solar roof” product, first unveiled in late 2016 when Tesla was in the throes of closing the SolarCity Corp. acquisition, remains in “intensive reliability testing.” And while there was a notable improvement, Tesla’s indebtedness and negative working capital remain high.On that front, Tesla ought to use any share-price strength to raise more capital, especially given its ambitious growth plans. This is still a cyclical business, and Tesla’s recent, sometimes bizarre history – born of weak governance – cannot just be erased. A good quarter and some promised reforms (at the SEC’s prodding) are welcome. But Tesla must do a lot more, and sustainably, to justify the hopes already embedded in its stock.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.net

The automaker said on Wednesday that it generated $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 and walked away with $311 million in profit — the most the company has ever made in a quarter. The company finished the quarter with $3 billion in cash, up $731 million from the second quarter of the year. Tesla’s last two profitable quarters came in 2013 and 2016, and it has never made a profit over an entire year.“Q3 2018 was a truly historic quarter for Tesla,” CEO Elon Musk and CFO Deepak Ahuja wrote in a letter to investors. “Model 3 is attracting customers of both premium and non-premium brands, making it a truly mainstream product.”The turning of financial fortunes can be largely attributed to how Tesla nearly doubled production of the Model 3 from the second quarter to the third this year. In fact, the company has made so many cars recently that it overwhelmed itself with delivery efforts, switching from so-called “production hell” to “delivery logistics hell,” as Musk famously put it. “Fortunately, these challenges are easier to solve than vehicle manufacturing, and we made improvements through the quarter,” Musk and Ahuja write. In total, Tesla wound up delivering 56,065 Model 3s in North America in the third quarter, which is 225 more than it said when it announced initial delivery counts for the quarter in early October. The company also sounds ready to cash in on demand in other markets, with Musk and Ahuja saying Tesla will start taking orders in Europe and China for the Model 3 “before the end of this year.” After finally turning a profit on the Model 3 earlier this year, Tesla now says it is now pulling in more than a 20 percent margin on the car. It did this thanks to a reduced cost of raw materials, but also by cutting the number of labor hours needed to make each Model 3. Tesla says this figure dropped 30 percent from the second quarter to the third, and that it now takes less time to produce a Model 3 than to make a Model S or X. Also helping boost the company into profit was the sale of $52 million worth of zero-emission vehicle credits to other automakers.Tesla says it is still targeting early 2019 for the launch of the long-promised $35,000, 220-mile version of the Model 3. The company delayed the most affordable version of its small electric sedan in order to focus on the higher-cost, higher-margin versions. Musk even said this year that focusing on the lower-cost Model 3 would cause the company to “die.” The delay, combined with the fact that Tesla’s cars are now no longer eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, has contributed to some cancellations. But Tesla says demand for the Model 3 remains strong, and that “less than 20 percent” of the 455,000 reservation holders have asked for a refund. The company also says that it doesn’t expect selling lower-priced cars to impact profitability long term.Despite the boost in production’s effect on Tesla’s bottom line, the company is still running into problems related to that explosion in scale. Tesla has had problems with customer service, with Musk recently admitting that the company has “major gaps” in its nationwide coverage. And while the company’s cars consistently earn some of the highest safety ratings in the industry, its widely documented quality control issues continue to plague customers new and old. Before the earnings letter dropped on Wednesday, Consumer Reports said that Tesla ranked the third worst for reliability among major automakers. Tesla also has more than $10 billion in debt, with more than $1 billion due in the next six months. This, along with future projects like the Model Y crossover, Tesla Semi, and factories in Europe and China, has had many financial analysts expecting Tesla to raise new money sometime soon. But an increase in cash on hand coupled with increasing revenue from other parts of Tesla’s business — like its energy generation and storage business, which increased by $25 million to just shy of $400 million this quarter — could help Musk continue to make his case that he won’t need to take more of anyone else’s money. The release of the quarterly letter wraps one of the wildest quarters in Tesla’s history, which is saying something for a company with as many ups and downs as a reality TV show. On August 7th, just days after the company recapped its second quarter performance, Musk made a surprise announcement on Twitter about how he was considering taking the publicly traded company private again. Musk said he wanted to delist the company from the NASDAQ once its stock price hit $420 per share and claimed that he had “funding secured” to back the potentially massive buyout required to pull off such a move. Musk, it turned out, did not have any funding secured. The $420 share price cutoff he suggested was, in part, a joke about weed meant to impress his girlfriend, the musician Grimes. Less than two months after Musk sent those tweets, he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for committing securities fraud. The SEC’s complaint, built largely on subpoenaed internal communications at Tesla, showed that Musk’s privatization attempt (and the way he went about it) was also a surprise to many of the people inside the company. While Musk had told Tesla’s board of directors that he was considering the idea, he didn’t give them a heads-up that he was about to make a public announcement. Tesla’s CFO had to email Musk shortly after his first tweets to suggest the company draft an official press release, and the company’s head of Investor Relations spent the hours and days after reassuring shareholders that the plan was legitimate, despite a lack of evidence to support that claim. Musk quickly settled the suit. He agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla for three years, and both he and Tesla were ordered to pay $20 million fines. The company has been ordered to hire a lawyer to oversee all of his public communications, including his tweets. As it moves into the final quarter of 2018, Tesla still has to name a successor Musk as chairman of the board of directors. The board is also getting two new independent directors as a result of the settlement with the SEC, though one of those roles can be filled by the new chairman. Tesla also reiterated plans to accelerate its manufacturing timeline in China. The company recently signed off on a lease for the land outside Shanghai where it plans to build a new Gigafactory, and on Wednesday it said it is “aiming to bring portions of Model 3 production to China during 2019.” China has been an increasingly important market for Tesla over the years, but the recent trade war with the US has caused the company’s cars to be subjected to a 40 percent tariff. Beyond that, Musk said the upcoming Model Y crossover has been approved for production, though it still won’t be built until 2020. Musk added that he is “personally most excited about” the Tesla pickup, though. “I think that’s going to be some next level stuff there,” he said.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

The electric car maker said its midsize Model 3 sedan, which it hopes to produce on mass scale, was the best-selling car in the U.S. when measured by revenue and the fifth best-selling car in terms of volume.Musk told analysts on a call it was an "incredibly historic quarter" for the young car company. It was welcome news for investors following an otherwise a tumultuous few months. The company's shares settled after the markets opened but were still up by about 6 percent in morning trading.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates of analysts polled by Refinitiv:Tesla posted net income of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, compared with a loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, a year ago. Revenue surged 70.5 percent from $4 billion from June and more than doubled from a year ago.After one-time adjustments, Tesla earned $516 million during the quarter. It was Tesla's third profitable quarter and compares with an adjusted loss of $520 million during the same period last year.Musk previously said the company would become sustainably profitable by now, having had just two profitable quarters prior to Wednesday's report since it went public in 2010. The company confirmed that it also expects to generate a profit during the fourth quarter.Tesla gave investors hope that its production rates will improve, saying that the number of labor hours to build the Model 3 fell by more than 30 percent from the second to the third quarter, and it took less time to build than the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle — another first for the company.The electric car maker has been struggling to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, telling investors Oct. 2 that it made 53,239 of the vehicles during the quarter. That fell just shy of its goal of producing an average of 5,000 a week, but the company said it built more than 5,300 during the last week of the quarter. "We will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate" during the fourth quarter, the company said.Strong demand for the Model 3 also bolstered the results. Musk told analysts on a call that demand for Model 3s was "probably on the order of anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year."The company said customers were trading in cheaper vehicles to buy a Model 3, "even though there is not yet a leasing option." "This leads us to believe that the total market potential for Model 3 is larger than just the premium sedan," the company said.Musk announced on Twitter Tuesday that the company is limiting certain options on its higher-end Model S sedans and Model X SUVs to streamline production. The company also recently announced plans to start selling a $45,000 version of the Model 3; the price was raised this week to $46,000. It has yet to produce the base Model 3, which it has promised for a price of $35,000 before incentives.The company said it was "working hard" to bring down the price on its Model 3 to $35,000. "Better than expected Model 3 cost reduction is allowing us to bring more affordable options to the market sooner," the company said, noting its slight price cut over the last week. CEO Elon Musk gave guidance that Tesla was probably less than six months from rolling out that lowest priced version of the Model 3.Tesla said it was accelerating its Model 3 production overall, and working to get it started in China where the company just bought land for a factory. "We are definitely going to do local production in China, we are moving rapidly on that," Musk told analysts, adding that Tesla will be producing Model 3s in China next year and, longer-term, will also make batteries there.The company said earlier this month that its factory in Shanghai would help it minimize the impact of tariffs there, which it said increased the tax rate on Teslas sold in China to 40 percent, compared with 15 percent for all other imported cars. The company paid 973 million yuan, or $140 million for an 864,885-square meter plot in Lingang area for the new factory last week.The company's cash position also improved by $731 million during the quarter, despite repaying $82.5 million in bonds, the company said. It said it had $881 million in free cash flow, cash produced through operations minus capital expenses, and expects flat or positive free cash flow next quarter as well, even with greater debt coming due. "Our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash during Q4," the company said.Tesla's had been burning cash at a rate of almost $1 billion per quarter, and is expected to need more to proceed with its plans to build factories in China and Europe. Tesla also needs to invest in its Fremont, California, factory to continue to ramp up production there. It also wants to develop the Model Y, a new roadster and a heavy-duty truck.This is Tesla's first earnings report since the company and Musk agreed to pay a combined $40 million to settle civil fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his Aug. 7 tweets about taking the company private at $420 a share. It's also Musk's last report as chairman for at least three years. The agency is allowing him to stay on as CEO, but gave him 45 days to resign his role running the board as part of the settlement.He declined to answer a question on the earnings call about the search for his replacement.Shares of the company have been whipsawed over the last quarter with record trading volume and wild daily swings, depending on the news. The stock, which closed at $288.50 a share Wednesday, had tumbled by more 25 percent since Musk's now-infamous take-private tweets sent shares soaring to an intraday high of $387.46 a share on Aug. 7.Executives are holding a conference call with investors to discuss the company's results at 6:30 p.m. ET.—CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Robert Ferris contributed to this article.WATCH: Gene Munster gives his take on Tesla earningsGot a confidential news tip?

Title: Tesla transforms into a profitable electric car maker | GreenBiz
Author: Anonymous
Body: What could make Tesla's stock climb enough in a couple short hours to help reverse the months of damage of CEO Elon Musk's "funding secured" $420 tweet, SEC lawsuit, public joint smoking and "pedo" accusations?A little thing called a profit. On Wednesday afternoon, the electric vehicle maker unveiled its third-quarter earnings that included a profit of $311.5 million, its third quarterly profit in its 15-year-history.Musk had predicted that the company would generate a profit in the most recent quarter, but given his spotty track record of missed forecasts, many analysts were caught surprised by the positive net income and substantial cash generation. The profit, of course, largely was driven by Tesla's dramatic boost in manufacturing and deliveries of its newest, and lower cost, Model 3 EV. It's a car that put Tesla, and Musk personally, crawling through Dante's Inferno of "production hell," and resorting to highly unusual tactics such as building an entirely new production line in a tent next to the regular factory production line in Fremont, California. Tesla forecasts that in Q4 it also will have a positive net income. But the company also reached the modest profit by a combination of various other measures, such as a significant cutting of capital expenditures, cost reductions in its solar businesses and an eeking out of more Zero Emissions Vehicle credits. Tesla forecasts that in Q4 it also will have a positive net income.Even better news than Tesla's quarterly profit is its promise of sustainable profits. That's right. Tesla forecasts that in Q4 it also will have a positive net income."Our earnings profile has flipped dramatically," writes the executive team in the company's letter to shareholders: "It's a truly historic quarter." On the company's earnings call, Musk said that Tesla has aspirations for positive cash flow and profitability for "all quarters going forward. " That's a very Musk-ian statement, but you get the picture. While the financial milestone is important for Tesla and its economic sustainability, it's also a major moment for the electric vehicle industry.The number of electric vehicles sold globally is starting to quickly grow, although EVs still make up a small percentage of cars, trucks and buses sold. But Tesla, more than any other company, has led the EV market, launching four models and gaining a cult following over the past decade and a half. The company not only has survived — a real feat in the independent automaker world — but shaped the market and pushed global automakers such as GM and Ford to follow suit.Born in Silicon Valley, seeded by venture capitalists and led by a billionaire Internet entrepreneur, Tesla appears, finally, to be morphing into part mainstream automaker, part engineering tech powerhouse. Despite the constant flow of drama coming off Musk's Twitter feed.Tesla can thank its herculean efforts to make and deliver the Model 3 for its financial pivot. The company says in its shareholder letter that the Model 3 was the bestselling car in the United States in terms of total revenue in the third quarter, beating out Toyota's Camry and Corolla models and Honda's Accord and Civic. Just let that sink in. The Model 3 didn't beat out the electric versions of these mainstream cars, it generated more sales than these internal combustion engine cars. And despite some mixed early reviews of technical issues, the sheer number of Model 3s Tesla is making and delivering is starting to be substantial.Tesla says it delivered 56,065 Model 3s just in the third quarter, and made an average of 4,300 of them per week. Need we remind you that in 2015 Tesla delivered 50,000 cars for the entire year.Musk said on the earnings call that he sees global demand for the Model 3 to reach somewhere between 500,000 and a million cars per year. Tesla isn't quite there, yet. The company is only partly down the path to reach Musk's audacious goals and ambitions. But Musk says he has a plan to boost the production of its Model 3s to 10,000 cars per week sometime in 2019, and has aimed to deliver 500,000 cars in 2018 and 1 million cars by 2020. Musk also has said that he thinks Tesla could be a trillion-dollar company by 2025. Tesla isn't quite a wildly successful, profitable and mainstream company just yet. It still has massive debt. But Tesla isn't quite a wildly successful, profitable and mainstream company just yet. It still has massive debt: $7.25 billion in recourse debt and $3.25 billion in non-recource debt — and could raise more money down the road. Tesla isn't quite a wildly successful, profitable and mainstream company just yet. It still has massive debt.Musk said on the earnings call that Tesla doesn't expect to raise any more money to fund projects, but most analysts think that likely still will happen. But with a couple profitable quarters under Tesla's belt, fundraising could be a lot easier. The Model 3 is also still not a low-cost car. While the company long has intended to sell it for $35,000, the current Model 3s come with bells and whistles that boost them to closer to $50,000. Tesla can't yet make the car, sell it for $35,000 and sustain its business. Musk said on the earnings call that if Tesla could produce the $35,000 Model 3 today, "We’d do it. That’s our mission."View the discussion thread.Get your copySummer Rates Now Available

Body: Elon Musks Tesla trotsar börsfrossan. Foto: Paul Sancya/AP. Erik WisterbergReporterErik WisterbergReporterBörsfrossan tycks fortsätta. De nordiska börserna backade ordentligt på tisdagen efter stora nedgångar i dagens asiatiska handel, vilket spred sig till hela Europa.Även i New York startade börsdagen i moll. De ledande New York-börserna inledde med breda nedgångar under tisdagens första handelstimmar.Men en aktie gick som en raket. Elon Musks elbilsbolag Tesla var vid klockan 19.00, svensk tid, på tisdagskvällen upp hela 10 procent.Teslas kvartalsrapport släpps på onsdagen. Nyhetsbyrån Direkt rapporterar att Citron Research, som tidigare varit negativt inställd till Tesla, har bytt fot inför onsdagens kvartalsrapport. Analyshuset menar bland annat att Model 3 "bevisligen har blivit en succé".Citron Research har länge spekulerat i en nedgång i Teslas aktie, så kallad blankning. Man har också varit skarpt kritisk mot vd:n Elon Musk – och stämde nyligen Tesla för Musks twittrande om sina planer på att köpa ut bolaget från börsen. I den nya analysen, som avslöjar att Citron Research gått från en kort till en lång position i Tesla, konstaterar firman att Musks beteende har överskuggat viktigare saker. "Medan alla fokuserar på att Elon Musk röker gräs, så eldar han i tysthet upp hela bilindustrin", skriver Citron Research enligt Reuters.Breakit berättade nyligen om ett smått historiskt skifte. Tesla säljer nu säljer mer bilar i USA än bilens uppfinnare."Tesla tar inte bara kunder från BMW och Mercedes, utan även från Toyota och Honda", konstaterar Citron Research.Vid 21:30 tiden på tisdagskvällen hade Teslas aktiekurs gått upp med 12 procent. erik@breakit.se På breakit.se sparar vi information om ditt besök i kakor.

Title: Teslas Elon Musk slår tillbaka mot FBI – med en dikt | SvD
Author: Anonymous
Body: SvD.ads.splashLinkText('Elon Musk slår tillbaka mot FBI – med en dikt'); Artikel Elon Musk slår tillbaka mot FBI – med en dikt Här är Teslas tuffa argument mot FBI: Vi har inte fått en officiell stämning än. Elbilsföretaget som visade vinstprognos i veckan nagelfars nu av FBI som undersöker om de mörkat produktionsprognoser om den viktiga Tesla Model 3. Nyheterna smattrar som störtskurar runt elbilstillverkaren Tesla. På fredagen, bara två dagar efter att vd Elon Musk presenterat bolagets andra kvartalsvinstrapport genom tiderna, kom ett nytt nyhetspiller. Nu ett beskt sådant. Ett av många i dramat kring Tesla och dess kontroversielle storägare Elon Musk. Utifrån anonyma källor rapporterade Wall Street Journal att amerikanska FBI undersöker om Tesla vilselett marknaden med information om produktionen av nya mellanklass-elbilen Model 3.Model 3 är Teslas första massmarknadsbil och därigenom den bärande balken i hela Teslas bolagsbygge och möjligheten till vinst. Elon Musks mål att nå Model 3:s produktionstakt på 5000 bilar i veckan fördröjdes ett halvår på grund av olika produktionsproblem. Musk har själv kallat produktionsupptakten som hans bolag just nu står och väger med för ”production hell” – produktionshelvetet. FBI-artikeln i Wall Street Journal pumpades genast upp till världsnyhet. Enligt den ska FBI även försökt snärja ett nät runt Musk genom att locka avhoppade Tesla-medarbetare att prata. Sent på fredagskvällen, bara några timmar efter artikeln publicerades svarade Tesla med ett skriftligt meddelande – via mejl. Man medgav att man tagit emot en frivillig begäran av dokument från amerikanska justitiedepartementet tidigare i år om produktionsprognoser för Model 3. Dessa ska också ha skickats in. Men mejlets huvudbudskap som dunkades in var att Tesla varken mottagit en formell stämning eller begäran om vittnesmål från det amerikanska justitiedepartementet. Det poängterades att man de senaste månaderna överhuvudtaget inte haft någon korrespondens. Tesla svarade alltså via mejl. Vd:n Elon Musk har tidigare själv, i likhet med president Donald Trump, gärna svarat på kritik via Twitter på ett offensivt sätt, men tvingats sluta sedan amerikanska finansinspektionen i månadsskiftet september/oktober bötfällde honom 20 miljoner dollar i en uppgörelse där han också tappade ordförandeposten.Samma dag som Wall Street Journals artikel publicerades twittrade Elon Musk dikten ”Fire and Ice” av Robert Frost, som handlar om jordens undergång.Fire and Ice https://t.co/ulgSZ1wlPlTesla har tidigare denna månad blivit stämda av aktieägare i en grupptalan för just osanna utfästelser om Model 3-produktionen i ett pågående mål. Som noterat börsbolag är det lätt att följa Elon Musks officiella utfästelser om Model 3-produktionen: I augusti 2017 sa han att man skulle nå 1 500 Model 3 under tredje kvartalet och en takt på 5000 bilar per vecka – vilket allmänt ansetts som en långsiktigt lönsam nivå – i slutet av 2017. Men den takten nåddes alltså inte förrän i juni 2018. Ungefär samtidigt provkörde SvD som första svenska tidning Model 3 på plats i USA. Själva bilen fick gott betyg och bilen har också seglat upp i försäljningslistorna och blev i september USA:s femte mest sålda sedanmodell efter Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic och Honda Accord. Elon Musk spådde, när onsdagens kvartalsrapport presenterades, fortsatt positivt kassaflöde och vinst även resten av året. Många analytiker pekar dock på att Tesla, för detta, måste visa att produktionstaken är långsiktigt hållbar. Tesla-aktien föll strax efter att nyheten publicerades men repade sig och gick upp 5,1 procent innan fredagens stängning.Bilbranschen går igenom ett historiskt skifte mot elbilar, självkörande fordon och nya sätt att se på mobilitet. Men framtiden för bilindustrin är mer osäker än någonsin. Det är en viktig fond när man ser på Teslas aktiekurs sedan årsskiftet. Aktien har gått upp 3,2 procent medan de stora traditionella bilbolagens aktiekurser närmast slaktats under samma period: Vid fredagens stängning var General Motors ner 21,8 procent, Daimler 27,2 procent och Ford hela 29 procent.

Senare i kväll lämnar elbilstillverkaren rapport för det viktiga tredje kvartalet, där grundaren Elon Musk lovat att bolaget ska börja tjäna pengar. Robert Triches Publicerad: 24 oktober 2018, 19:32 Uppdaterad: 24 oktober 2018, 20:21 I rankningen rasar Tesla sex placeringar och landar på tredjeplatsen från botten av 29 jämförda varumärken. Företagets nyaste modell, Model 3, behåller sitt medelbetyg men trotjänaren Model S får samtidigt sänkt rekommendation på grund av inrapporterade problem med alltifrån dörrhandtagen till luftfjädringen, skriver Wall Street Journal. Teslas SUV Model X, presterade också dåligt – de facto bland de allra sämsta i klassen av totalt 300 undersökta bilmodeller.Tesla har kommenterat rankningen och konstaterar att företagets bilar tidigare skattats högt av tidningens läsare."Våra bilar är inte bara de säkraste och bäst presterande fordon som finns på marknaden i dag, vi tar också återkoppling från våra kunder mycket seriöst och implementerar förbättringar i snabb takt", säger en talesperson för företaget.Marknaden tog av allt att döma lätt på Consumer Reports lista inför kvällens rapport och handlade upp Teslas aktie på förmiddagen. Utvecklingen vände emellertid i eftermiddagshandeln och aktien låg vid 20.20-tiden svensk tid på minus 0,7 procent. Vid samma tid är S&P500 ner 1,4 procent.Även Ford, GM och Fiat Chryslers modeller bedöms ha lägre tillförlitlighet i årets rankning, skriver WSJ.

Body: Efter det senaste årets många negativa artiklar kan Tesla redovisa en vinst för första gången sedan starten 2003 och vi talar inte om småpengar.Den amerikanska elbilstillverkaren har kontinuerligt visat upp förlustsiffror i sina delårsrapporter så det var nog en hel del analytiker och självutnämnda Tesla-kritiker som satte morgonkaffet i vrångstrupen igår morse när Teslas senaste kvartalsrapport visade en vinst på drygt 2,8 miljarder kronor. Detta överraskande positiva besked medförde att Teslas aktie steg kraftigt i efterhandeln och var ett tag uppe på +13% igår kväll men har fallit tillbaka något och är i skrivande stund upp drygt 9%.Omsättning uppgick till 6,82 miljarder dollar, att jämföra med finansinstitutet Bloombergs prognos på 6,31. Kassaflödet var också betydligt högre än vad man uppskattat på förhand. I stället för det förväntade 280 miljarder dollar landade det på 881. Det är ett kraftigt lyft från förra kvartalsrapporten då Tesla redovisade en förlust på 717,5 miljoner dollar på grund av höga utvecklingskostnader och produktionsproblem som var kopplade till Model 3.Men nu tillskrivs alltså det positiva resultatet den stora efterfrågan på Model 3, den kraftigt ökade produktionstakten som nu är uppe i över 5.300 enheter per vecka (målet är 6.000) och att endast 20% av de förbeställda 455.000 bilarna har avbokats på grund av den förlängda väntetiden som de tidigare produktionsproblemen medfört. Dessutom har bruttomarginalen på Model 3 ökat till 20%, något som Teslas VD, Elon Musk, tidigare sagt var målet för fjärde kvartalet. Amerikanska analytiker är dock fortfarande en aning försiktiga med att ge Tesla aktien köprekommendationer eftersom man gärna vill se en ökad efterfrågan och produktionsvolym, något som den nyligen aviserade budgetmodellen av Model 3 mycket väl kan medföra. Dessutom planerar Tesla för ytterligare en ny modell med beteckningen Model Y som kan komma att kräva nya investeringar som kan dra ner framtida resultat.Dagens PS är den optimala nyhetssajten för dig som älskar det bästa av det mesta med tyngdpunkt på business och entreprenörskap.Chefredaktör: John Uggla | VD & Ansvarig utgivare: Mikael Gullström | Dagens PS, Regeringsgatan 67, 111 56 STOCKHOLM

Body: "Ett historiskt kvartal", enligt Elon Musk. Av Erik Söderholm, Publicerad 2018-10-25 08:32, uppdaterad 2018-10-25 12:32 Bilindustri Bilindustri Under onsdagkvällen svensk tid presenterade Tesla en kvartalsrapport som bjöd på en glad nyhet för Elon Musk: bolaget visade vinst och överträffade marknadens och analytikernas förväntningar.Teslas omsättning blev 6,8 miljarder dollar, vilket är nytt rekord. Vinsten blev 312 miljoner dollar eller 1,75 dollar per aktie.Det här är första gången på två år som Tesla rapporterar vinst. Elon Musk kallar det för ett "historiskt kvartal".Det är framför allt suget efter "folkelbilen" Model 3 som lyfter Tesla. Hittills har Tesla fått in förskottsbetalning på 455.000 Model 3. Elon Musk har haft stora problem att få upp produktionstakten för Model 3, men nu verkar tillverkningen rulla på bra med 5.300 bilar per vecka. Målet ligger på 6.000 bilar per vecka.Tesla rapporterar också att tillverkningstiden för Model 3 har sjunkit med 30 procent."Det här är en vattendelare. De har radikalt ändrat köpbeteendet på bilmarknaden", säger Salim Morsy, analytiker på Bloomberg.Missa ingenting! Prenumerera på vårt nyhetsbrev. Missa ingenting! Prenumerera på vårt nyhetsbrev.

Title: Tesla Releases Autopilot Drive on Navigation in North America 
Author: Anonymous
Body: Elon Musk announced that Tesla is releasing Autopilot Drive on Navigation in North America tonight. The evening of October 27 is going to be known in the automotive history books as the day Tesla enabled Navigate on Autopilot on its electric vehicles. Inspiration Elon Musk: The Story of a Maverick Elon Musk announced early this morning that Tesla is releasing Autopilot Drive on Navigation in North America tonight.Navigate on Autopilot makes Tesla vehicles smarter, safer, and more intuitive. The update also introduces a refined and simplified user interface and a wide variety of new features for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 as well as on Tesla's mobile application. Tesla cars now put autonomous driving further into a future where driving is cleaner, greener, and safer above all. Earlier this month, Tesla rolled out its 9.0 software to its vehicles. However, an important feature was held back for some additional testing: Navigate on Autopilot. Previously in August, Elon Musk announced that they were enabling full self-driving features during that month, giving more control over to the car from highway on-ramp to off-ramp. With Navigate on Autopilot released tonight on Tesla's Software Version 9.0, the company is expanding the existing suite of Autopilot features. Tesla has been releasing such features as over-the-air updates including all-new functionality. Navigate on Autopilot is an active guidance feauture that guides a car from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp with the driver's supervision. Navigate on Autopilot suggests lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and also taking exits. Autopilot is designed to help the driver find and follow the most efficient path toward their destination when the feature is in use. After the driver enters the destination into the navigation, they can choose to enable Navigate on Autopilot for that trip. The feauture is activated when Autosteer is engaged via the normal prompt on the cruise control stalk on Model S and Model X, or gear selector stalk on Model 3. When Autopilot suggests a lane change, the driver must confirm this tapping the turn signal, for Model S and Model X, the turn signal or cruise control stalk. Drivers are always in control accepting or denying suggestions. The driver can continue to use Autosteer and other Enhanced Autopilot features without Navigate on Autopilot anytime they want. In August, Tesla initially released Navigate on Autopilot in Shadow Mode, a dormant logging-only mode that allowed the company to validate the performance of the feature in the background.Today, Tesla is releasing Navigate on Autopilot in Beta to Tesla customers in the United States. Tesla is currently waiting for pending validation and regulatory approval from other markets, after which Navigate on Autopilot is also going to reach Tesla customers in the rest of the world. Navigate on Autopilot makes Tesla vehicles smarter, safer, and more intuitive. The update also introduces a refined and simplified user interface and a wide variety of new features for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 as well as on Tesla's mobile application. Connect your Tesla to WiFi and drive on!

Tesla officially released the Version 9 update earlier this month, which included a new dash cam feature, games that can be played while the car is parked, and updates to the vehicle’s navigation settings, and indicated that Navigate would be following shortly thereafter. In a blog post, Tesla says that with driver supervision, cars equipped with the feature will be able guide “a car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and taking exits.” This isn’t fully autonomous driving: drivers will need to approve lane changes by using the stalk, although Tesla notes that they’ll be able to waive this in future updates. Tesla also says that drivers will still need to pay attention to the road, and characterizes this as “an additional layer of safety that two eyes alone would not have.” Tesla also released a short video that demonstrates how to use the feature, showing off how to activate the feature and how to approve lane-changes and merging on the highway. The system uses an array of cameras, radar, and sensors to determine what objects are surrounding the vehicle, and uses this information to help the vehicle navigate, all while sending data back to the company’s vision and neural net system, allowing it to improve its software. Tesla says that since Autopilot was launched in 2015, it’s collected more than a billion miles worth of data. But there have been concerns — Autopilot was apparently responsible for a navigational error that resulted in a fatal crash, and the company settled a class action lawsuit over delays to the system back in May. Tesla also recently stopped promoting the “Full Self-Driving” option for its cars, saying that it was taking the option off temporarily because it was causing too much confusion. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

Title: The latest software update pushes Tesla cars closer to full self-driving mode | TechRadar
Author: David Nield
Body: Tesla is pushing out a major update for its vehicles: called Navigate on Autopilot, it gives Tesla cars the ability to drive themselves from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, with human supervision – so you can't fall asleep at the wheel just yet.The upgrade follows on from the Version 9 software that rolled out earlier this month. It means the self-driving car will be able to suggest lane changes and take them itself, navigate to the correct exit, and of course maintain a safe distance away from other cars (something Teslas have been able to do for a while now).body .hawk-widget{--trd-blue:#2f6e91;width:100%;letter-spacing:normal;}._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:16px 0;}@media (min-width:600px){._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{margin:0;min-height:128px;float:right;clear:none;width:50%;}.fancy_box_body ._hawk.subtitle~.hawk-widget[data-widget-type=price]{float:none;width:100%;}}.icon~.hawk-widget{clear:both;}"While initially the feature will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn stalk before the car moves into an adjacent lane, future versions of Navigate on Autopilot will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement," Tesla says.There's also a word of warning in the blog post announcing the software update: "Until truly driverless cars are validated and approved by regulators, drivers are responsible for and must remain in control of their car at all times."One of the ongoing challenges of self-driving cars is that humans seem a little too willing to pass responsibility over to their vehicle and allow themselves to be distracted by something else – Teslas are some of the most advanced autonomous motors around, but drivers still need to be watching the road, or the consequences can be fatal.Tesla says its cars can now make two types of lane changes: to keep you on your programmed route or to keep you closest to your programmed cruising speed. You'll be able to set your speed preferences from the dashboard.Via TechCrunch

Title: Tesla's 'Navigate on Autopilot' goes live in North America tonight
Author: Anonymous
Body: When Tesla rolled out its 9.0 software to vehicles earlier this month, it held back one feature for some additional testing: Navigate on Autopilot. Now, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that a beta test of the feature will become widely available across North America tonight. In a move that Musk has previously described as a time when "we will begin to enable full self-driving features," it gives more control over to the car from highway on-ramp to off-ramp.As described by Tesla:Our most advanced Autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot is an active guidance feature that, with driver supervision, guides a car from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, navigating highway interchanges and taking exits. It's designed to make finding and following the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the highway when Autopilot is in use.The driver is still supervising, and will need to confirm before the car changes lanes, but overall it could mean requiring much less interaction on these closed-access highways. Despite controversy as a result of crashes and occasional complaints, Musk said that until now Autopilot has focused on increasing safety. Even though the "full self-driving" option may be gone from Tesla's website, it's clearly still a goal for the company.Update: Tesla has published a blog post that explains the feature further, how to use it and includes a video showing how to engage it. Drivers will need to enable the feature in their Autopilot menu, and it has four settings for speed based lane changes (Disabled, Mild, Average, or Mad Max) and will prompt to change lanes either to keep the car on its route, or to stay closer to its target speed.According to Tesla, "future versions of Navigate on Autopilot will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to," and its future AI chip will enable full self-driving capability on the platform. In another tweet, Musk predicted that waiving the confirmation for a lane change could arrive once "safety looks good" after about 10 million miles of driving with the feature.Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonightRichard's been tech-obsessed since first laying hands on an Atari joystick.

Title: Tesla rolls out Autopilot update for highway travel
Author: Anonymous
Body: Nick Lavars3 picturesTesla calls Navigate with Autopilot its most advanced Autopilot feature ever(Credit: Tesla)Tesla has edged a little bit closer to its vision of a fully autonomous driving future, introducing a new feature for the latest version of its Autopilot software designed to handle the bulk of highway travel. Dubbed Navigate with Autopilot, the new functionality is part of Version 9 of Tesla's Autopilot software that was released in early October. This also saw the addition of Atari games to the touchscreen (only when the car is parked), along with other features like a dash cam mode that collects 10-minute clips from the car's front-facing camera.The company calls Navigate with Autopilot its most advanced Autopilot feature ever and is part of an upgrade to its driver-assistance technology. Available to Tesla owners with the Enhanced Autopilot platform, the upgrade is built to guide the vehicle from the on-ramp of a highway to the off-ramp, albeit under driver supervision (for now).With the feature engaged, the car will suggest lane changes, navigate interchanges and take the correct exit. In its current form, it will change lanes automatically, though only after the driver okays it with a tug of the turn stalk to show they are paying attention. Tesla says there are two kinds of lane changes that the software will suggest, one designed to keep the car as close to its navigation route as possible, and the other designed to keep the vehicle as close to its target speed as possible. The sensitivity of these speed-based lane-change suggestions can be configured through different settings, with "Mild" suggesting a change when traveling significantly below the target speed, and "Mad Max" making a case for a lane change even when traveling just below it. Tesla says with further development, Navigate on Autopilot will allow owners to disable the confirmation requirement, enabling the car to change lanes where it sees fit. CEO Elon Musk expanded on this on Twitter, stating that "when safety looks good after 10 million miles (16 million km) of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."This isn't a great deal of data in the grand scheme of things. Since Autopilot launched in 2015, Tesla's onboard sensors, radars and cameras have been used to collect more than one billion miles of real-world driving data, which is all part of its plan to realize a fully self-driving future. Tesla has made the autonomous features of its vehicles a key selling point, and this has raised concerns that customers may be misled and place disproportionate reliance on the software. The term Autopilot itself is seen by some as misleading, including the European New Car Assessment Program which recently stated "system name, Autopilot, does not clearly indicate that this is an Assist System and could give a wrong impression about the system capabilities."By his own admission, Musk acknowledged the murkiness of these descriptors when admitting the "Full Self Driving Option" had been pulled from Tesla's vehicle order page in mid-October, conceding it "was causing too much confusion." This was understandably met with some backlash from customers who had forked out US$5,000 and waited years for the feature, with its future now uncertain.Only a checkbox for "Enhanced Autopilot" now features on Tesla's order page. When or if the Full Self-Driving Option returns, and in what form, remains to be seen. For what it's worth, Tesla asks that its drivers "always be attentive when using Autopilot."You can see the new Navigate on Autopilot software demonstrated in the video below.Source: Tesla With Navigate with Autopilot engaged, the Tesla will suggest lane changes, navigate interchanges and take the correct exit (Credit: Tesla) Tesla calls Navigate with Autopilot its most advanced Autopilot feature ever (Credit: Tesla) Tesla's Navigate with Autopilot will see the vehicle change lanes automatically, though only after the driver okays it with a tug of the turn stalk to ensure they are paying attention (Credit: Tesla) TagsShare this articleSee the stories that matter in your inbox every morningSee the stories that matter in your inbox every morningCopyright © Gizmag Pty Ltd 2019

Title: How Tesla Could Dominate The Auto Industry
Author: Anonymous
Body: A Tesla Model 3 automobile is on display. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)One of the stronger arguments Tesla bears have put forward is that they expect major car makers like Ford, Mercedes, Honda and Toyota to eventually release a "Tesla-killer." Gorden Lam, one of my managers, doesn't see this happening anytime soon. There are good reasons why Tesla has no real competitors at this time. If one does not emerge soon, Tesla looks poised to dominate the auto industry in a few years.Where's The Competition?Five years ago, Citron Research shorted Tesla because they foresaw that:By the time this (Tesla's) product is even approaching market, there will be multiple other 200-mile range plug-ins that have been out for years.Earlier this week, when Citron reversed their short position, they said it was because "Tesla is destroying the competition". But what is the competition? Is it electric cars? Is it luxury cars? Is it all cars?From the quote above, it seems that five years ago Citron thought the competition would come from other 200-mile range plug-ins. However, based on recent reports, it is clear that Tesla is attracting customers in the entire luxury car market, not just the all-electric luxury car market.This bodes well for Tesla's future, not so much for companies that make cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE).As Tesla's production ramps up and fixed costs are divided among more cars, it will become possible for Tesla to make a profit on lower priced cars that can compete with ICE cars across the board.On Wednesday's earnings call, Elon Musk said Tesla could increase production from 5,000 to 7,000 cars/week without much capex spending. Think about that! Tesla can make 40% more cars without increasing their fixed costs by much.Musk did not say this, but I think it means the fixed costs per car are about to drop by about 40%. When that happens, I think Tesla will be able to compete profitably for mainstream car buyers.How Will Competitors React?Like Citron Research, I am surprised at how ineffective the leading car companies have been in developing a "Tesla-killer."Rather than compete with Tesla, Ford seems to be running away. In April, Ford announced they were dropping traditional cars from their product line to focus on crossovers and SUVs. This strategy makes sense from an accountant's point of view as these are Ford's most profitable products.However, since there is no reason Tesla could not make an SUV, Ford's decision to focus on their high-margin products only protects them competing with Tesla for the time being.Mercedes and Volvo have shown concept cars which basically means they are years away from production.GM is currently selling the Chevy Bolt, which on paper looks like a competitor. However, Gorden Lam points out that sales of the Bolt plunged 40% in September while Tesla's Model 3 was the fifth best selling car. The customers have spoken. Honestly take a look at both cars. Which one you would rather own?The Award-winning Chevy Bolt EV is presented during the four-day auto trade show AutoMobility. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)It's almost as if GM doesn't want to sell too many Bolts. This would make sense if the Bolt is a money-loser and GM only sells it to get ZEV credits.I don't know what GM is thinking, but the Bolt is not a Tesla-killer.The Clock Is TickingIf it turns out customers prefer to fuel their cars with $1/day of electricity instead of $50/week of gasoline, the current auto industry leaders are woefully unprepared.In order to compete, they will have to overcome two big hurdles.First, they need to find a source of batteries for their cars that are competitive with the ones Tesla makes. Musk said in the last call that Tesla batteries have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. This could be hyperbole, but the fact is that a competitor would have to match Tesla's cost per kilowatt hour or cede a big advantage to Tesla.Second, they need to provide customers a way to charge their cars on long trips. Otherwise, customers will need a second car for long trips.One reason you don't see the big car companies taking steps to compete effectively with Tesla is because doing so will cannibalize their existing business.It takes a strong leader to convince everyone with a stake in the company to make major investments to compete in a business in which you don't have an advantage and which will cannibalize your existing profits.I don't think the CEOs of the other car companies are able to take this step. Musk was able to do it because Tesla didn't have ICE car profits to cannibalize.We've Seen This BeforeWhen Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 a lot of investors thought Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry and Sony Ericsson would make short work of Apple.In time, the leaders of the mobile phone industry have almost completely changed. The process took years to unfold, and generated a lot of wealth for those who saw it coming early on.The situation is repeating itself with Tesla right now. There are lots of people betting that today's auto industry leaders will eventually put down the threat posed by Tesla. They have the resources to do it but they are certainly not moving very fast. Until we see a serious competitor to the Model 3 come to market, I'm betting on Tesla.If you would like to be notified when Gorden Lam updates his views, click here.If you would like to be notified when I write about Tesla or other stocks you and I are both following, click here.I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC.

Title: Elon Musk's Twitter meltdowns are symptoms of a much bigger problem for Tesla
Author: Anonymous
Body: © 2019 NBC NEWS.COMElon Musk has had a rough year. The Tesla CEO has been dogged by a seemingly unending list of setbacks. There were leaks showing how the company was covering up its high rates of worker injuries, a fatal accident involving its Autopilot driver-assist system, fires in the paint shop and a catastrophic failure of Musk’s plan to automate final assembly of Tesla vehicles — an intricate process which robots can’t easily perform. And that’s to say nothing of the headlines generated by Musk’s unfiltered and combative tweets, including one in which he accused a diver who aided the Thailand cave rescue of being a pedophile.Then on Aug. 7, in an attempt to reduce the mounting pressure from both investors and critics, Musk tweeted that he was taking Tesla private at $420 per share — a significant premium on the market price — without first consulting his board or notifying shareholders. “Funding secured,” he assured his followers via his social media account. This promise, like so many others, was a lie. But unlike in the past, it would have consequences.Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Musk has benefited immensely from a myth of unique brilliance that the tech press and business media, in particular, helped him build. This myth has long shielded him from true scrutiny but is unraveling as Tesla’s problems and Musk’s unhinged tweets have forced a more critical assessment of his actions. Yet as much as he tries to direct the blame at others, his narcissism makes him unable to accept the inconvenient truth that the responsibility is ultimately his own.Musk has benefited immensely from a myth of unique brilliance that the tech press and business media, in particular, helped him build.Let’s first take a look at why Musk’s financing tweet was such a big deal. In the days following his declaration, it became clear that he was hoping for Saudi money to fund his plan; but the Saudis put $1 billion into Lucid Motors instead. To make matters worse, Azaelia Banks, who claimed she was at Musk’s mansion in early August to record music with his musician girlfriend Grimes, alleged that Musk was franticly calling potential investors to secure funding after sending the tweet.Since Tesla was and remains a public company, these actions were illegal, leading the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an investigation that recently came to a close — but not without more antics on Musk’s part.On Sept. 27, the SEC sued Musk for securities fraud for making “false and misleading” statements to investors and sought to bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. But it didn’t have to get to that point.Musk had negotiated a settlement with the SEC where he would have paid $10 million and resigned as chairman for two years, but he was incensed that it would require him not to admit guilt or innocence. He wanted to declare he hadn’t done anything wrong, so he told his board he would resign unless they publicly supported him and backed his decision to reject the settlement. They promptly agreed.However, when the stock crashed after the lawsuit was filed, Musk sent his lawyers back to the SEC to negotiate a new settlement. This time he was required to pay $20 million, along with a matching $20 million from Tesla; resign as chairman for three years; and the company would have to add two independent directors and a lawyer to review Musk’s communications — including his tweets. Talk about a great dealmaker.But for anyone who’s been following the billionaire, this didn’t come as a surprise.Faced with critical assessment instead of blind praise, Musk now claims that the media has been bought off by traditional auto and fossil fuel companies looking to smear him.For much of the past decade, Musk has been plastered across magazine covers; praised as a visionary whose ideas were remaking the world. Yet, faced with critical assessment instead of blind praise, Musk now claims that the media has been bought off by traditional auto and fossil fuel companies looking to smear him. He even floated the idea of starting a website to rate journalists on their “credibility.”But the media isn’t Musk’s only enemy. His Twitter account has become the site of a conspiracy parroted on supportive blogs and forums that “short sellers” — investors which make money by betting that a stock price will decline — are behind Tesla’s negative media coverage and are trying to bring the company down to make a profit. After settling with the SEC, Musk called the institution the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission,” showing the company needs to hurry up and hire his tweet monitor.Musk has been consumed by his narcissism to a degree that any criticism, no matter how reasonable, is an attack on the very core of his being; a fact which has become ever clearer as his addiction to Twitter — and who knows what else — has gotten worse. This week Musk said Twitter had briefly locked down his account because his tweets seemed suspicious. In fact, it was just Musk being Musk.Wanna buy some Bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/9ZbBJ5fuVqBut Bitcoin and Japanese anime are the least of Musk's social media worries. After being called out for getting involved in the Thai cave rescue for good press, Musk lashed out at the British diver who helped lead the successful mission, branding him a “pedo” — slang for pedophile. He issued a half-hearted apology before doubling down on the accusation and asking why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue. What Musk didn’t realize was that he was being sued — the diver’s lawyer had already sent the notice.So what caused Musk to take to Twitter with such erratic outbursts? Banks claimed Musk was on acid when he sent the infamous tweet, and Musk himself admitted that the $420 share price was a reference to cannabis culture. In an interview with the New York Times, Musk denied that he smoked marijuana: “There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.”Yet, in September, when Musk took a puff of a joint on Joe Rogan’s podcast, claiming he’d only tried it once, his demeanor didn’t inspire confidence. He came off twitchy and awkward and later came under fire for smoking marijuana when Tesla’s workers are drug tested and could be fired for doing the same.What is clear is that the pressure from running Tesla is getting to him, but that pressure doesn’t originate with investors, customers, or short sellers; it’s generated by Musk himself.Musk sets the expectations that customers and investors judge him by, but his timelines are notoriously overoptimistic. Tesla Model 3 production was supposed to hit 5,000 cars per week by the end of 2017; that number wasn’t hit until June 2018, and production fell off again soon after.Tesla has also been selling a “full self-driving” package for two years, even though the cars don’t have such capabilities and they don't seem to be coming anytime soon — the option was pulled from Tesla’s website in mid-October. Most recently, Musk promised “full self-driving” features would be delivered in August 2018 — they weren’t — and a planned coast-to-coast self-driving trip was set for the end of 2017, then mid-2018 and now who knows when it will happen.In short, Musk never hits his timelines, but that doesn’t stop him from throwing out new ones that will likely suffer the same fate.Musk never hits his timelines, but that doesn’t stop him from throwing out new ones that will likely suffer the same fate.It doesn’t help that Tesla is currently in "logistics hell." The company can’t figure out how to get vehicles to customers all of a sudden — but don’t worry, Musk has a solution: building car carriers. Forget that the trucking industry says there’s plenty of capacity. Musk’s plan to bring repairs in-house is a similar mess that doesn’t address the real problem. Customers are angry because so many Model 3s are damaged on delivery or have issues soon after, yet third-party repair shops say they could do the repairs more quickly if only they could get the parts from Tesla in a timely manner.When you consider Musk and Tesla’s net worth, Musk got off easy with his SEC settlement. But it seems only a matter of time before Tesla starts to really suffer as a result of its mad genius CEO’s mismanagement. The SEC is reportedly still looking into Tesla’s production output over more potential false claims, while the Department of Justice is still investigating the $420 tweet — the SEC settled civil charges against Musk, but the DOJ could still bring criminal charges.Tesla may be holding on for now, but as its financial situation deteriorates, its leadership jumps ship, never-ending problems keep it from getting cars to customers and Musk’s tweets find the company in PR hot water more and more often, it remains to be seen how long the company can stay the course. Musk assures his followers that nothing bad is going to happen, but can anyone still trust his assurances?Paris Marx is a socialist writer and graduate student at McGill University in Montreal.

Title: Tesla delivers profit 'many' thought 'impossible,' CEO Elon Musk says
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla delivered a rare quarterly profit as the company ramped up production of its Model 3 electric car, inching closer to financial sustainability even as big-ticket spending items linger in the near future.Embattled CEO Elon Musk cited the performance Wednesday as proof that Tesla has achieved viability despite tremendous skepticism. Tesla shares jumped 8.2 percent in after-hours trading to $312.93 on Wednesday.The performance came during a tumultuous quarter for Musk, who agreed to give up his Tesla chairmanship as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC had sued Musk over his dubious Twitter claims that he had lined up a deal to take Tesla private.More: Elon Musk's SEC deal is a win for Tesla buyers, but could put a dent in his reputationMore: Consumer Reports: Tesla's reliability tumbles to near the bottom in latest surveyMore: Tesla CEO Elon Musk touts new Model 3, but it's a bit pricier than the one many expectedThe Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker reported net income of $312 million in the third quarter, a year after reporting a net loss of $619 million.The profit comes as Tesla racks up cash from sales of the Model 3 electric sedan, its most important vehicle yet because it is the first aimed at the mass, not luxury, market. While the ramp-up of manufacturing took longer than usual for a car company, the pace of production has improved along with Tesla's finances.Third-quarter total revenue soared from $2.98 billion a year ago to $6.82 billion."Sufficient Model 3 profitability was critical to make our business sustainable – something many argued would be impossible to achieve," Musk said in a letter to investors. To be sure, profitability may not last for long. The company is investing in a new plant in Shanghai to make electric cars for China and it is also expected to spend to deliver a new electric crossover called the Model Y within the next few years. Tesla has also outlined other costly ambitions, including production of an electric semi-truck and sports car.Musk said he "recently" approved the Model Y prototype to go into production with a goal of making the vehicle in high volumes in 2020.A more immediate question is whether Tesla will offer cheaper Model 3 versions soon and whether it can continue making money when it does. In the third quarter, Model 3 carried a starting price of $49,000.The company still intends to deliver the Model 3 at its originally promised starting price of $35,000. Musk said it could be ready as soon as February, but the company is not currently able to make the battery pack for it."We’re trying to provide as many affordable electric car options as we can," Musk said on a conference call.UBS analyst Colin Langan expressed skepticism that Tesla can maintain profitability when it begins selling cheaper Model 3 cars.But Tesla said it expects to continue wringing excess costs out of vehicle production. "While the average selling price will gradually decline as we introduce lower-priced variants, we are not expecting this to impact profitability," Musk wrote.The company sped up electric-vehicle production to 80,142 vehicles during the third quarter, including 53,239 Model 3 units.Overall, the total output marked a 50 percent increase from the second quarter, which was the company's previous high.Vehicle deliveries — what the rest of the auto industry would typically label as vehicle sales — totaled 83,500 for the quarter, including 55,840 Model 3 cars.In the "long term," Musk predicted that global demand for the Model 3 would hit 500,000 to 1 million cars annually. The company expects to begin European sales of the Model 3 in the first quarter of 2019 and Asia sales soon thereafter, Musk said. The car is currently sold only in North America.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

The analysis of 29 auto brands ranks Tesla as No. 27, one of the lowest-rated brands in this year's report. "While Tesla hasn't changed the Model S in terms of how it looks, it keeps changing the vehicle underneath, so the reliability fluctuates," said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.Fisher added that many Tesla owners reported a number of issues, especially with the vehicle's air suspension system.Tesla said the suspension issues for the Model S have been cut by 65 percent since last year. "The suspension issues that some Model S customers experienced primarily in 2017 were due to a supplier-related issue that did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked," the company said in a statement sent to CNBC. "The issue has already been addressed for customer vehicles in the field and resolved at the source with fundamental design improvements."While the reliability of the Model S has slipped in the eyes of Consumer Reports, it says the Model 3 has "average" reliability. "The lack of complexity in the Model 3 is why we thought it would have average reliability, and that's what our members have told us," said Fisher.The Consumer Reports annual auto reliability report is based on more than a half-million members of Consumer Reports reviewing their own vehicles. In essence, the owners report what's wrong with the cars, trucks and SUVs they drive every day.Overall, U.S. auto brands struggled in this report. Ford ranked the highest at No. 18, just ahead of General Motors' Buick, Ford's Lincoln and Fiat Chrysler's Dodge.Consumer Reports says the biggest issues with domestic cars and trucks are advanced transmissions, turbocharged engines and infotainment systems.By comparison, owners of foreign-brand vehicles reported fewer problems. Lexus, Toyota and Mazda were ranked as the most reliable.Fisher says the Japanese models benefit from management teams that are hesitant to make too many changes to their vehicles too quickly. "Toyota and Lexus are taking a more conservative approach to adding changes to their models, and as a result, those models have fewer issues," said Fisher.Got a confidential news tip?

            Most reliable cars: Tesla Model S plunges in Consumer Reports ranking - CBS News
    
Author: Anonymous
Body: Watch CBSN Live By Jerry Edgerton October 24, 2018 / 1:31 PM / MoneyWatch Along with Elon Musk's botched plan this summer to take Tesla private, the electric car maker now has dropped to near the bottom of Consumer Reports' influential reliability ratings. Other U.S. automakers also fared poorly, all scoring in the bottom half of the 29 brands assessed in the annual ranking, which the magazine released Wednesday. The Tesla Model S, which Consumer Reports' test drivers have praised for its performance, received a "below average" reliability rating. Its overall rating dropped it off the publication's "recommended" list. Model S owners reported suspension and other problems. Tesla ranked No. 27 in reliability, down six spots. That drop likely results from mechanical and software changes introduced in the last few model years, according to Jake Fisher, CR director of auto testing. "Just as we've seen with many other manufacturers, major changes and updates can cause reliability to slide," he said. "It can take a year or two for car makers to work out the kinks with new technology."A Tesla spokeswoman told the magazine that some Model S owners experienced suspension problems, but mostly in 2017, noting that the issue was related to a supplier."Suspension issues for Model S have improved 65 percent since last year," she said, "and we continue to make further improvements."Lexus and corporate sibling Toyota ranked as the two most reliable auto brands, as they have for six years in a row. Mazda, Subaru and Kia rounded out the top five, followed by Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai. Volvo ranked dead last. Consumer Reports said the poor rating is largely due to a problematic infotainment system that is included in models such as the XC60, XC90 and S90. The annual survey collected data on repair problems from Consumer Report subscribers that together owned or leased more than 500,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2018. Here is a closer look at how Detroit-based brands did in the reliability rankings: For many car shoppers, Consumer Reports' reliability testing amounts to a starting point in buying a vehicle. "Time and again, our consumers tell us that reliability is what matters most when it comes to choosing a vehicle," said Marta Tellado, CEO of Consumer Reports. It remains to be seen whether the low reliability score will affect Tesla sales. The company's Model 3, a lower-priced model that Tesla hopes will help it go mainstream, has quickly become one of the nation's best-selling sedans. In September, Tesla delivered more Model 3s than all but four Japanese sedans -- Toyota Corolla and Camry and Honda Civic and Accord.

Title: Tesla reliability falls in Consumer Reports survey
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla may be riding high when it comes to wowing luxury car buyers, but it has fallen to near bottom of the pack when it comes to Consumer Reports magazine's latest auto reliability survey rankings.The electric-car maker came in third from the bottom, tied with Cadillac, in the rankings of 29 brands in the survey released Wednesday. The only brand worse than Tesla and Cadillac was Volvo. Tesla fell six places from last year's survey.The best auto brand in the survey was Lexus, followed by Toyota and Mazda, which moved up nine places. Seven of the top 10 brands come from Japan or South Korea.By contrast, Detroit automakers fared poorly. The highest-ranking American brand, Ford, doesn't show up until 18th place. It was followed by Buick, Lincoln, Dodge, Jeep, Chevrolet, Chrysler, GMC and Ram before it comes to Tesla."The domestics are suffering from a few new products," said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing. He said reliability of some General Motors' redesigns "have taken a tumble," Ford continues to have issues with its latest in-car connectivity system and Fiat Chrysler "remains at the bottom of the list."Cadillacs, for instance, "drive so well" and can "go toe-to-toe" with the imports but suffer from reliability issues, he said. Cadillac was down a single place from the year before in the survey.Consumer Reports' ratings are among the most closely watched because the publication is notoriously independent. Its reliability ratings are based on what readers say about the vehicles they have bought. When brands fare poorly, it is often because automakers haven't worked the bugs out of otherwise solid new models they have introduced.Tesla, however, was brought down by a poor showing by the Model S luxury sedan, which has been on the market for about six years, said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for the magazine.New features that were added such as air suspension brought down its rating."The truth is the Model S is not an aging model. It's constantly being redesigned under the skin," Fisher said. Tesla, because of its ability to make changes in its models using over-the-air software updates in many cases, experiences "these growing pains differently than traditional car companies."Tesla said in a statement that the suspension issue was due to a supplier issue and has been resolved. It "did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked."More: Tesla CEO Elon Musk touts new Model 3, but it's a bit pricier than the one many expectedMore: Dyson vacuum cleaner company to build electric vehicle factory in SingaporeWhile owners may ding the electric cars on reliability, Tesla, in its statement, pointed out that the same model has been tops among owners in overall satisfaction in a survey by Consumer Reports.“Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues," the statement said. "That’s just one of the reasons why Model S has been ranked number one on Consumer Reports’ owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013, which was the first year Tesla was included in their report."The Model X crossover is worse for problems, Fisher said, but the brand's newest Model 3 car – its first aimed at the middle of the car market – was rated average.Generally, car brands fare worse for reliability when they introduce complex new technology or complicated systems. That was the case with the worst-showing from Volvo, Fisher said.A Volvo spokesman, Russell Datz, said he could not comment until he has seen the full report.How brands fared and their average reliability score: 1. Lexus 782. Toyota 763. Mazda 694. Subaru 655. Kia 61 (tie)6. Infiniti 61 (tie)7. Audi 608. BMW 589. Mini 57 (tie)10. Hyundai 57 (tie)11. Porsche 5412. Genesis 5213. Acura 51 (tie)14.

Title: Tesla — More Than An Auto Company | CleanTechnica
Author: Anonymous
Body: Published on October 28th, 2018 | by Alex VoigtOctober 28th, 2018 by Alex Voigt Apple renamed itself and Tesla renamed itself. You may say, “So what?!” Let’s dive into why this really is important to you. To prepare, expect the unexpected.This is about Tesla, but not about motors, autos, or vehicles, and I promise it won’t be boring.A name is an identity, description, and value. You choose one for your kids, your wife, your husband, your car, and your company. You choose one with care and after a deep thought process. You don’t pick a name lightly and you know there is a good reason why you select exactly this one.The name follows you through your life and you want it to be a good selection for the rest of your life. You want it to be perfect. You want it to fit the purpose.Companies that change a lot of time do should change their name.A name is darn important. It determines what you achieve and how you do it, and it can even make you fail. A name is a mission, a vision, and omission. It helps you to win, fail, or retreat.In February 2017, Elon Musk renamed one of his companies from Tesla Motors into Tesla. That is boring news that many didn’t see as worth reporting. It has largely been overlooked, disregarded, ignored, and forgotten — a boring footnote buried under much more exciting, attractive, and controversial Tesla stories.I believe and will make the case in this article that to rename Tesla Motors into Tesla was indeed one of the largest pieces of news of all, as it was the logical consequence of a profound, comprehensive, and complex thought process about what Tesla really is about and will be in the future.I believe that Tesla is an enterprise that is vastly misunderstood in what it does, what it produces and delivers to consumers. This is also part of the reason why I believe cofounder and CEO Elon Musk is still misunderstood by practically everybody.When Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, most people did not comprehend that it is a device not mainly intended to be used for phone calls. Its main purpose was something else. It just happened to be also able to make phone calls. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. Think about this for a second — what have you used and will you use your smartphone for in the future?You have likely surfed the internet, taken pictures, sent messages, bought stuff, paid for other things, sent emails, played games, downloaded apps, recorded videos, enjoyed movies, reviewed business files, stored energy, charged another device, received advice how to travel somewhere, talked to it, brought light into darkness, updated the software, uploaded data, and maybe you even made a call.Steve Jobs never intended the iPhone to be a simple replacement for your cell phone. It just happened to be a device that could also be used to make phone calls. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. But that is almost a side effect of the more important mission to connect you with your loved ones, society, and the world. It is a device to please you, to create unexpected beautiful emotions, and to make you a part of something larger than you.It is a supercomputer and almost an artificially intelligent extension of your brain, only limited by bandwidth from making you a person with superpowers. More safe, more reliable, more capable, more everything. A new level.Neuralink, one of Elon Musk’s companies, is trying to enlarge the still poor data rate between your brain and your smartphone to help humanity to improve and keep artificial intelligence (AI) under control. It partly already is and will soon be smarter and more intelligent than what humans could be otherwise. The main challenge here is our limited interface data rate called senses, which don’t yet connect well to hardware. A solution could to bypass the slow senses and connect directly with data processing, called nerves and brain. Spooky, isn’t it?!When Elon Musk and his team first rolled out a Tesla Model S, most people did not comprehend that it is a device that is not mainly intended to drive. Its main purpose is something else. It just happened to be also able to drive. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. Think about this for a second — for what have you used and will you use your EV in the future?You have likely surfed the internet, taken pictures, sent messages, bought stuff, paid for other things, sent emails, played games, downloaded apps, recorded videos, enjoyed movies, reviewed business files, stored energy, charged another device, received advice how to travel somewhere, talked to it, brought light into darkness, updated the software, uploaded data, and maybe you even made a call.Elon Musk never intended the EV to be a simple replacement for your car. It just happened to be a device that also could be used to drive you. But that is almost a side effect of the more important mission to connect you with your loved ones, society, and the world. It is a device to please you, to create unexpected beautiful emotions, and to make you a part of something larger than you.It is a supercomputer and almost an artificially intelligent extension of your brain, only limited by bandwidth from making you a person with superpowers. More safe, more reliable, more capable, more everything. A new level.The only real difference between the Steve Jobs device and the Elon Musk device is that one moves you physically, the other only virtually. Both move us and our emotions, both are experience devices designed to enlarge our ability to experience. It is indeed that simple.If you believe this article sounds like a broken record, then you are not wrong. The similarities between Apple and Tesla are obvious and mind-boggling. You can exchange the name Apple with Tesla and the content is still completely true.Apple Computers was for good reason renamed to Apple. Tesla Motors was for good reason renamed to Tesla. Apple realized it was not a computer enterprise any more but much more than that. Tesla realized it was not a Motor company any more but much more than that.Both companies defined and created a new market. They generated a need we did not know we had until we experienced it the first time. Using a smartphone the first time changes everything. Using a Tesla the first time changes everything.Once you have experienced that change, you will never go back to your cell phone or gasoline/diesel car.I started this writing about a name change and ended it talking about a you change.Images by Tesla, Kim Støvring (some rights reserved) and Jose Pontes var advertiser_id = 4; (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Tags: Apple, Elon Musk, steve jobs, TeslaAlex Voigt Alex Voigt has been a supporter of the mission to transform the world to sustainable carbon free energy for 40 years.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) momentum stops on report that FBI probe is ramping up - Electrek
Author: 
Fred Lambert

Body: October 26, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 26th 2018 3:24 pm ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertTesla’s stock (TSLA) has had some great momentum since the company announced a profit earlier this week, but it has since come to a stop due to a report that an FBI probe over Tesla’s reporting of Model 3 production is ramping up. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); On top of Tesla’s already outstanding issues with the SEC, the company has also reportedly been in trouble with the Justice Department.Though Tesla has been rumored to be under investigation for a while.Last month, the company said that it received “a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ”:“Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ and has been cooperative in responding to it. We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that there’s “a deepening criminal investigation,” based on unnamed sources.They wrote that the investigation is ramping up:“Action in the criminal investigation, headed by the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco, has intensified in recent weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission settled separate civil charges with Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the people said.”The issue is reportedly over Tesla allegedly misleading investors regarding of Model 3 production reports.Tesla set some aggressive goals for Model 3 production in 2017, but the ramp-up turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated.According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI is trying to prove that Tesla knew that the goals weren’t achievable.Update: In response to the report, Tesla says that it hasn’t recieved any formal inquiry over the investigation:“We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months.”I find all of this hard to believe. But if it is true, I think it’s stupid.Elon Musk sets very ambitious goals. That’s not new. He knows that they are hard to achieve, but he always aspires to make them happen.I am sure they could find some employees that believed it wasn’t achievable at the time, but it doesn’t mean that Tesla or Musk didn’t see it as a possibility at the time.Interestingly, this report comes just as Tesla’s stock went on a tear following record earnings… do I need to put on my tin foil hat here?Let us know what you think in the comment section below.Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.

Title: 
                Tesla's Elon Musk says tweet that led to $20 million fine 'Worth It' - Reuters
Author: Anonymous
Body: 1 Min Read(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision was “Worth It”. The tweet, sent late Friday evening less than an hour before Musk tweeted that he would take a break from Twitter “for a few days,” was in response to a question from a Twitter follower. The SEC in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed. Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement. Under the settlement agreement, Tesla needs to appoint an independent chairman by Nov. 13. Reporting by Kenneth Li; Editing by Chizu NomiyamaAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Title: DOJ Ramps Up Criminal Probe Into Tesla’s Model 3 Production Problems | The Daily Caller
Author: Anonymous
Body: REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File PhotoFederal investigators are examining whether Tesla misstated information related to the Silicon Valley company’s production of the Model 3, a car some believe could revolutionize the auto industry.FBI agents are also trying to determine if the company misled investors about the company’s business model going back to 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed sources. The probe come as Tesla celebrated only its third profitable quarter in the company’s history.Tesla disclosed in September that it was under an FBI investigation, 10 days before CEO Elon Musk and company officials struck a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over civil charges in a separate case involving Musk’s Twitter activity.The company “received a voluntary request for documents from the Department of Justice about its public guidance for the Model 3 ramp” earlier this year and was “cooperative in responding to it,” Tesla said in a statement addressing the report.FBI agents have asked former Tesla employees recently for testimony in the case, WSJ noted. Former employees received subpoenas, and FBI agents are seeking to interview them, the source said. Analysts have criticized production on the Model 3 since the company first unveiled the car in 2017.The logo for Tesla Motors is shown at the company headquarters in San Carlos, California June 30, 2008. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger joined with Tesla Motors representatives to announce Tesla’s decision to locate its new manufacturing plant for the second-generation, zero emission Tesla Roadster, in California. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith (UNITED STATES)Musk promised investors that Tesla would make 5,000 Model 3s per week to keep his legion of critics at bay. He said in a February 2017 phone conference that he was pushing suppliers to be ready for a weekly run rate of 4,000 vehicles by September of that year. But the numbers never materialized, and now investigators want to know if those numbers were inflated.The company’s body shop wasn’t fully functional during the early part of production, WSJ reported in October 2017. Tesla was still hand-building parts of the Model 3s, people familiar with the company’s production line told reporters at the time. Tesla is still reeling from an SEC probe earlier this summer into whether Musk lied to investors about taking the company private.Musk and Tesla agreed to resolve the probe without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The plan called for their combined $40 million in penalties to be distributed to affected shareholders, the SEC has said. (RELATED: Judge Approves Tesla-SEC Settlement, Forcing Elon Musk To Pay $20 Million)Musk told his Twitter followers in August that he has secured “funding” to take the company private at $420 per share, far more than the company was worth at the time of the tweet. His tweet followed a report suggesting Saudi Arabia became a major Tesla shareholder earlier in 2018.Follow Chris White on Facebook and TwitterContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Title: Tesla rival Lucid Motors gets $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, goes on massive hiring spree | Thinknum Media
Author: Anonymous
Body: Earlier this month, California-based electric car startup Lucid Motors ($LUCIDMOTORS) locked in a billion-dollar infusion from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. Through this deal, the official sovereign wealth fund of the Saudi government is helping to put Lucid on track to produce its first commercially available electric vehicle, the Lucid Air, on the market in 2020, thus putting it in direct competition with Tesla ($NASDAQ:TSLA).Since announcing its deal on September 17, Lucid listed more than double the amount of job openings month-over-month, which is understandable given a billion-dollar influx in capital.window.embedChart("qrlgrzou6y", false);Nearly every single one of these jobs are in its main location of Newark, California, with only two openings — one for an Electrical Engineer and another for general applications — listed for its future Casa Grande, Arizona factory.In Newark, Lucid is not only hiring more engineers, but also expanding into the next step of its development process: design and supplies to build its first commercial vehicle fleet. On September 17, the day it announced its deal, Lucid wasn't even hiring anyone to manage Supply Chain operations. Today, it's looking for 15 people for a variety of positions, such as Global Supply Managers and Supplier Quality Engineers.And, more importantly for its workers, it's looking into a Human Resources administrator to manage benefits and payroll.window.embedChart("m2cod3ql7d", false);Interest in the company is also growing steadily; while not at the level of Tesla's gigantic social media reach, Lucid saw a follower spike in the days after it inked its billion-dollar deal, as well as in the beginning of August.window.embedChart("dnxr2002q3c", false);Its web traffic can be described as widely inconsistent, however. When tracking its unique visitors, its largest days of viewership were on days with huge announcements, such as the Saudi Arabia deal and the reveal of the Lucid Air on December 14. Essentially, this means people are caring about what's new with the company, but don't seem to be exploring it — read: interested in seeing how to pre-order its cars — as much as on Tesla's website.window.embedChart("mv1iq55c6b", false);window.embedChart("m9ln1s4ms4", false);Of course, with recent controversy over the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khasoggi and reactionary protests by companies over Saudi Arabia's upcoming Future Investment Initiative summit, Lucid has kept quiet about whether it would still attend the conference and about its recent investment. Given that the conference is still happening later this week — albeit without a few — Lucid may be in the spotlight if one of its chief executives rubs elbows with Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud.

Title: Tesla taxi service in Netherlands wins fight for free, unlimited Supercharger use
Author: Anonymous
Body: A taxi driver in the Netherlands who pilots one of Tesla’s all-electric vehicles scored a significant victory on Friday over the commercial use of Tesla’s charging stations including its high-powered Supercharger network.A civil service judge from the Court of Amsterdam ruled in favor of a claimant who filed suit against Tesla Motors Netherlands BV, stating that the self-employed taxi driver for Schipoltaxi must be allowed the free and unlimited use of Tesla’s chargers, including usage of the often congested Supercharger station at the company’s Amsterdam location.“Car manufacturer Tesla must allow a taxi driver unlimited and free of charge to use his super-fast charging stations, also at the Amsterdam Zuidoost location,” reads the ruling.According to the (translated) court statement, the claimant purchased a Tesla Model S with 85 kWh battery in 2014, with the mutual understanding between Tesla and the buyer that the vehicle would be used as a taxi service. The claimant states, “At the time of the conclusion of our (purchase) agreement, it was expressly agreed at the time that I would be allowed to use all supercharges from Tesla in the world free of charge and without any restrictions. At the time of the conclusion of our agreement, it was entirely clear to Tesla that the vehicle purchased by me would be used as a taxi.”The claimant brought forth a passage from Tesla’s website, which at the time indicated that buyers of a Model S or Model X before January 31, 2018, would have free, unlimited Supercharging that’s also transferable when the vehicle was sold. In their suit against the California-based electric carmaker, the claimant cited an email that was sent by Tesla that would go against the company’s messaging of free and unlimited use of Supercharging.As read in the court statement:In an e-mail dated 11 January 2018, Tesla informed a number of taxi drivers, including [the plaintiff], among other things:” Increasingly, we are seeing a commercial use of the Supercharger (one of the charging stations for the Tesla, where electricity can be charged at high speed, viz.) In Amsterdam Zuidoost. This Supercharger is located at the same location as Tesla’s headquarters for Europe, also service center as well as sales location. This increasingly leads to queues for the Supercharger during peak hours and an unclear, and sometimes even dangerous (traffic) situation, for customers, employees, suppliers and other visitors. In view of (traffic) safety at this location, we reserve the right to change the access for taxis to this Supercharger in Amsterdam-Zuidoost after 31 January 2018, especially during peak hours, from 7:00 to 22 :00h, to limit. “On the same day, [the plaintiff] protested against it by e-mail. This e-mail states, among other things: ” At the time of the conclusion of our (purchase) agreement, it was expressly agreed at the time that I would be allowed to use all supercharges from Tesla in the world free of charge and without any restrictions. At the time of the conclusion of our agreement, it was entirely clear to Tesla that the vehicle purchased by me would be used as a taxi .”The latest ruling in favor of the Tesla taxi driver brings to light a hot topic of whether individuals and companies that have purchased a single or fleet of Tesla Model S and X, under Tesla’s narrative that buyers will have “free for life” Supercharging, can, in fact, use the vehicle(s) for commercial purposes. For the many taxi and livery services that have founded their business models largely around the financial upside of having free fuel, their livelihood depends on it. The vast majority would argue that they’re providing Tesla with free advertising to every passenger they transport, by showcasing the vehicle and benefits of driving electric to a potentially new customer.Other Tesla taxi services like Southern California-based Tesloop, which has risen to popularity among its passengers including celebrity clientele, yet unpopular among some local Tesla owners who claim that the company is occupying much-needed Tesla Supercharger stalls, tout the benefits of being able to drive a vehicle for nearly a half million miles while having virtually no maintenance costs.While the court ruling in the Netherlands may appear in favor of the Tesla taxi driver, you as a buyer or owner, be it for personal or commercial use, are encouraged to look at Tesla’s Supercharger policy through a wider lens. Play a part in the company’s mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market.Porsche appears set on making its customer’s transition to electric vehicles as painless as...Recent images of Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 from local Chinese media have provided what could...A Tesla owner had no idea that his Model 3 will be the victim...Every so often, an innovator with the capability to inspire and move people emerges....Tesla owners are getting new features for their in-car Sketchpad Easter Egg in the...Tesla news, rumors and reviews on all things Tesla.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) releases Q3 results: record $6.8 billion revenue and turns $312 million profit - Electrek
Author: 
Fred Lambert

Body: October 24, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 24th 2018 4:18 pm ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertAfter market close today, Tesla released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter 2018, which turned out to be a historic quarter.We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results and shareholders letter. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The company delivered higher on revenue with a new record of $6.8 billion. It ended the quarter with a rare profit of $1.75 per share.That’s significantly higher than what the street was expecting.As we reported in our preview post, Wall Street was expecting revenue of about $5.667 billion for the quarter and a loss of about $0.53 per share.It appears that the Model 3’s gross margin, which ended up being much higher than expected, made all the difference.Tesla claims that Model 3 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were both over 20% in Q3. The company says that labor hours per Model 3 decreased by more than 30% from Q2 to Q3.The automaker’s stock price is up 10% in aftermarket trading on the news.This is a game changer. Short thesis is falling apart. Naysayers can't even say that it is because of the credits since Tesla sold only $52 million worth in Q3. They would have been profitable either way. Incredible. Viva la rEVolution! congrats to @tesla and @elonmusk https://t.co/zSCJHbDIW1— Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) October 24, 2018The automotive business is clearly the star of this quarter, but Tesla’s energy business also progressed nicely, according to the shareholder’s letter.In Q3, Tesla’s energy storage deployments grew to 239 MWh and they deployed 93 MW of solar energy generation systems.The company still has a lot of debt and plans to repay parts of it during the current quarter, but its cash position remains strong.It grew by $731 million during the quarter and it now stands at $2.9 billion.Here we will be posting our follow-up posts about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):Here’s the shareholder letter in full: View this document on ScribdSubscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.

Title: Can Tesla Sustain Its Profitability Going Forward?
Author: Anonymous
Body: A customer inspects a Tesla Motors Inc. Powerwall unit inside a home in Monkton, Vermont, U.S. Photographer: Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist/BloombergTesla posted its first quarterly profit in two years on Wednesday, October 24, driven by its continued production ramp of the mass market Model 3 sedan and slightly better cost management. While revenues soared by almost 70% sequentially, its GAAP net income came in at $254 million. Free cash flows were also strong, coming in at $881 million, causing the company to reiterate that it would not be raising fresh capital to pay its impending debt maturities. While the results were encouraging, there have been some concerns as to whether the company can sustain this momentum. In this note, we take a look at some of the factors which are likely to drive Tesla’s performance in the near term.View our interactive dashboard analysis which outlines our expectations for Tesla in 2018. You can modify any of our forecasts or key drivers to see how changes would impact the company’s projected results or valuation.Model 3 Ramp Pays DividendsTesla’s automotive revenues soared by almost 90% sequentially to $5.9 billion. The company delivered a total of 56,065 Model 3 sedans to customers over the quarter, as it ironed out production issues, and scaled up manufacturing to as much as 5,300 cars per week towards the end of the quarter. Tesla’s gross margins for the vehicle also grew to over 20% on a GAAP basis, exceeding its guidance. The improvement was driven by a larger mix of all-wheel drive vehicles, which start at $55,000, a premium of about $6,000 over the long-range rear-wheel drive car. Tesla is also witnessing better economies of scale with the new model, noting that labor hours for the Model 3 declined by over 30% from the second quarter to the third, while indicating that it also fell below the levels for the premium Model S and X. There Could Be Some Near-Term HeadwindsWhile we believe that Tesla’s turnaround is largely here to stay, there could be some near-term headwinds. Firstly, the market for the premium Model 3s that the company is currently delivering (potential ASP of over $55,000 over the quarter for AWD models) is likely to gradually saturate, and Tesla is beginning to offer a new rear-wheel drive vehicle with a 260-mile range priced starting at $46,000. A larger mix of mid-range models could hurt average selling prices and gross margins for the company. The company has also indicated that there could be a negative impact of tariffs from Chinese sourced components, due to the current trade tensions between the U.S and China. Moreover, the one-time Federal tax credit that Tesla customers can avail on their cars is set to halve from $7,500 to $3,750 for vehicles delivered from the beginning of 2019, with the credit further reducing from mid-2019. This could effectively make Tesla’s cars more expensive in the U.S., potentially hurting demand.What Drove The Company’s Net Profits And Cash Flows Over The Quarter?Tesla’s net income was driven primarily by stronger automotive revenues, which rose by about $2.7 billion sequentially. The company’s cost of revenues also grew at a slower pace, allowing gross margins to expand. Tesla also made progress in reducing its R&D and SG&A spending over the quarter, leading to stronger operating margins and profits. Below, we illustrate the various factors that were responsible for the net income growth.Tesla’s Free Cash Flow increased to around $880 million over the quarter. While the company’s overall revenue growth and margin improvements were the primary drivers of sequential cash flow growth, Tesla also saw lower capital expenditures and lower payments to suppliers, with accounts payable on its balance sheet growing by 50% sequentially to $3.6 billion.Like our charts?

Title: VW CEO says they'll have 'EVs as good as Tesla's for half the price by 2020' - Electrek

Body: October 26, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 26th 2018 6:23 am ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertThe Volkswagen Group has made several ambitious claims about its effort to go electric since it was hit by the Dieselgate scandal.Now they make arguably their most ambitious claim yet: that they’ll have electric vehicles as good as Tesla’s for half the price by 2020. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); VW boss Herbert Diess made the comment on the ZDF program “Maybrit Illner” when talking about the automaker’s electrification effort (translated from German):“Here we come very strong now. We have invested 30 billion in electromobility, we have already rededicated a plant in Zwickau, and we are building an electric vehicle plant in Shanghai. We will come in 2020 with vehicles that can do anything like Tesla and are cheaper by half.”It’s rare in the auto industry that automakers will acknowledge other automakers by name publicly like that, but Volkswagen has been clearly going after Tesla in its electrification effort.Last year, Diess said that ‘ he sees Tesla as their main competitor;’.When talking about an EV that “can do anything like Tesla” and “is half the price”, Diess is presumably referencing the I.D. Concept, which is expected to be called ‘Neo’ (pictured above), since it’s the first new EV they plan to release in 2020.Before even unveiling the concept in 2016, VW announced that it would beat the Model 3 and Model X in electric range by misrepresenting the NEDC-rated range of the Model 3. In a presentation, it pinned the two vehicles against each other even though they are both unreleased yet and they are planned to be released years apart. VW mislabeled the range displayed for the Tesla Model 3. The footnote clearly shows that the range should be ‘NEFZ’, which is the German abbreviation for ‘NEDC’, but they used the only range Tesla disclosed for the Model 3 which is “a minimum of 215 EPA-estimated miles” (345 km) – not NEDC.Tesla hadn’t released estimated NEDC range for the Model 3 at the time, but by extrapolating the figure, it should be closer to 250 miles (~403 km) or pretty much the same as the upcoming VW, unlike what this chart suggests.As for the price, VW hasn’t confirmed it yet, but they have been talking about 25,000 euros (~$28,000), which is less expensive than the Model 3, but not half the price.The vehicle is expected to hit Europe and China in 2020 and come to North America later.VW is the champion of making EV claims, but it hasn’t much to show for those claims at this point.To be clear, I think it would be great for VW to launch the Neo at ~25,000 euros (~$28,000) with similar range and capabilities as the Model 3.I think it can be a success at that price, but I think they are doing themselves a disservice by comparing it to a Model 3.They don’t compete in the segment and it’s not even the same form-factor. It’s no ‘Tesla Killer’.What it can do though is open the market for more affordable long-range EVs, which is something that is much-needed. They should focus on that instead of comparing a hatchback to a premium midsize sedan just because they are both electric.What do you think?

Title: Tesla's Efficiency Edge Speaks Volumes For Its Engineering Lead
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla is aware that new all-electric cars coming, but notes in its 3rd quarter report that more than 15 years of battery pack and powertrain development give it an edge over established carmakers, most of which engaged in EVs significantly later.Tesla's advantage could be worth at least a few more years of lead and the Californian company says that proof lies in efficiency.As an example, the all-wheel-drive Tesla Model X from 2016 is rated at 3.1 miles of range per kWh according to the EPA. It's very good for such a big and heavy vehicle with fancy doors (that delayed the project a few times) and strong performance.Tesla Model 3 all-wheel drive raises the bar even higher to 4.1 miles of range per kWh.In the case of the competition, current and upcoming all-wheel drive electric cars (think Jaguar I-Pace, for example) vary between 2.4 to 2.8 miles of range per kWh according to EPA. That's not even on the level of the Model X.We do believe that the Tesla battery and powertrain package is the best on the market and that's what we also hear from Munro & Associates, which on the other hand notes that the body in white of the Model 3 was poorly designed (here lies the advantage of companies that existed way before Tesla).In the longer term, Tesla and legacy automakers will improve weaknesses and become more similar to each other, just like many ICE models and brands become similar to each others over the years. But for now, Tesla is leading on the side of efficiency, battery and powertrain.From Tesla's Q3 earnings report:"Battery pack and powertrain are at the heart of our vehicles. Over the past 15 years, we have worked hard to make the best powertrain anywhere on the market. By 2016, Model X energy efficiency was 3.1 miles of EPA range per kWh. This is an extremely important metric as it allows an EV to reach a long EPA range even when using a relatively small, inexpensive battery pack. With Model 3, energy efficiency improved dramatically to 4.1 EPA miles per kWh, the highest efficiency for any all-wheel drive EV. To put this in context, our current or upcoming AWD (2019) competition is expected to achieve 2.4 to 2.8 miles of EPA range per kWh. Model 3 has far better energy efficiency while also providing the quickest acceleration (0-60 mph in as little as 3.3 seconds) and the highest top speed (155 mph). Additionally, the curb weight of Model 3 long range RWD is only 3% heavier than its gas powered equivalents."
