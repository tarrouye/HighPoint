Title: Guess What? Everyone Was Wrong About Tesla
Author: Anonymous
Body: Flags fly outside of a Tesla Inc. building in Fremont, California, U.S., on Wednesday, June 20, 2018. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed another general assembly line to reach its production targets for the Model 3 vehicle. "A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks," Musk said on Twitter. Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergPretty much everything has been said about Tesla: it was selling vehicles at a loss and would never be able to make them under the right conditions and fast enough, that its founder was crazy and would lead the company to ruin, while one industry veteran acclaimed the Model S, calling on car collectors to buy one “before the company goes belly up.” But this quarter, Tesla has not only made tons of money, boosting its share price and giving the NASDAQ its best day in months, but has also fulfilled its production and distribution objectives, showing every sign of staying in the black, at least until it has to pay interest on loans in the first quarter of next year.For once, this third quarter does not seem to be the exception: everything indicates the company has found a stable way to generate profits. What’s more, Tesla is no longer an industry quirk: many have laughed at its production difficulties, grossly underestimating the achievement of moving from a standing start to mass producing 80,000 vehicles per quarter, but the company is now outselling Porsche, Mercedes Benz and BMW, making it the best-selling domestically-made car in the United States, and what’s more with a model that while expensive, is more advanced technologically, as well as cheaper and much safer to run that its internal combustion powered competitors.This quarter’s spectacular results have confounded the analysts’ forecasts, proving what some of us have been saying for a while now, that few in the motor industry and its so-called experts few understand the strategic vision of a company prepared to take risks to change the world. Virtually everyone was wrong about Tesla’s finances and its future, and many analysts are now scratching their heads trying to understand what happened while still making recommendations of questionable credibility. For one thing, most analysts simply can’t get their head round the idea that a company’s customers would volunteer to help distribute its vehicles, contributing to a project they consider themselves part of. Elon Musk will doubtless be basking in the warm glow of his “I told you so” triumph, because he does understand that people want to be part of a project that is not about selling cars, but changing the world. Understanding a business model like Tesla’s means understanding that the biggest difficulties aren’t necessarily the ones you imagine. Tesla has shown that difficult challenges can be overcome, as many other companies have done before. It has shown that it’s possible to design long-term strategies and implement them successfully, even if that means having to listen to baseless nonsense from people who don’t understand what it is we are doing. For example, that the company was wrong not to locate in China, that its production costs were unsustainable and would drive it out of business. Yet Tesla’s assembly line is now making progressive savings as production increases, and next year, depending on global demand, it could even consider moving a part of its manufacturing to China: now, not before.Meanwhile, the company’s profit margin on every Model 3 it sells is now around 20%, well above the industry average in its segment, and overnight its prospects for growth and profitability now seem not only credible, but probable, regardless of the belief in some quarters that Musk is crazy. The world would be a better place with a few more crazy people like him in positions of leadership.The best thing about all this is that we’re not even talking about an automotive company here. Sure, while some still insist on seeing Tesla as a car manufacturer and now begrudgingly accept that it’s not doing too badly thanks to its road map, it turns out that the price of batteries continues to fall, that demand for solar power installations grows as more and more batteries are produced and sold not only for vehicles but for homes and storage plants, and that hey presto, the company has miraculously found itself in one of the fastest-growing sectors as the evidence shows that long-standing environmental concerns are fully justified. Suddenly, it turns out there are many years of hard work behind Tesla’s overnight success.In other words, people who say it can’t be done should stop interrupting those who are doing it.

Title: Surprise! Tesla Is Quietly Taking Over the Luxury Car Market | Inc.com
Author: Anonymous
Body: While everyone has been distracted by the Shakespearean drama that is Tesla under Elon Musk, something's been happening under the radar: The automaker is quietly gaining an ever-larger share of the U.S. luxury car market, according to new research by the automotive site Edmunds. Just how much of a share? Statistics about Tesla are always a little iffy since the famously closed-mouthed automaker doesn't share its sales numbers or break its delivery numbers down by nation or region. But Edmunds analyzed things like registration records and estimated that Tesla sold 64,727 luxury cars in the third quarter of this year. That's just a couple of thousand less than Mercedes-Benz, and more than Cadillac and Lincoln combined. (Would you have believed a decade ago that an electric car could outsell Caddy and Lincoln combined? I wouldn't.)Edmunds' analysis indicates that Tesla has been gaining on its gas-powered competitors over time. And it's worth noting that, at least where the Model 3 is concerned, what's limited Tesla sales has been supply not demand--there's still a waiting list of people who want the car but can't yet get one. With Model 3 production having reached its goal of 5,000 a week back in June, and at least near that level since, Tesla stands to grab even more of the luxury car market share.Embedded in these stats is a fact that might not please Elon Musk: With a starting price of $49,000 the Tesla Model 3--while much more affordable than the company's six-figure models--still counts as a luxury car. In fact, it likely has a higher average price than other luxury cars, according to Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo. Since Teslas are sold in company-owned stores rather than traditional dealerships, Edmunds can't calculate what the average sales price actually is, although Tesla is known for not offering discounts. Still, this is all very good news for Tesla's bottom line. Even before the surprise earnings report this week showing that the company turned a profit last quarter, short-selling information site Citron Research reversed its position on Tesla, and Tesla's dominance of both the luxury car market and the electric car market is what changed the company's mind. "While the media has been focused on Elon Musk's eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being DOMINATED by Tesla," the company explained in its report reversing its position. Citron goes on to share a few charts that show just how powerful Tesla's market position is. In addition to its growing strength in the luxury car market overall, Citron notes that the Model S is by far the best selling large luxury car. As of this past quarter, Tesla is also crushing its competition in the electric car market. Now that Model 3 production is up to speed, Citron's charts estimate that it sold 54,550 Model 3s, 8,000 Model S vehicles and 7,000 Model X vehicles in the third quarter. (That total is a bit higher than Edmunds' but again these are all estimates.) If these charts are correct, the Nissan Leaf, once the best selling electric car in the world, was outsold by the Model 3 in the third quarter by a factor of more than 10 to 1.The next challenge for Musk and Tesla is to finally offer a car that doesn't price itself into the luxury category, a challenge that was supposed to be met with the Model 3. Faced with the need to increase production and achieve profitability, the company chose to focus first on the more expensive version of that model, and that decision seems to have paid off. But now Tesla and its customers can become victims of its success. After a car maker sells 200,000 electric cars, the $7,500 tax credit for buying one starts to disappear. Tesla recently confirmed that it had sold more than 200,000 cars, which means the incentive for Teslas is set to phase out next year, getting cut in half to $3,750 on January 1, and halved again to $1,875 on July 1. At the end of 2019, it vanishes altogether. Meanwhile, Musk has said that Tesla will start producing the $35,000 Model 3 late this year with mass production beginning next year. But skeptics predict that production won't start at all until sometime next year, and of course Musk is famous for setting difficult deadlines for his company, and then missing them. Whenever it does arrive, the $35,000 Model 3 will likely be met with enthusiasm, as mid-market car buyers finally get their chance at a Tesla.

Title:     Tesla must dramatically grow cash spend to meet goals - Business Insider

Author: Matthew DeBord
Body: In the abstract, I understand why: CEO Elon Musk believes humanity is living on borrowed time when it comes to global warming. If we don't replace gas-powered vehicles with electric cars — Fast! — we're doomed. As a practical matter, however, it appears that Tesla has long been needlessly living on the edge. And even though the company just posted a huge third-quarter, raking in almost $7 billion in revenue and posting a profit of more than $300 million, Tesla still has only about $3 billion in cash. In the auto industry, that's enough to stay in business for a year, optimistically, if the economy goes south. Tesla has run in the black on a quarterly basis before (although it's never managed an entire profitable year). Those have been times when I've wondered, "Why not consolidate the result, rather than pushing aggressively toward the next big thing?" The company hasn't done that, of course. So its uneven results have been out-of-step with the rest of the car business, which has been routinely profitable for almost a decade. On one hand, Tesla's strategy has given it a hefty market cap, larger than (profitable) Ford and (profitable) Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. On the other hand, Ford has eight times as much cash in the bank as Tesla; it could ride out a dozen moderate recessions and one complete financial collapse. Tesla's factory. Tesla Tesla has shown quite good capital discipline, but to a certain extent, its capacity to operate in a sort of lean-startup way is coming to a close. For example, its factory in Fremont, CA isn't running very efficiently, requiring more than twice as many workers to build around 200,000 vehicles as General Motors and Toyota needed to build 400,000 when they jointly operated the plant. Tesla is also assembling many of its Model 3 sedans on an ad-hoc line that was hastily erected under a tent in a parking lot. That was a good solution to a vexing problem, but it probably won't hold up long term. Fixing Fremont will obviously cost serious money. But that's just the beginning. Over the next few years, as Tesla goes from a 200,000-300,000-year-automaker to one that can produce possibly a million vehicles annually, it will need to spend staggering amounts of cash. For the moment, I'll concentrate on investment spending rather than dealing with debt (Tesla has around $10 billion on its balance sheet). Tesla currently makes three vehicles: the Model S sedan, the Model X SUV, and the Model 3 sedan. In the next year or so, it wants to start building the Model Y, a compact SUV. It also has a pickup truck, a new Roadster sports car, and a semi truck on the drawing board. The pickup could cost a billion to develop. The Roadster might be cheaper, so call it half a billion. The semi could be a billion or more. That's Tesla's entire cash hoard right there. Meanwhile, the Model 3 and the Model X could be due for updates in the next few years. Tesla is also spending to expand its Supercharger network and, as it sells more vehicles, will have to increase the scale of its retail and service locations. The really big one is a new factory, slated for China. That's likely to cost several billion; Tesla will surely finance it with debt, so it will be even more important for that investment to pay off (it doesn't have to pay off right away — if it runs for decades, inflation will erode some of the long-term liability). And unlike Tesla's traditional competition, Musk will be expanding his operation at 2018 prices. Just to go back to Ford for comparison, that carmaker is still operating plants built in the 1920s. Much of its manufacturing capacity was bought and paid for 50 or 60, or more, years ago. The Tesla Model 3. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider This is actually one of the critical points where Tesla's economics fail to compare with other Silicon Valley tech companies. Apple doesn't need to invest in factories. Facebook doesn't need to employ hundreds of thousands of workers. Even Musk's ambitious ideas about automated manufacturing aren't cheap: the robots in his factories can go for a million bucks a pop. Software companies can be worth billions on the back of some laptops, a cloud-server account, 20 people, and a WeWork space. Don't get depressed about this! If Tesla can continue to bolster its revenue by billions every quarter, it will have the cash flow to spend what it needs to spend. And if it can maintain its massive market share in electric vehicles as sales improve globally, the investment should pay off (automaker both make and lose money, long after they've matured, so Tesla doesn't have a free ride, and the company has never faced an auto-market downturn — or even really known a time when interest rates were especially high). In fact, Tesla should be completely blissed out about spending staggering amounts of money. Sure, I'd like to see them slow down and back a few billion. But right now, they can play offense. Becoming prematurely defensive could mean that they under-invest now and pay the price later. In any case, if the fourth quarter is also profitable, expect them to accelerate the pace of their cash burn. The question then will become, "Why don't you sell some more stock to raise money while times are good?" But that's an issue we'll have to tackle once enthusiasm over Tesla's fantastic recent performance dies down. Get the latest Tesla stock price here. This is an opinion column.

Title: Tesla Reports a Rare Quarterly Profit, Its Biggest Ever - The New York Times
Author: Anonymous
Body: AdvertisementSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteTesla on Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit in two years and its biggest ever. But for the electric-car maker and its unpredictable chief, the question is whether it can keep making money.The company’s third-quarter earnings were helped by cost-cutting, spending less on future models, delaying payments to suppliers and, most important, rushing to sell as many cars as possible. It may not be able to do all those things quarter after quarter.The company declared it a “historic quarter” and its chief executive, Elon Musk, promised that future would be brighter still, telling analysts on a conference call he expected Tesla to be profitable in the fourth quarter and in “all quarters going forward.” He was saying in effect that his company was no longer in start-up mode.Tesla reported a $312 million profit for the three months that ended Sept. 30, thanks to a surge in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The company has long promised that the model would help make electric vehicles and Tesla itself a mass-market phenomenon.The report is a milestone for Mr. Musk, whose leadership was cast in doubt in recent months as he faced a lawsuit by regulators over his musings on Twitter about taking the company private. He had also hurled insults against short-sellers and admonished analysts on a call for asking “boring, bonehead questions.” He agreed last month to step down as chairman of the company to settle a lawsuit in which the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of misleading investors about his plans to take the company private.On Wednesday, he was even-tempered on a conference call with analysts. He declined to answer a question about the makeup of the company’s board, saying he would discuss only operational issues. (In the agreement with the S.E.C., Tesla agreed to appoint two new independent directors to its board.)In the 15 years since Mr. Musk and his partners founded Tesla, the company has never reported an annual profit. In previous quarters, the company’s costs increased as it made more cars. To finance its operations, Tesla, which also makes solar panels and batteries, has had to sell stock, take out loans and ask customers to make $1,000 refundable deposits for cars and energy products that they might not get for many months.The profit the company reported in the third quarter will help stabilize Tesla’s finances and end a streak of quarters in which the automaker used close to $1 billion in cash. In the second quarter, the company reported a $718 million loss.Tesla ended September with $3 billion in cash compared with $2.2 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The company generated $881 million in free cash flow — cash produced through operations less capital expenditures. “The cash-flow number is impressive,” said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar. “That’s a lot of cash for a company their size.”But the company could face difficulties ahead. The increase in sales of the Model 3 could cause demand to soften in the fourth quarter.The company, which until recently only sold tens of thousands of luxury cars a year, will need to find many more buyers for the Model 3, which sells for $46,000 to $64,000 before federal and state tax incentives. Mr. Musk said that the company expected sales to remain strong as it starts shipping the car to Europe in the first three months of next year and Asia after that.Tesla produced more than 53,000 Model 3 cars from July to September, nearly twice as many as in the previous three months. Deliveries of the Model 3 totaled more than 56,000, about three times as many as in the previous quarter.“As long as they keep producing more cars than the previous quarter, there’s a good chance they can keep profits going,” Mr. Whiston said.In a sign that buyers are still interested in the car after months of waiting for it, Tesla said that of the 455,000 Model 3 reservations it reported having in August 2017, fewer than 20 percent had been canceled.Tesla next year is supposed to start making a more affordable version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, and Mr. Musk has said that Tesla would lose money on that model if the company produced it now. The cheaper Model 3 is important because the $7,500 federal tax credit available to buyers of Tesla cars will be cut by half on Jan. 1 and phased out entirely over the course of 2019, making the company’s cars more expensive.Tesla recently began offering a Model 3 priced at $46,000 as an interim step before it can produce the $35,000 version. “We don’t really have the ability to get to $35,000 right away,” Mr. Musk said, but he said Tesla was “probably less than six months from that.”Even though Tesla is finally hitting its stride in production, “the company isn’t out of the woods yet,” said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, a market researcher. “The $35,000 Model 3 remains a fantasy, and with the full tax credit for that car now off the table, it will be interesting to see how many buyers are willing to keep waiting for it to be a reality.”The company is still struggling to deliver cars to customers, which Mr. Musk has described as “delivery logistics hell.” The quality of the Model 3 has also come under question as many customers have complained about receiving cars with scratched paint, cracked windows and other defects.Consumer Reports on Wednesday lowered Tesla’s reliability ranking by six places, to 27th out of 29 automakers. The magazine said its members complained about the suspension in the company’s full-size Model S sedan.If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.As of Sept. 30, Tesla owed its suppliers $3.6 billion, up from $3 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company’s debt totaled more than $10 billion.Tesla shares closed at $288.50 on Wednesday before its earnings were released, down more than 20 percent from early August. The stock was up 10 percent in aftermarket trading.An earlier version of this article misstated Tesla’s cash at the end of the second quarter. It was $2.2 billion, not $2.4 billion.Advertisement

Title: Tesla Delivers, But the Stock Demands Much More - The Washington Post
Author: Anonymous
Body: With numbers like these coming, you have to wonder why Elon Musk was so vexed by the short sellers. Because, in the same quarter Tesla Inc.’s CEO indulged in that weird $420 takeover episode, the electric car company actually generated very good results.As promised, Tesla generated a GAAP profit of $1.75 per diluted share. It also turned in positive cash from operations of almost $1.4 billion, and generated free cash flow for the first time in eight quarters, to the tune of $881 million. Working capital changes helped that some, and capital expenditure came in a bit light. But it is still an impressive number. This enabled Tesla to end September with just shy of $3 billion in the bank, reversing the steady increase in net debt:Higher margins on the Model 3 provided a significant boost. Even adjusting for the sale of zero-emission vehicle credits – an irregular top-up to Tesla’s earnings over the years – the automotive gross margin came in above 25 percent. It remains to be seen whether Tesla also sold other regulatory credits; it only discloses those in its 10-Q filing, and they have moved the needle substantially at various points in the past. Still, on the face of it, I estimate it made almost $5,500 of pre-tax profit on each vehicle. In particular, research and development and selling, general and administrative costs were noticeably held down even as revenue jumped.One of the big questions hanging over these results is whether they will be sustained. Tesla flipped the script similarly in the third quarter of 2016 (another time Musk was bent on rebutting “naysayers”). Back then, though, ZEV credit sales and pushing out supplier payments were the big swing factors. This time, Tesla can instead point to high sales of vehicles, especially of higher-priced versions of the Model 3.What remains to be seen is if margins can remain healthy as demand migrates down to lower-priced versions – such as the $35,000 Model 3 that Tesla has yet to introduce. For Tesla’s part, it says it can keep the gross margin on the Model 3 “stable” this quarter while operating expenses rise only slightly. The answer to this question of operating leverage is critical.We aren’t going to know about that for a quarter or two at least. Still, Tesla’s stock jumped 11 percent in after-market trading anyway. At about $320 a share, that implies 34 times forecast 2020 earnings. Boost those forecast earnings by half off the back of these results, and the multiple would still be 23 times.That is still a lot of goodwill for a company whose recent history has been so volatile. Amid the good stuff, there were still some issues lurking in Tesla’s results. For example, average Model 3 weekly production of 4,300 in the third quarter remained light relative to earlier guidance, and production is expected to “increase” by an unspecified amount this quarter. The vaunted “solar roof” product, first unveiled in late 2016 when Tesla was in the throes of closing the SolarCity Corp. acquisition, remains in “intensive reliability testing.” And while there was a notable improvement, Tesla’s indebtedness and negative working capital remain high.On that front, Tesla ought to use any share-price strength to raise more capital, especially given its ambitious growth plans. This is still a cyclical business, and Tesla’s recent, sometimes bizarre history – born of weak governance – cannot just be erased. A good quarter and some promised reforms (at the SEC’s prodding) are welcome. But Tesla must do a lot more, and sustainably, to justify the hopes already embedded in its stock.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Title: Tesla Finally Makes a Profit While Increasing Model 3 Production, and Promises to Keep Doing It | WIRED
Author: Anonymous
Body: People usually have three questions about Tesla and Elon Musk’s promises: When can I get a $35,000 Model 3? Can Teslas drive themselves? And can Tesla actually make money selling electric cars?The answer to the first two, when Musk is asked, is usually something along the lines of “in six months or so.” On the third question, he’s been clearer. He pledged that the automaker would be profitable before the end of 2018.Tesla just released its financial results for the third quarter of the year and reported a net profit of $312 million, finally allowing Musk to keep a promise. “We delivered more cars in this quarter than in all of 2016,” the CEO said on a call to discuss the numbers.Proving that Tesla can make a profit has been a crusade for Musk, and the figure is higher than most analysts had estimated. He’s said that the criticism of the company—that it has to be profitable to be viable in the long term —is fair, and that he's been eager to prove the doubters wrong. One quarter in the black is a start, but Musk will have to keep this up to accelerate away from doubts about the long-term future.“Q3 2018 was a truly historic quarter for Tesla,” the company said in today’s investor update letter. A grandiose line? Sure. Hyperbolic? Not that much. Tesla released production numbers for the quarter at the start of this month, which showed it delivered 52,239 Model 3s. Add in the Model S and X, and that's a record more than 80,000 vehicles delivered between July and September.At the end of the quarter, Tesla actually welcomed existing customers as volunteers to help deliver cars, as that became the new bottleneck. “I’ve never heard of a case where customers volunteered their time to help a company succeed,” said Musk. “That’s amazing. It chokes me up actually.”This news is all the sweeter given what Tesla has endured in 2018. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Musk with misleading investors when he tweeted his plan to take the company private, resulting in a $40 million fine (half for him, half for the company), and having him step aside as chairman of the board of directors.The company laid off 9 percent of the workforce in June, saying that it was a difficult but necessary reorganization. Moreover, Tesla has continued to struggle with quality control. Coincidentally, just released as well are the latest reliability rankings from Consumer Reports, showing the automaker slipping to 29th place out of 29—mostly due to issues with the Model S. The Model 3, which is less complex, has “average” reliability. Oh, and Musk also smoked weed on a podcast.But making money seems to trump all, and Tesla shares are riding high even as the rest of the stock market is slumping.The positive financial results come as Tesla launched a new, lower-priced version of the Model 3. This isn’t the long-awaited mass market, “standard range” vehicle that will have a redesigned battery and cost $35,000. This is a long-range battery pack with some cells left out, sold as a “midrange” car as Tesla looks to keep sales moving in the fourth quarter this year. It was originally $45,000, but overnight the price crept up $1,000, as Tesla likely adjusts to demand.The car is also an olive branch to customers who placed a $1,000 deposit in 2016, in hope of securing a cheap Tesla. Although this car isn’t what Musk promised, it will likely mean US customers can get a cheap-ish car before the end of 2018, after which the federal tax credit for EVs of $7,500 starts to phase out for Tesla.Tesla now says it makes a 20 percent gross profit margin on the Model 3, which is up there with luxury trucks and cars, and higher than most cheaper cars. Much of it is due to selling higher-end, expensive models, like all-wheel drive and performance versions for as much as $77,000.But the company reported the gross profit margin for the Model 3 will stay the same even as lower-price cars are snapped up by impatient buyers. The company says it’s constantly making savings and improvements in the manufacturing process. “Labor hours per Model 3 decreased by more than 30 percent from Q2 to Q3,” Tesla says, “falling for the first time below the level for Model S and X. In Q4, we will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate.”Musk also tweeted this week that Tesla would be cutting the number of options available for interior choices (like type of wood, color of leather) on Model S and X vehicles, as the company works to streamline production. On the Model 3, it currently only offers two interior options, black or white seats.Tesla actually has had profitable quarters before; the last was in the third quarter of 2016, during production hell for the Model X, as it’s now doing with the 3. (Now as then, Musk sent an email to employees imploring them to help show investors Tesla could be profitable.) The only other profitable quarter was back in 2013, when it started to fill early Model S preorders.Tesla’s not alone in burning through cash as it’s vying to grow and develop as a business. Amazon went public in 1997 but didn’t have a full profitable year until 2003. Twitter still hasn’t had an entire year in the black. And the big automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, both lost so much money in the global financial crisis that they declared bankruptcy in 2009 and relied on government money to recover.But Musk indicated unprofitable days were over for his company. “Our aspiration will be for all quarters going forward, we can be positive cash flow,” he said. But he then added in a caveat—saying that didn’t count quarters, like the fist one of next year, where the company has to make a major payment on loans.As for answering those other questions, Musk said the company is making good progress on self-driving, but needs its new computer chip, which won’t go into cars until the beginning of next year, at the earliest. What's more, Tesla doesn’t have the ability to build the $35,000 Model 3 right away and stay profitable, but he hopes the $46,000 one is a step in that direction.Musk then threw in reminders of his commitments to the Tesla Semi, Roadster, pickup truck, and solar tile roof on the call, almost as throwaways. "I think we have the most exciting hardware road map of any company by far," he said. If he can fulfill all these promises, then Tesla has a good 2019 ahead of it.Tesla has just delivered the first 30 models of its most crucial car, the Model 3. The new addition to the Tesla family is supposed to be the “affordable” car, starting at $35,000. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says over half a million people have already paid $1000 to reserve their Model 3.CNMN Collection© 2018 Condé Nast.

Title: Tesla rides Model 3’s popularity to its first profit in two years - The Verge
Author: Anonymous
Body: Filed under:The company made $311 million — more than any other quarter in Tesla’s historyTesla has posted its first profitable quarter in two years, its third ever, thanks to the popularity of the Model 3 sedan. The automaker said on Wednesday that it generated $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 and walked away with $311 million in profit — the most the company has ever made in a quarter. The company finished the quarter with $3 billion in cash, up $731 million from the second quarter of the year. Tesla’s last two profitable quarters came in 2013 and 2016, and it has never made a profit over an entire year.“Q3 2018 was a truly historic quarter for Tesla,” CEO Elon Musk and CFO Deepak Ahuja wrote in a letter to investors. “Model 3 is attracting customers of both premium and non-premium brands, making it a truly mainstream product.”The turning of financial fortunes can be largely attributed to how Tesla nearly doubled production of the Model 3 from the second quarter to the third this year. In fact, the company has made so many cars recently that it overwhelmed itself with delivery efforts, switching from so-called “production hell” to “delivery logistics hell,” as Musk famously put it. “Fortunately, these challenges are easier to solve than vehicle manufacturing, and we made improvements through the quarter,” Musk and Ahuja write. In total, Tesla wound up delivering 56,065 Model 3s in North America in the third quarter, which is 225 more than it said when it announced initial delivery counts for the quarter in early October. The company also sounds ready to cash in on demand in other markets, with Musk and Ahuja saying Tesla will start taking orders in Europe and China for the Model 3 “before the end of this year.” After finally turning a profit on the Model 3 earlier this year, Tesla now says it is now pulling in more than a 20 percent margin on the car. It did this thanks to a reduced cost of raw materials, but also by cutting the number of labor hours needed to make each Model 3. Tesla says this figure dropped 30 percent from the second quarter to the third, and that it now takes less time to produce a Model 3 than to make a Model S or X. Also helping boost the company into profit was the sale of $52 million worth of zero-emission vehicle credits to other automakers.Tesla says it is still targeting early 2019 for the launch of the long-promised $35,000, 220-mile version of the Model 3. The company delayed the most affordable version of its small electric sedan in order to focus on the higher-cost, higher-margin versions. Musk even said this year that focusing on the lower-cost Model 3 would cause the company to “die.” The delay, combined with the fact that Tesla’s cars are now no longer eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, has contributed to some cancellations. But Tesla says demand for the Model 3 remains strong, and that “less than 20 percent” of the 455,000 reservation holders have asked for a refund. The company also says that it doesn’t expect selling lower-priced cars to impact profitability long term.Despite the boost in production’s effect on Tesla’s bottom line, the company is still running into problems related to that explosion in scale. Tesla has had problems with customer service, with Musk recently admitting that the company has “major gaps” in its nationwide coverage. And while the company’s cars consistently earn some of the highest safety ratings in the industry, its widely documented quality control issues continue to plague customers new and old. Before the earnings letter dropped on Wednesday, Consumer Reports said that Tesla ranked the third worst for reliability among major automakers. Tesla also has more than $10 billion in debt, with more than $1 billion due in the next six months. This, along with future projects like the Model Y crossover, Tesla Semi, and factories in Europe and China, has had many financial analysts expecting Tesla to raise new money sometime soon. But an increase in cash on hand coupled with increasing revenue from other parts of Tesla’s business — like its energy generation and storage business, which increased by $25 million to just shy of $400 million this quarter — could help Musk continue to make his case that he won’t need to take more of anyone else’s money. The release of the quarterly letter wraps one of the wildest quarters in Tesla’s history, which is saying something for a company with as many ups and downs as a reality TV show. On August 7th, just days after the company recapped its second quarter performance, Musk made a surprise announcement on Twitter about how he was considering taking the publicly traded company private again. Musk said he wanted to delist the company from the NASDAQ once its stock price hit $420 per share and claimed that he had “funding secured” to back the potentially massive buyout required to pull off such a move. Musk, it turned out, did not have any funding secured. The $420 share price cutoff he suggested was, in part, a joke about weed meant to impress his girlfriend, the musician Grimes. Less than two months after Musk sent those tweets, he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for committing securities fraud. The SEC’s complaint, built largely on subpoenaed internal communications at Tesla, showed that Musk’s privatization attempt (and the way he went about it) was also a surprise to many of the people inside the company. While Musk had told Tesla’s board of directors that he was considering the idea, he didn’t give them a heads-up that he was about to make a public announcement. Tesla’s CFO had to email Musk shortly after his first tweets to suggest the company draft an official press release, and the company’s head of Investor Relations spent the hours and days after reassuring shareholders that the plan was legitimate, despite a lack of evidence to support that claim. Musk quickly settled the suit. He agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla for three years, and both he and Tesla were ordered to pay $20 million fines. The company has been ordered to hire a lawyer to oversee all of his public communications, including his tweets. As it moves into the final quarter of 2018, Tesla still has to name a successor Musk as chairman of the board of directors. The board is also getting two new independent directors as a result of the settlement with the SEC, though one of those roles can be filled by the new chairman. Tesla also reiterated plans to accelerate its manufacturing timeline in China. The company recently signed off on a lease for the land outside Shanghai where it plans to build a new Gigafactory, and on Wednesday it said it is “aiming to bring portions of Model 3 production to China during 2019.” China has been an increasingly important market for Tesla over the years, but the recent trade war with the US has caused the company’s cars to be subjected to a 40 percent tariff. Beyond that, Musk said the upcoming Model Y crossover has been approved for production, though it still won’t be built until 2020. Musk added that he is “personally most excited about” the Tesla pickup, though. “I think that’s going to be some next level stuff there,” he said.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

Title: More Smoke And Mirrors Coming From Tesla
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla Inc.’s surprise earnings announcement is yet another sign of a company that lacks real leadership and anything resembling a long-term strategy.Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Telsa Inc., is seen on a television on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, Sept. 7, 2018. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg)While the company has not explained its decision to pull ahead its third-quarter earnings, there’s been plenty of speculation online as to the reasoning behind it. Some are guessing that Tesla’s numbers are going to be even more disappointing than usual, suggesting the company wants to get the bad news behind it. But most believe it is because Tesla is finally going to post a profit for the first time since 2016, and they say CEO Elon Musk wants to make sure the good news is not eclipsed by the U.S. midterm elections.I think the bulls are right, but that doesn’t mean that Tesla has turned the corner. And Tesla’s rush to trumpet its good news is yet another sign that this a company driven by short-term thinking. Reading the tea leavesMusk promised third-quarter profits and positive cash flow, and Tesla has gone out of its way to make good on his pledge — but not by addressing the company's underlying issues.“Like the shenanigans in the second quarter to produce 5,000 Model 3s for one week in June, in the third quarter production builds were biased to high revenue models and car deliveries were manipulated. So, we fully expect that Tesla has found a way to show a profit for the third quarter and would be very surprised if they don't, given the hoops they jumped through to do so,” said analyst David Kudla, chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, in a note Tuesday morning. “Just as Elon Musk used customers as beta testers on Tesla’s Auto Pilot, he used customers’ deposits and full payments to fatten revenue on vehicles in which deliveries were being delayed.”Achieving profitability and positive cash flow are the least of Tesla’s worries. The real challenges it faces are on the production front.The company is still struggling to deliver even a few thousand cars a week — compared to the tens of thousands that even smaller automakers manage without a perceptible hiccup.Moreover, the cars Tesla does manage to deliver are still not ready for prime-time. Kudla says that over half of Tesla’s Model S owners had their cars in the shop for at least a week, noting that in Tesla’s score worst among newer hybrids and electric vehicles when it comes to reliability.Real leaders leadA real leader would address these problems head-on. He or she would not blame them on a lack of car carriers or the surprise discovery that their company lacks nationwide service coverage. Nor would they indulge in inebriated online rants or potentially criminal market manipulation.Rather, a real leader would take responsibility for letting customers down and outline a clear plan for addressing the company’s challenges. Then, they would make darn sure their company delivered on those promises — and on its vehicle orders. I mean really deliver on them by addressing the underlying problems, not by toying with the production schedule or banking customer deposits to achieve short-term wins.I am a bestselling author, speaker and president of Red Team Thinking LLC.

Title: How Tesla Could Dominate The Auto Industry
Author: Anonymous
Body: A Tesla Model 3 automobile is on display. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)One of the stronger arguments Tesla bears have put forward is that they expect major car makers like Ford, Mercedes, Honda and Toyota to eventually release a "Tesla-killer." Gorden Lam, one of my managers, doesn't see this happening anytime soon. There are good reasons why Tesla has no real competitors at this time. If one does not emerge soon, Tesla looks poised to dominate the auto industry in a few years.Where's The Competition?Five years ago, Citron Research shorted Tesla because they foresaw that:By the time this (Tesla's) product is even approaching market, there will be multiple other 200-mile range plug-ins that have been out for years.Earlier this week, when Citron reversed their short position, they said it was because "Tesla is destroying the competition". But what is the competition? Is it electric cars? Is it luxury cars? Is it all cars?From the quote above, it seems that five years ago Citron thought the competition would come from other 200-mile range plug-ins. However, based on recent reports, it is clear that Tesla is attracting customers in the entire luxury car market, not just the all-electric luxury car market.This bodes well for Tesla's future, not so much for companies that make cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE).As Tesla's production ramps up and fixed costs are divided among more cars, it will become possible for Tesla to make a profit on lower priced cars that can compete with ICE cars across the board.On Wednesday's earnings call, Elon Musk said Tesla could increase production from 5,000 to 7,000 cars/week without much capex spending. Think about that! Tesla can make 40% more cars without increasing their fixed costs by much.Musk did not say this, but I think it means the fixed costs per car are about to drop by about 40%. When that happens, I think Tesla will be able to compete profitably for mainstream car buyers.How Will Competitors React?Like Citron Research, I am surprised at how ineffective the leading car companies have been in developing a "Tesla-killer."Rather than compete with Tesla, Ford seems to be running away. In April, Ford announced they were dropping traditional cars from their product line to focus on crossovers and SUVs. This strategy makes sense from an accountant's point of view as these are Ford's most profitable products.However, since there is no reason Tesla could not make an SUV, Ford's decision to focus on their high-margin products only protects them competing with Tesla for the time being.Mercedes and Volvo have shown concept cars which basically means they are years away from production.GM is currently selling the Chevy Bolt, which on paper looks like a competitor. However, Gorden Lam points out that sales of the Bolt plunged 40% in September while Tesla's Model 3 was the fifth best selling car. The customers have spoken. Honestly take a look at both cars. Which one you would rather own?The Award-winning Chevy Bolt EV is presented during the four-day auto trade show AutoMobility. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)It's almost as if GM doesn't want to sell too many Bolts. This would make sense if the Bolt is a money-loser and GM only sells it to get ZEV credits.I don't know what GM is thinking, but the Bolt is not a Tesla-killer.The Clock Is TickingIf it turns out customers prefer to fuel their cars with $1/day of electricity instead of $50/week of gasoline, the current auto industry leaders are woefully unprepared.In order to compete, they will have to overcome two big hurdles.First, they need to find a source of batteries for their cars that are competitive with the ones Tesla makes. Musk said in the last call that Tesla batteries have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. This could be hyperbole, but the fact is that a competitor would have to match Tesla's cost per kilowatt hour or cede a big advantage to Tesla.Second, they need to provide customers a way to charge their cars on long trips. Otherwise, customers will need a second car for long trips.One reason you don't see the big car companies taking steps to compete effectively with Tesla is because doing so will cannibalize their existing business.It takes a strong leader to convince everyone with a stake in the company to make major investments to compete in a business in which you don't have an advantage and which will cannibalize your existing profits.I don't think the CEOs of the other car companies are able to take this step. Musk was able to do it because Tesla didn't have ICE car profits to cannibalize.We've Seen This BeforeWhen Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 a lot of investors thought Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry and Sony Ericsson would make short work of Apple.In time, the leaders of the mobile phone industry have almost completely changed. The process took years to unfold, and generated a lot of wealth for those who saw it coming early on.The situation is repeating itself with Tesla right now. There are lots of people betting that today's auto industry leaders will eventually put down the threat posed by Tesla. They have the resources to do it but they are certainly not moving very fast. Until we see a serious competitor to the Model 3 come to market, I'm betting on Tesla.If you would like to be notified when Gorden Lam updates his views, click here.If you would like to be notified when I write about Tesla or other stocks you and I are both following, click here.I am the CEO and founder of Marketocracy, Inc.,and portfolio manager at Marketocracy Capital Management, LLC.

Title: Tesla’s Navigate on Autopilot update is now live  - The Verge
Author: Anonymous
Body: Filed under:The feature will be able guide ‘a car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp’ with a driver’s supervisionAfter rolling out its Version 9 of Autopilot a couple of weeks ago, Tesla has followed up with an additional update to equip its vehicles with its Navigate with Autopilot feature, a driver assistance system that brings the vehicles closer to being able to drive on their own. Tesla officially released the Version 9 update earlier this month, which included a new dash cam feature, games that can be played while the car is parked, and updates to the vehicle’s navigation settings, and indicated that Navigate would be following shortly thereafter. In a blog post, Tesla says that with driver supervision, cars equipped with the feature will be able guide “a car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and taking exits.” This isn’t fully autonomous driving: drivers will need to approve lane changes by using the stalk, although Tesla notes that they’ll be able to waive this in future updates. Tesla also says that drivers will still need to pay attention to the road, and characterizes this as “an additional layer of safety that two eyes alone would not have.” Tesla also released a short video that demonstrates how to use the feature, showing off how to activate the feature and how to approve lane-changes and merging on the highway. The system uses an array of cameras, radar, and sensors to determine what objects are surrounding the vehicle, and uses this information to help the vehicle navigate, all while sending data back to the company’s vision and neural net system, allowing it to improve its software. Tesla says that since Autopilot was launched in 2015, it’s collected more than a billion miles worth of data. But there have been concerns — Autopilot was apparently responsible for a navigational error that resulted in a fatal crash, and the company settled a class action lawsuit over delays to the system back in May. Tesla also recently stopped promoting the “Full Self-Driving” option for its cars, saying that it was taking the option off temporarily because it was causing too much confusion.

Title: Tesla's 'Navigate on Autopilot' goes live in North America tonight
Author: Anonymous
Body: When Tesla rolled out its 9.0 software to vehicles earlier this month, it held back one feature for some additional testing: Navigate on Autopilot. Now, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that a beta test of the feature will become widely available across North America tonight. In a move that Musk has previously described as a time when "we will begin to enable full self-driving features," it gives more control over to the car from highway on-ramp to off-ramp.As described by Tesla:Our most advanced Autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot is an active guidance feature that, with driver supervision, guides a car from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, navigating highway interchanges and taking exits. It's designed to make finding and following the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the highway when Autopilot is in use.The driver is still supervising, and will need to confirm before the car changes lanes, but overall it could mean requiring much less interaction on these closed-access highways. Despite controversy as a result of crashes and occasional complaints, Musk said that until now Autopilot has focused on increasing safety. Even though the "full self-driving" option may be gone from Tesla's website, it's clearly still a goal for the company.Update: Tesla has published a blog post that explains the feature further, how to use it and includes a video showing how to engage it. Drivers will need to enable the feature in their Autopilot menu, and it has four settings for speed based lane changes (Disabled, Mild, Average, or Mad Max) and will prompt to change lanes either to keep the car on its route, or to stay closer to its target speed.According to Tesla, "future versions of Navigate on Autopilot will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to," and its future AI chip will enable full self-driving capability on the platform. In another tweet, Musk predicted that waiving the confirmation for a lane change could arrive once "safety looks good" after about 10 million miles of driving with the feature.Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonightRichard's been tech-obsessed since first laying hands on an Atari joystick.

Title: Tesla releases demo of Navigate on Autopilot with details on the rollout - Electrek
Author:

Body: October 27, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 27th 2018 12:53 am ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertTesla is releasing a rare new feature under its Enhanced Autopilot package: Navigate on Autopilot.Today, the automaker released a new video demonstration of the feature and more details on the rollout. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Navigate on Autopilot was supposed to be in the first release of Tesla’s v9 software update, but they decided to pull it for further validation.The feature was supposed to enable on-ramp to off-ramp driving on the highway with the system doing all its own lane changes based on speed and the destination entered in the navigation system.As we reported earlier this week, Tesla started releasing the feature in its 2018.42 software update, but it doesn’t automatically perform the lane changes. Navigate on Autopilot suggests the lane changes and the drivers need to initiate them with the blinker stall.Now the automaker is releasing the feature to the wider fleet and it explains the change in a blog post:“While initially the feature will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn stalk before the car moves into an adjacent lane, future versions of Navigate on Autopilot will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to. In both of these scenarios, until truly driverless cars are validated and approved by regulators, drivers are responsible for and must remain in control of their car at all times”Tesla said that owners have already “driven tens of millions of miles to support the validation of Navigate on Autopilot”, but CEO Elon Musk said that they will need about 10 million more miles to make the system automatically initiates the lane changes.Tesla released a quick video demonstration of Navigate on Autopilot in a Model 3:Here’s the full Tesla blog post about the release of the feature:Today in the U.S., we’re beginning to roll out our most advanced Autopilot feature ever: Navigate on Autopilot. Since introducing Software Version 9.0, Tesla owners with Enhanced Autopilot have driven tens of millions of miles to support the validation of Navigate on Autopilot, allowing us to collect performance and safety data at scale, based on real-world driving.While initially the feature will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn stalk before the car moves into an adjacent lane, future versions of Navigate on Autopilot will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to. In both of these scenarios, until truly driverless cars are validated and approved by regulators, drivers are responsible for and must remain in control of their car at all times.Navigate on Autopilot is an active guidance feature for Enhanced Autopilot that, with driver supervision, guides a car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and taking exits. It’s designed to make finding and following the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the highway when Autopilot is in use. While drivers should always be attentive when using Autopilot, stalk confirmation for lane changes allows us to ensure that drivers are paying attention at the exact moment they need to, and combined with the redundancy of eight external cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors, it provides an additional layer of safety that two eyes alone would not have.To use Navigate on Autopilot, drivers must first enable Navigate on Autopilot and Autosteer in the Autopilot settings menu. If Navigate on Autopilot is available on a drive, it can be enabled by selecting the Navigate on Autopilot button in a destination’s turn-by-turn direction list. Once it is in use, our 360-degree visualization on the center display shows a single blue line indicating the suggested path of travel. There are two types of lane changes that Navigate on Autopilot will suggest – route-based lane changes that are designed to keep you on your navigation route, and speed-based lane changes, which are designed to keep your vehicle moving as close to your set speed as possible.Navigate on Autopilot can be customized to a driver’s preferences, including four settings for speed-based lane changes (Disabled, Mild, Average, or Mad Max). When enabled, Navigate on Autopilot’s speed-based lane changes will suggest transitions into adjacent lanes that are moving faster, in the event that your vehicle is traveling slower than the set cruise speed (for instance, if you approach a slow-moving car or truck ahead). The Mild setting suggests lane changes when you’re traveling significantly slower than your set speed, whereas Mad Max will suggest lane changes when traveling just below your set speed.Since we launched Autopilot in 2015, more than 1 billion miles of real-world driving data have been used to support the feature. Navigate on Autopilot is built exclusively for our Enhanced Autopilot platform, which includes a powerful onboard computer, ultrasonic sensors, radar, and external cameras that feed our Tesla-developed neural net. Advanced machine learning algorithms allow our cars to collect and process data in milliseconds. The future introduction of our Tesla-developed AI chip with our Full Self-Driving platform will allow the speed at which our system processes data to increase by an order of magnitude and take a meaningful leap toward our full self-driving future.As more miles are collected with Navigate on Autopilot in use, we will continue to make it even more capable and efficient. Navigate on Autopilot will begin to roll out this week to U.S. customers who have purchased Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving Capability. The feature will be introduced in other markets in the future pending validation and regulatory approval.Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.

Title: Tesla Pushing Out "Drive On Navigation" Autopilot Feature Tonight | CleanTechnica
Author: Anonymous
Body: Published on October 27th, 2018 | by Kyle FieldOctober 27th, 2018 by Kyle Field Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to tweets this evening to break the news that the new Autopilot feature “Drive on Navigation” would be pushed to out to the fleet of production vehicles starting tonight. When similar news broke for the release of Tesla’s version 9.0, the release was spread out over nearly two weeks as eager owners helicoptered over their smart devices waiting for a software update notification (including me).The new Drive on Navigation feature will allow Tesla owners with Autopilot hardware 2.5 and Enhanced Autopilot software to use Autopilot to navigate many of the scenarios commonly encountered on highways, including transitioning from one highway to another, automatic lane changes after driver confirmation, and even taking the exit — as long as the vehicle is following a navigation route in the car’s nav system.The feature will also include the ability to automagically change lanes while on the freeway, though this feature will initially require a confirmation from the driver. Elon clarified the implementation in a response to Jaden Smith that the feature will require the driver to hit the turn signal for the first couple of million miles. Assuming the feature passes the test, the requirement to hit the turn indicator will be removed and the car will just fly along on the freeway towards its destination.Drive on Navigation is the first of the expanded Autopilot features originally slated to roll out with the initial release of version 9.0 but held from the production version at the last minute by Tesla. Personally, a company that holds off on releasing a version of the software that controls the 4,000 pound metal rocket tasked with moving my family and me to the grocery store and back because it might not be safe earns a place on my good side, but maybe that’s just me.When rolled out, the new feature will take Autopilot to the next level and represents a noteworthy step along the path to Full Self Driving. Elon Musk’s greatest blessing and one many around the world claim to be a curse is his aspirational timing for company achievements. What the critics and the pessimists fail to realize is that it is these very same targets that get the team at Tesla fired up to achieve, that get them to strive to accomplish what the world thought to be impossible mere months earlier.In April of 2017, Elon went before the world in a TED talk and proclaimed that a Tesla would drive from Los Angeles to New York without the need for a human to touch the steering wheel before the end of the year, but that failed to happen. At the time, he envisioned that Tesla’s vehicles would be capable of fully autonomous driving in “about 2 years,” and while there is still some time left on that horizon, it does appear that the extended duration of the Model 3’s “Production hell” consumed some of the energy he would have used to push these side projects forward more. Either that or they’re just more difficult for his Autopilot team than expected.Is version 9.0 the start of a renewed public push towards fully autonomous driving for Tesla? If so, we should expect the veritable floodgates of meaningful, impactful software updates coming from the manufacturer over the next few months. That does make its vehicles more attractive and serves to draw in new buyers, but more importantly than that, it means that drivers of Teslas and the cars they don’t hit will be even safer.That means fewer accidents, fewer automotive and pedestrian injuries from cars, and ultimately, fewer fatalities. Safety reigns supreme at Tesla and the renewed focus on Autopilot and Full Self Driving serve to advance that goal. As those updates continue to flow out, it is all the more important that drivers continue to remain vigilant while Autopilot is driving, until Full Self Driving is so much better than a human driver that accidents are all but impossible in a passenger’s lifetime.At that point, Tesla’s shared autonomy fleet will become the go-to service for Transportation as a Service (TaaS), taking the place of services similar to and including Uber and Lyft. Tesla is in a race to the finish against other self-driving technology companies, but what those other companies seem to miss in that debate is that Tesla is already winning that battle. Every car Tesla has sold since October 2016 has been capable of fully autonomous driving … once the software is ready.That gives Tesla the ability to validate its current and future software using data from real cars, driven by real people, in real scenarios. More important than that, having a fleet of hundreds of thousands of autonomous-capable vehicles already out driving around the world means that when the software for fully autonomous driving is ready, all those cars will instantaneously become the largest fleet of autonomous vehicles with the push of a single over-the-air update. That’s bananas, yo.Tesla Autopilot has traveled 1.48 billion miles (updated estimate): https://t.co/ZOfZn6HlFY pic.twitter.com/7Ze0t7Bft4— Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) October 9, 2018Updated data on total Tesla vehicle deliveries by Autopilot hardware: 443k total Teslas, 279k version 2, 114k version 1, 49k without AP hardware. @elonmusk https://t.co/v34JLgLIyg pic.twitter.com/J0xukW3nMt— Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) October 8, 2018Until then, we’ll have to make do with Drive on Navigation and not let the promise of Full Self Driving get us down. It sounds like a meaningful improvement on the core Autopilot solution and will make Tesla’s vehicles safer and easier to use than they have ever been in the past.

USA TODAYHas Tesla taken so much of the luxury industry market share that its future is assured? One former bear now thinks so.(Photo: Ewais / Shutterstock.com)Tesla may be riding high when it comes to wowing luxury car buyers, but it has fallen to near bottom of the pack when it comes to Consumer Reports magazine's latest auto reliability survey rankings.The electric-car maker came in third from the bottom, tied with Cadillac, in the rankings of 29 brands in the survey released Wednesday. The only brand worse than Tesla and Cadillac was Volvo. Tesla fell six places from last year's survey.The best auto brand in the survey was Lexus, followed by Toyota and Mazda, which moved up nine places. Seven of the top 10 brands come from Japan or South Korea.By contrast, Detroit automakers fared poorly. The highest-ranking American brand, Ford, doesn't show up until 18th place. It was followed by Buick, Lincoln, Dodge, Jeep, Chevrolet, Chrysler, GMC and Ram before it comes to Tesla."The domestics are suffering from a few new products," said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing. He said reliability of some General Motors' redesigns "have taken a tumble," Ford continues to have issues with its latest in-car connectivity system and Fiat Chrysler "remains at the bottom of the list."Cadillacs, for instance, "drive so well" and can "go toe-to-toe" with the imports but suffer from reliability issues, he said. Cadillac was down a single place from the year before in the survey.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Consumer Reports' ratings are among the most closely watched because the publication is notoriously independent. Its reliability ratings are based on what readers say about the vehicles they have bought. When brands fare poorly, it is often because automakers haven't worked the bugs out of otherwise solid new models they have introduced.Tesla, however, was brought down by a poor showing by the Model S luxury sedan, which has been on the market for about six years, said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for the magazine.New features that were added such as air suspension brought down its rating."The truth is the Model S is not an aging model. It's constantly being redesigned under the skin," Fisher said. Tesla, because of its ability to make changes in its models using over-the-air software updates in many cases, experiences "these growing pains differently than traditional car companies."Tesla said in a statement that the suspension issue was due to a supplier issue and has been resolved. It "did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked."More: Tesla CEO Elon Musk touts new Model 3, but it's a bit pricier than the one many expectedMore: Dyson vacuum cleaner company to build electric vehicle factory in SingaporeWhile owners may ding the electric cars on reliability, Tesla, in its statement, pointed out that the same model has been tops among owners in overall satisfaction in a survey by Consumer Reports.“Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues," the statement said. "That’s just one of the reasons why Model S has been ranked number one on Consumer Reports’ owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013, which was the first year Tesla was included in their report."The Model X crossover is worse for problems, Fisher said, but the brand's newest Model 3 car – its first aimed at the middle of the car market – was rated average.Generally, car brands fare worse for reliability when they introduce complex new technology or complicated systems. That was the case with the worst-showing from Volvo, Fisher said.A Volvo spokesman, Russell Datz, said he could not comment until he has seen the full report.How brands fared and their average reliability score: 1.

The analysis of 29 auto brands ranks Tesla as No. 27, one of the lowest-rated brands in this year's report. "While Tesla hasn't changed the Model S in terms of how it looks, it keeps changing the vehicle underneath, so the reliability fluctuates," said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.Fisher added that many Tesla owners reported a number of issues, especially with the vehicle's air suspension system.Tesla said the suspension issues for the Model S have been cut by 65 percent since last year. "The suspension issues that some Model S customers experienced primarily in 2017 were due to a supplier-related issue that did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked," the company said in a statement sent to CNBC. "The issue has already been addressed for customer vehicles in the field and resolved at the source with fundamental design improvements."While the reliability of the Model S has slipped in the eyes of Consumer Reports, it says the Model 3 has "average" reliability. "The lack of complexity in the Model 3 is why we thought it would have average reliability, and that's what our members have told us," said Fisher.The Consumer Reports annual auto reliability report is based on more than a half-million members of Consumer Reports reviewing their own vehicles. In essence, the owners report what's wrong with the cars, trucks and SUVs they drive every day.Overall, U.S. auto brands struggled in this report. Ford ranked the highest at No. 18, just ahead of General Motors' Buick, Ford's Lincoln and Fiat Chrysler's Dodge.Consumer Reports says the biggest issues with domestic cars and trucks are advanced transmissions, turbocharged engines and infotainment systems.By comparison, owners of foreign-brand vehicles reported fewer problems. Lexus, Toyota and Mazda were ranked as the most reliable.Fisher says the Japanese models benefit from management teams that are hesitant to make too many changes to their vehicles too quickly. "Toyota and Lexus are taking a more conservative approach to adding changes to their models, and as a result, those models have fewer issues," said Fisher.Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Tesla drops to third-worst in Consumer Reports reliability rankings - Los Angeles Times
Author: Russ Mitchell
Body: Tesla dropped six spots to rank near the bottom of Consumer Reports’ new-car reliability list. The California electric-car maker came in third-worst in reliability among 29 auto brands. Only Cadillac and Volvo ranked lower.The highest reliability scores went to Lexus, Toyota and Mazda, in that order. Seven of the top 10 brands are Japanese or South Korean. Audi, ranked seventh, was the top European brand. No U.S. automaker finished in the top half of the list.Tesla’s poor showing led Consumer Reports to drop its “recommended” opinion on the Tesla Model S, a car that costs well over $100,000 including the Autopilot feature and other options. The rankings are based on surveys of subscribers to the product-testing organization’s magazine and website.Respondents reported problems with the Model S suspension and its recessed door handles. The Model X SUV remained “much worse than average” for reliability, Consumer Reports said, noting problems with its unusual falcon-wing doors and its dash-area display screen.The new Model 3 compact luxury car was ranked “average” for reliability.“While the Tesla Model S appears very similar physically to the car that launched six years ago, Tesla has made many significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years. Just as we’ve seen with many other manufacturers, major changes and updates can cause reliability to slide. It can take a year or two for carmakers to work out the kinks with new technology,” Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said in a news release.“Making air suspension and AWD standard in the 2017 model has added more complexity and more things that could potentially falter,” he said.In a lengthy response, Tesla said, “Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues.”Tesla pointed out that the Model S has been ranked No. 1 on Consumer Reports’ separate owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013.Tesla blamed the Model S suspension problem on “a supplier-related issue” and said it “did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked.” The company said the problem has been fixed with “fundamental design improvements.”Model X quality has improved, the company said.

Title:     Tesla falls six spots in Consumer Reports reliability rankings - Business Insider

Author: Mark Matousek
Body: Tesla fell six spots in this year's rankings by Consumer Reports of the most reliable vehicle brands. The publication ranked Tesla 27th out of 29 brands with an average reliability score of 32 points out of a possible 100. "Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues," a Tesla representative told Business Insider. The top-rated brand, Lexus, received a score of 78. Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, and Kia rounded out Consumer Reports' five most reliable brands. The lowest-rated brand, Volvo, received a score of 22. Cadillac, Tesla, Ram, and GMC were the four other brands in Consumer Reports' bottom five. Consumer Reports created the list by analyzing feedback on over 500,000 vehicles. The publication said Tesla's Model X SUV was the automaker's least reliable model due in part to reported issues with its falcon-wing doors and touchscreen. The Model X, which ranked among Consumer Reports' 10 least reliable vehicles, was also prone to troublesome noises and leaks, according to the publication. "While the earliest production Model X cars encountered some quality inconsistencies, this is simply not a concern for Model X cars being built today, and it hasn't been one for quite a while. In fact, the quality of brand-new Model X vehicles today is 3.5 times better than the quality of brand new Model X cars from 2015," the Tesla representative said. Consumer Reports said Tesla's Model S sedan had reported problems with its suspension and door handle. The Model 3 sedan, Tesla's newest vehicle, was the automaker's most reliable vehicle, according to Consumer Reports, which said it had "average" reliability. "The suspension issues that some Model S customers experienced primarily in 2017 were due to a supplier-related issue that did not pose any threat to vehicle safety or drivability, and presented itself only when the car was parked. The issue has already been addressed for customer vehicles in the field and resolved at the source with fundamental design improvements," the Tesla representative said. Consumer Reports recently ranked Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assistance feature, Autopilot, the second-best among four semi-autonomous systems, and Tesla topped the publication's owner satisfaction survey in 2017 and 2016. The publication has recommended the Model 3, but not the Model X. It previously recommended the Model S, but the electric luxury sedan lost that recommendation due to reliability issues, the publication said. Have a Tesla news tip?

Tesla shares jumped 8.2 percent in after-hours trading to $312.93 on Wednesday.The performance came during a tumultuous quarter for Musk, who agreed to give up his Tesla chairmanship as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC had sued Musk over his dubious Twitter claims that he had lined up a deal to take Tesla private.More: Elon Musk's SEC deal is a win for Tesla buyers, but could put a dent in his reputationMore: Consumer Reports: Tesla's reliability tumbles to near the bottom in latest surveyMore: Tesla CEO Elon Musk touts new Model 3, but it's a bit pricier than the one many expectedThe Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker reported net income of $312 million in the third quarter, a year after reporting a net loss of $619 million.The profit comes as Tesla racks up cash from sales of the Model 3 electric sedan, its most important vehicle yet because it is the first aimed at the mass, not luxury, market. While the ramp-up of manufacturing took longer than usual for a car company, the pace of production has improved along with Tesla's finances.Third-quarter total revenue soared from $2.98 billion a year ago to $6.82 billion."Sufficient Model 3 profitability was critical to make our business sustainable – something many argued would be impossible to achieve," Musk said in a letter to investors. To be sure, profitability may not last for long. The company is investing in a new plant in Shanghai to make electric cars for China and it is also expected to spend to deliver a new electric crossover called the Model Y within the next few years. Tesla has also outlined other costly ambitions, including production of an electric semi-truck and sports car.Musk said he "recently" approved the Model Y prototype to go into production with a goal of making the vehicle in high volumes in 2020.A more immediate question is whether Tesla will offer cheaper Model 3 versions soon and whether it can continue making money when it does. In the third quarter, Model 3 carried a starting price of $49,000.The company still intends to deliver the Model 3 at its originally promised starting price of $35,000. Musk said it could be ready as soon as February, but the company is not currently able to make the battery pack for it."We’re trying to provide as many affordable electric car options as we can," Musk said on a conference call.UBS analyst Colin Langan expressed skepticism that Tesla can maintain profitability when it begins selling cheaper Model 3 cars.But Tesla said it expects to continue wringing excess costs out of vehicle production. "While the average selling price will gradually decline as we introduce lower-priced variants, we are not expecting this to impact profitability," Musk wrote.The company sped up electric-vehicle production to 80,142 vehicles during the third quarter, including 53,239 Model 3 units.Overall, the total output marked a 50 percent increase from the second quarter, which was the company's previous high.Vehicle deliveries — what the rest of the auto industry would typically label as vehicle sales — totaled 83,500 for the quarter, including 55,840 Model 3 cars.In the "long term," Musk predicted that global demand for the Model 3 would hit 500,000 to 1 million cars annually. The company expects to begin European sales of the Model 3 in the first quarter of 2019 and Asia sales soon thereafter, Musk said. The car is currently sold only in North America.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

Title: Elon Musk's Twitter meltdowns are symptoms of a much bigger problem for Tesla
Author: Anonymous
Body: © 2019 NBC NEWS.COMElon Musk has had a rough year. The Tesla CEO has been dogged by a seemingly unending list of setbacks. There were leaks showing how the company was covering up its high rates of worker injuries, a fatal accident involving its Autopilot driver-assist system, fires in the paint shop and a catastrophic failure of Musk’s plan to automate final assembly of Tesla vehicles — an intricate process which robots can’t easily perform. And that’s to say nothing of the headlines generated by Musk’s unfiltered and combative tweets, including one in which he accused a diver who aided the Thailand cave rescue of being a pedophile.Then on Aug. 7, in an attempt to reduce the mounting pressure from both investors and critics, Musk tweeted that he was taking Tesla private at $420 per share — a significant premium on the market price — without first consulting his board or notifying shareholders. “Funding secured,” he assured his followers via his social media account. This promise, like so many others, was a lie. But unlike in the past, it would have consequences.Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Musk has benefited immensely from a myth of unique brilliance that the tech press and business media, in particular, helped him build. This myth has long shielded him from true scrutiny but is unraveling as Tesla’s problems and Musk’s unhinged tweets have forced a more critical assessment of his actions. Yet as much as he tries to direct the blame at others, his narcissism makes him unable to accept the inconvenient truth that the responsibility is ultimately his own.Musk has benefited immensely from a myth of unique brilliance that the tech press and business media, in particular, helped him build.Let’s first take a look at why Musk’s financing tweet was such a big deal. In the days following his declaration, it became clear that he was hoping for Saudi money to fund his plan; but the Saudis put $1 billion into Lucid Motors instead. To make matters worse, Azaelia Banks, who claimed she was at Musk’s mansion in early August to record music with his musician girlfriend Grimes, alleged that Musk was franticly calling potential investors to secure funding after sending the tweet.Since Tesla was and remains a public company, these actions were illegal, leading the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an investigation that recently came to a close — but not without more antics on Musk’s part.On Sept. 27, the SEC sued Musk for securities fraud for making “false and misleading” statements to investors and sought to bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. But it didn’t have to get to that point.Musk had negotiated a settlement with the SEC where he would have paid $10 million and resigned as chairman for two years, but he was incensed that it would require him not to admit guilt or innocence. He wanted to declare he hadn’t done anything wrong, so he told his board he would resign unless they publicly supported him and backed his decision to reject the settlement. They promptly agreed.However, when the stock crashed after the lawsuit was filed, Musk sent his lawyers back to the SEC to negotiate a new settlement. This time he was required to pay $20 million, along with a matching $20 million from Tesla; resign as chairman for three years; and the company would have to add two independent directors and a lawyer to review Musk’s communications — including his tweets. Talk about a great dealmaker.But for anyone who’s been following the billionaire, this didn’t come as a surprise.Faced with critical assessment instead of blind praise, Musk now claims that the media has been bought off by traditional auto and fossil fuel companies looking to smear him.For much of the past decade, Musk has been plastered across magazine covers; praised as a visionary whose ideas were remaking the world. Yet, faced with critical assessment instead of blind praise, Musk now claims that the media has been bought off by traditional auto and fossil fuel companies looking to smear him. He even floated the idea of starting a website to rate journalists on their “credibility.”But the media isn’t Musk’s only enemy. His Twitter account has become the site of a conspiracy parroted on supportive blogs and forums that “short sellers” — investors which make money by betting that a stock price will decline — are behind Tesla’s negative media coverage and are trying to bring the company down to make a profit. After settling with the SEC, Musk called the institution the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission,” showing the company needs to hurry up and hire his tweet monitor.Musk has been consumed by his narcissism to a degree that any criticism, no matter how reasonable, is an attack on the very core of his being; a fact which has become ever clearer as his addiction to Twitter — and who knows what else — has gotten worse. This week Musk said Twitter had briefly locked down his account because his tweets seemed suspicious. In fact, it was just Musk being Musk.Wanna buy some Bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/9ZbBJ5fuVqBut Bitcoin and Japanese anime are the least of Musk's social media worries. After being called out for getting involved in the Thai cave rescue for good press, Musk lashed out at the British diver who helped lead the successful mission, branding him a “pedo” — slang for pedophile. He issued a half-hearted apology before doubling down on the accusation and asking why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue. What Musk didn’t realize was that he was being sued — the diver’s lawyer had already sent the notice.So what caused Musk to take to Twitter with such erratic outbursts? Banks claimed Musk was on acid when he sent the infamous tweet, and Musk himself admitted that the $420 share price was a reference to cannabis culture. In an interview with the New York Times, Musk denied that he smoked marijuana: “There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.”Yet, in September, when Musk took a puff of a joint on Joe Rogan’s podcast, claiming he’d only tried it once, his demeanor didn’t inspire confidence. He came off twitchy and awkward and later came under fire for smoking marijuana when Tesla’s workers are drug tested and could be fired for doing the same.What is clear is that the pressure from running Tesla is getting to him, but that pressure doesn’t originate with investors, customers, or short sellers; it’s generated by Musk himself.Musk sets the expectations that customers and investors judge him by, but his timelines are notoriously overoptimistic. Tesla Model 3 production was supposed to hit 5,000 cars per week by the end of 2017; that number wasn’t hit until June 2018, and production fell off again soon after.Tesla has also been selling a “full self-driving” package for two years, even though the cars don’t have such capabilities and they don't seem to be coming anytime soon — the option was pulled from Tesla’s website in mid-October. Most recently, Musk promised “full self-driving” features would be delivered in August 2018 — they weren’t — and a planned coast-to-coast self-driving trip was set for the end of 2017, then mid-2018 and now who knows when it will happen.In short, Musk never hits his timelines, but that doesn’t stop him from throwing out new ones that will likely suffer the same fate.Musk never hits his timelines, but that doesn’t stop him from throwing out new ones that will likely suffer the same fate.It doesn’t help that Tesla is currently in "logistics hell." The company can’t figure out how to get vehicles to customers all of a sudden — but don’t worry, Musk has a solution: building car carriers. Forget that the trucking industry says there’s plenty of capacity. Musk’s plan to bring repairs in-house is a similar mess that doesn’t address the real problem. Customers are angry because so many Model 3s are damaged on delivery or have issues soon after, yet third-party repair shops say they could do the repairs more quickly if only they could get the parts from Tesla in a timely manner.When you consider Musk and Tesla’s net worth, Musk got off easy with his SEC settlement. But it seems only a matter of time before Tesla starts to really suffer as a result of its mad genius CEO’s mismanagement. The SEC is reportedly still looking into Tesla’s production output over more potential false claims, while the Department of Justice is still investigating the $420 tweet — the SEC settled civil charges against Musk, but the DOJ could still bring criminal charges.Tesla may be holding on for now, but as its financial situation deteriorates, its leadership jumps ship, never-ending problems keep it from getting cars to customers and Musk’s tweets find the company in PR hot water more and more often, it remains to be seen how long the company can stay the course. Musk assures his followers that nothing bad is going to happen, but can anyone still trust his assurances?Paris Marx is a socialist writer and graduate student at McGill University in Montreal.

Body: Returns as of 6/21/2019Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 6/21/2019Image source: The Motley Fool.Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOct. 24, 2018, 6:30 p.m. ETOperatorGood day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2018 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Shirley and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter 2018 Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk; J.B. Straubel; Deepak Ahuja; and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion's of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and a one follow-up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question queue.But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. So I'll make some opening remarks, then we're going to talk about vehicle safety, Autopilot and Battery Safety and we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. I think there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting, but I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees, and shareholders. This was an incredibly historical quarter for Tesla, Model 3 production stabilized, we delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally, which is more than 80% of the vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. In fact, we delivered more cars in this quarter than we did in all of 2016, in a single quarter.Model 3 became the best selling car in US in terms of revenue and the fifth best selling car in terms of volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business, in fact I think for solar it made them the best quarter ever for solar. We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million and achieved a greater than 20% gross margin of Model 3.Moreover, we expect to again have a positive net income and cash flow in Q4 and I believe our aspirations certainly will be for all quarters going forward. I think we can actually be positive cash flow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment, for example in Q1 next year, but I think even in Q1, I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the Board from sales, production, delivery, service, energy engineering finance and all of our G&A teams, really every part of the business executing incredibly well. And when I think I want to gain probably incredibly hard work, especially I want to thank customers who helped -- it's like many of you haven't heard of this, maybe this has happened before, but I've never heard of it a case where a company's customers actually cared about the future of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company succeed.I think that's amazing, just don't see that anywhere. So, yeah, like really it makes choking out actually. This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9.0 of our software which is the biggest software upgrade in three years and Model 3 received a 5-Star Safety Rating In Every Category and subcategory, they get less probability of injury of any car that the US government has ever tested.Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3's in Q4. And I expect that trend to continue into Q1 and we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year, given that the market for mid-size premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This quarter was an important step toward that and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead. So this was, yeah, just a -- so proud of the Tesla team, our customers really appreciate the support of our long-term shareholders and yeah, just want to have -- I mean half of the Tesla team are super appreciative of your support, so it was actually -- been a very difficult time.All right. Now let's move to, start-up with vehicle safety. Madan, who is our Lead Vehicle Safety Engineer been with company for a long time. Madan, how many years you've been?Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety Engineer(multiple speakers) 10 years.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product Architect10 years? Wow. So yeah, I've been working with Madan for 10 years. We've had so many conversations on vehicle safety, wow, and we're really going to try to go the extra mile with vehicle safety, not just like there is a series of government mandated tests, but you know what some companies do is they game the system. So they know where the side point impact is going to be, they strengthen right in that position. At Tesla, we like, OK, what is the weakest point in the car, let us test with that position. So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti-game the system. Madan, if you could?Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety EngineerThank you, Elon. Just want to give you a very quick background about myself. Like I said, joined Tesla 10 years, I'm extremely very happy to mention working with extraordinary set of very passionate and very hardworking individuals and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us and also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what you want to do is, safety has been -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle, it's not just for electric vehicle, any vehicle period and that's fundamentally differentiates us, so which essentially helps us to keep adding new features and new safety technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3, latest things that we have.Also the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture gives us a fundamental benefit for our traditional vehicles. And that takes here for example whether you have a block-up engine in the front where we can work with using a pretty much open architecture in the front and the whole fact that you have all the electrical and high voltage and motors and all of that, almost below the centre gravity of the vehicle is a lowest probability of reduce the lower risk, that significantly benefit.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectI think potentially we have Newton on our side, and having Newton on your side is definitely the way to go.Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety EngineerExactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3, Nixon did a series of tests, actually four tests for one front, two side and one roll-over test. And if you look at it, we have been calculating how can we distinguish within the five star. There are so many vehicle that already gets five star, and if you look at within the five star (multiple speakers).Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectThat is all the same.Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety EngineerYeah, exactly. So, if you look at there, the metrics we came out with which is a part of US and cap rating itself has a lowest probably of injury and Model 3 has the lowest. And just to give you a context, there are total of 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which have been rated. So, the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the 943 to be exact. So, that speaks the volume and I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved, we are not stopping right now. What we would like to do is next is, how we can make use of the active safety and Autopilot features and make it even more improvement, so the next area that we're focusing on how to integrate active and passive safety, that's our next area of challenge to which we will improve for sure.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, just withering that the safety extends to not just people in the car, but also pedestrians.Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety EngineerCorrect.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah. So, not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful, so because if you -- if a car would hit a pedestrian, we'll get active safety next because the best thing is obviously not to hit car pedestrian, the fact that their (inaudible) can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up being like sort of -- like a trampoline or like -- it has it -- you just end of an rock underneath us, that's very helpful. So, it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car. And then, you may feel how like head-on collision with another car, the extended sort of trouble zone of a Tesla Model S/X 03 is helpful to the people in the Tesla and the people in the other car, those aren't just people in the car.Madan Gopal -- Principal Safety EngineerI would like to add one item which is essentially how we look at the real-world safety, which has always been an important element for Elon. So, if you look at the -- our block force we showed how we handle the centrefold impact in the frontal. By the way, that's not part of NCAP rating, it is just to show we go over and above the NCAP rating to make sure it's real-world safety, that's very important for us.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectExactly, that's what I mean by, we're like anti-damage system like, what is the worst way that the car could be hit? Not just sort of strength and where we know the test will happen and that kind of thing. So, we're all in these cars, our friends are in these cars, family is in the car, so we care about safety, well actual, I think safety is boring, but not at Tesla. So, thanks, Madan. Thank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of who is in the safety team and with that, let's move on to Autopilot and guys can just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware, yeah.Stuart Bowers -- Vice President of EngineeringOkay. This is Stuart Bowers. We'll soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Autopilot feature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks that combine together, provide a view of everything happening around the car. With Navigate on Autopilot, we use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highway system and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a Napf route. Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car moves into an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement they choose to.One area that I'm personally really excited to build on this improvement is active safety. With the advancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this will allow us to warn and even intervene for an enormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software accretes to our existing customers.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWe have a lot of -- we see this whole time in the data, where the cloud will do an automatic braking event and save a pedestrian or another car from impact. This happens all the time.Stuart Bowers -- Vice President of EngineeringAll the time.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYes, all the time. I guess everyday.Stuart Bowers -- Vice President of EngineeringYeah, the team is on a incredible work here and by bringing up more of the cameras around the car, we can detect things as they come toward us, not just directly in front of us.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah.Peter Bannon -- Director of Hardware EngineeringHi, this is Pete Bannon. The hardware 3 design is continuing to move along. Over the last quarter, we've completed qualification of the silicon, qualification of the board. We started manufacturing line and qualification of the manufacturing line. We've been validating the provisioning close in the factory. We built test versions of Model S/X and 3 in the factory to validate all the finish of the parts and all the processing flows. So, we saw a lot of work to do and the team is doing a great job and we're still on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectGreat. And that will be roughly a 1000% increase in processing capability compared to the current hardware and so sounds good, a giant of crew despite being a bump, it costs about the same costs volume and car consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware, but it is a tenfold increment in frames per second and improved redundancy as well. But very importantly, very important to emphasize is that, the only thing that needs to change between the cars used today and cars produced in the second quarter of next year is swapping up the autopilot computer. And this is a simple change that takes less than half an hour and service to upgrade the computer. And one will be able to upgrade their computer to full-self driving capability or upgrade their car to full-self driving capability with a simple service visit. So, we expect all cars with the hardware to sensor suite, basically anything made in the last roughly two years will be upgradeable to full-self driving.Peter Bannon -- Director of Hardware EngineeringYeah, in fact a lot of the cars we're using for testing today have in fact an upgraded hardware too.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectRight. So, it's very important to emphasize that people shouldn't (inaudible) if you want to wait until that comes out, but there's no need to wait till it comes out because it's just a very simple plug-and-play change to get the full-self driving. And anyone who is patron for self-driving option, we'll just get it done for free. And anyone who saw once to order full-self driving at this point, it's just an off menu item, you can still order it. But we took it off the order menu just because it was really creating a lot of friction in the sales process, and people didn't understand the difference between enhanced autopilot and full-self driving. So, just to simplify the order process we switched that off and anyone who asks for it can certainly get it and it really ends up being a discount on future capability. But to be clear, there's definitely no need to wait until Q2 to order a car. We want to make just completely seamless process. So, there's no advantage ordering now versus Q2. Andrej, do you want to --Andrej Karpathy -- Director of AI & Autopilot VisionYeah, certainly. Hi, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy. I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. And my team trends all the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from all the cameras for the Autopilot. For example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on. The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Pete briefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster, but more importantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry and that we see this as well is that as you make the networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increases with the added capacity. So, in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neural networks data work very well, but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computational constraints. So all of this will change with an acceleration of the hardware and it's a massive step improvement in the compute capability and the team is incredibly excited to get these networks out there.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectGreat. Thank you. And actually I said this before when I -- I think soon but, better out in long-term future. We absolutely see the future as kind of as sort of shared electric autonomy, so that you'd be able to do right handling or share the car anyway, you know sort of long-term model that's probably some combination of like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb, they will be Tesla dedicated cars for right handling and there will be -- and any customer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb. So, its a combination of those two models, I think is pretty obviously where things are headed long-term. The advantage that Tesla will have is that we'll have millions of cars in the field with full autonomy capability and no one else will have that. So I think that, that puts us -- that will end up putting us in the strongest competitive position long-term.And then Laurie, can you finish off with -- lets talk about factory safety and thank you for the hardwork of you and your team and I think we made great strides and yes, please go ahead.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyYeah, thanks. We have the safest cars made by the safest people. So it's exciting time here at Tesla. All car and manufacturing factories have injuries. At Tesla, we have a commitment to zero injuries and our target is actually on good reporting. So we have good reporting of injuries, good reporting of near misses, good observations and lots of improvement. So to be the safest company in the world where we have to be committed to that and everybody here is. So we're actually steadily getting there and we're not going to stop until we're there.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectAbsolutely. Yeah, so you can -- I mean actually like, for example we have like some, sort of for example like, we do get these like quite unfair acquisitions for example one of the most like that we are under reporting injuries and it's worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we have nothing to do anything of the sort.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyCorrect, correct. The factory here had a four months long collision investigation and it basically proves that we are recording properly and doing as we as we should be. So it's much different than what you would read about in the press.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, those are true.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyYeah, yeah, I'm very proud of the team for that. It's -- yeah one point I think people don't know is I've been here about a year now, time flies when you're having so much fun. But when I joined we were already really a fraction -- our injury rate was a fraction of what it had been when Toyota and GM ran the factory in the new days. So what we're all about is really continuing to make improvements from there. And what's also important is not to have serious injury and that's extremely rare here at Tesla. We have really strong focus on prevention and also using mitigating controls, so we see these types of injuries don't occur. I mean most of the injuries that we have are muscular, sprains and things like that.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYes, it's essentially -- it's muscle strain and getting scratched.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyExactly.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectBut that's the most of the injuries here.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyYeah, hand and finger cut and sprain. So, I kind of just want to break down a few things that my team is been working on along with all the leaders here. You know first it's people and engagement. So one of the first things is meeting with you, Elon, I meet you with on a regular basis. We meet with all the production leaders. So it's full-on engagement on improving safety. We have built a really strong EHS team, the best and the brightest.We have -- and our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the factory because we learn the process, we may learn the people, you don't know how to improve unless you're out there on the line, on the process, engaging with the associates, listening and learning from our associates. So we have really strong engagement health and safety committees. We do find it, fix it locks or walker -- our leaders are out there walking and also looking for improvements. And actually just this quarter, we had over 15,000 improvements, I mean that's like amazing. So very, very exciting about that.We also look at risk reductions in human performance. People are going to make mistakes, so we're going to design in so we feel safely. We have an early symptom intervention program, this is where we have industrial athletes go out on the line and work with our associates before anything happens. Like if you have a pain, let's work it out, let's strengthen and really get our employees fit.So we're doing that. We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic. So when injuries do occur, we get the absolute best care for our associates and it's actually overseen by one of California's leading orthopedic surgeons. And we did that because most of our injuries like we said like 80%, 85% are those sprains and strains. So now they get that best care here on site and we have 24/7 care. We're actually staffed by three full-time doctors and nurses and I'm really super happy with the care they're giving and I think employees are as well.And the third --Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, we're going to expand on that, so the -- Tesla sort of health clinic both at three months and its sort of -- we have a really immediate first-class healthcare available right on the spot when people need it. And this is not just for workplace, this is for workplace and non-workplace.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyI know that's super exciting.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah. If (multiple speakers) if you come injured for any kind of reason then there is healthcare middle on the on-site.Laurie Shelby -- Vice President, Environment, Health and SafetyThat's where we plan to go, exactly. And then finally just being proactive because that's what we're about, innovation and proactive. I mean we joined national safety organization. We partner with many leading universities including California, Berkeley Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. We do presentations there. We work with the automotive industry and do bench-marking all the time. We're always looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better, and for new technology and innovations and safety. So and with all of that, we have made improvements in our injury rate. We are more than 10% better year-over-year and our last workdays and our days away, but the most important thing is we're also getting all those good engagement observations they're moving up. So injuries down, observations engagement up. Thank you.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectThanks Laurie. We'll provide regular updates on what might there be and yeah our goal is unequivalently to have the safest factories in the world where people look forward to coming work in the morning. So, its like, yeah that's our goal. All right. With that, we can move to questions.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsCool. Well, thank you very much. Sheree, let's go to the first question please.OperatorThank you. Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.Dan Galves -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the quarter, it's really amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for so long. And thanks for bringing some of your team onto the call, it's very interesting. My question is about cell supply. There's been some noise about tight cell supply in sparks and tight labor supply, like in a short-term could you just talk about whether demand is outpacing supply of battery cells. And kind of what's your plan for long-term expansion including cell supply in China?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectJB, you want to take that?Jeffrey B. Straubel -- Chief Technology OfficerSure, I can speak that. This is JB. We have had a period where the supply was fairly tight for Model 3, but it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in (multiple speakers) mybe for a few days. The impact was larger, it felt on the energy products. And that's still is somewhat tight, but we do as we pointed out in previous discussions, we do have third party supplies of energy cells. So that production can continue even, even independently of the Panasonic supply in sparks, so that's been very helpful and that is expanding in future quarters.And also the Panasonic supply is expanding. The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve, with a lot of hard work from the engineering teams and just operational stability. And we continue to bring online new production lines. So even just in the last several weeks, we've started off yet another self production line with Panasonic. And through the end of the year, there's another line coming on and then one shortly after that. So there's a steady increase in the total supply that should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should let us have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from giga locally.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, we are making it pretty nutty around the work, looking around batteries and Martin like -- I think we're (multiple speakers).Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsYeah, so at the moment if you look at for example for Q3 all electric vehicles made around the world, their total battery capacity was about 20 or 19 gigawatt hours. And we -- what we produced in Q3 was about the same or a little bit higher, its about half of world's batteries basically.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWell and is that because we also source cells from Japan and elsewhere because each one is just giga or --Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsSo, yeah, just the giga itself is about 20 and on top of that Tesla makes is, I don't know another four or five.Dan Galves -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGot it. That's a huge advantage, is there plans that you can talk about for cell supply in China? Will that be produced in China, I'm assuming so?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectLong-term it would be produced in China, short-term we're not certain of the short-term situation, but long-term certainly.Dan Galves -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGot it. Okay, Thanks very much.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you. Let's go to the next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- AnalystHey, thank you for taking my questions. I was very surprised in the numbers you reverted today by your gross margin performance on the model 3. So, if I remember correctly you were expecting more than 15% gross margin for this quarter and you actually did better than 20%. So, can you take us through what improved like faster and better than you had initially anticipated in the manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerDeepak here and (inaudible) and others please feel free to join. Our improvements on the cost side were in every aspect of cost. So clearly our manufacturing labor hours improved significantly. Our overall manufacturing costs dropped almost 30% sequentially Q2 to Q3. We produce more volume, so we had better fixed cost absorption. We had wireless craft, our yield on each of the lines across both factories improved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities. We are going through this phase where we are now stabilizing production and the team can now intensely focus on cost optimization. And that trend will just continue in Q4.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectI think we're also being relatively -- on the conservative side when we predicted -- when we said like we're being --Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerOur expectation was, we would do better, but we want to be conservative, you're right. And in terms of our guidance that we gave for Q3.Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- AnalystOkay, thanks. That's great. And then on as a quick follow-up, you've announced although that we can like a mid range kWh is with a smaller battery pack. And I was wondering as you're looking at expanding product channels modestly, I think about it as you had two options, one was to grow and to keep what you're seeing higher end, higher ASP kWh. And the other one was to go for a lower cost car, and stick to the US. So, how did you decide the sequencing of these two things? Why is the lower kWh now and going abroad early next year?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWell, we're trying to provide most affordable electric car options that we can. And so as we can -- we just don't have the ability to get to the $35,000 car right away. We thought this might be a way to offer it as an intermediate step. And that's really it. We expect to start producing a significant volume for Europe in January, and obviously take some time to ship. So deliveries, probably if we finish the deliveries in Europe kind of in the late February, March timeframe, because the people work in California to a customer in Europe. And for us, our car only account as liberty, if it reaches the end customer and all the paperwork is completed correctly. So it's the highest possible standard for considering a sale.Unidentified Speaker --And also believe that delivering cars.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah. We may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1, but certainly in Q2. It will be kind of borderline as whether our cars delivered in APAC by the end of Q1. So I can't say for certain, they're definitely in Europe, but -- and then definitely in APAC in Q2.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsOkay. Let's go to the next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- AnalystYes, thank you. I guess just along those lines, you indicated that you're going to bring Model 3 to Europe early next year. Where would you like to see production in order to support that ramp overseas?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWell, initially production will occur, I mean these last -- take several months of production is, vehicle production take place at our car plant in California.Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- AnalystSorry, I meant to ask, where would you like to see that production rate on a weekly basis go to in order to support that ramp?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYou know, it's hard to predict with accuracy. The -- and there's also to know like what the tariff for is and everything. So long-term, I'd like to say like, we're not talking about like next quarter, so like what it is -- likely global demand for Model 3. It's on probably on the order of anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year, I would say, good global demand for Model 3. It looks to me like say the 3 series one that's around 0.5 million, the BMW 3 Series about 0.5 million a year globally. And generally we find we have to compete the BMW 3 Series quite well. So it seems like logical therefore that we would want to have a higher production or higher demand, they maybe somewhere between the kind of the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf, which is about a 1 million units a year. So yeah, that's why I'd say anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units long-term.Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- AnalystAnd you have to add new lines to support that or are you just going to continue to remove bottlenecks on the existing lines?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectNo, we definitely are going to do local production in China, we're moving rapidly on that. So we're branding to have Model 3 production for the China market or the Greater China market active certainly in next year, it will all be happening next year, but it will be done with a very -- in a very capital efficient manner, much more akin to the way we did General Assembly line 4 versus General Assembly Line 3.And then we'll also have a factory in China -- and in Europe long-term, because it's pretty silly to make cars in California and ship them all the way to Europe that's far. Yeah, its interesting. I'm not talking about S/X, I'm just talking about the 3. So S/X will continued to be made in California, I think probably exclusively here before cars were trying to maximize affordability, it makes a lot of sense to produce those cars at least in the continent where they are consumed or more significant.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsOkay. Let's go to the next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from George Galliers with Evercore.George Galliers -- Evercore -- AnalystThank you. Maybe just following-up on the previous question, is the target still to produce 10,000 Model 3's a week in Fremont. And I think you mentioned in the past that once you got to run rate of around 5,000, you'd be better placed to assess what CapEx is required to get there. So as of today, do you have a better idea of what CapEx is required to get to that kind of level at Fremont?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectI think we are not prepared to speak to that right now, except that it will be considerably less than money that we've spent to get to 5,000 in the first place, like I think quite dramatically less, I'd say like probably say passed like 7,000 units for Model 3 with really minimal CapEx.Unidentified Speaker --Very minimal.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, very minimal to get to 7,000 a week. And then I mean that's really just basically solving improving our time of the existing lines, and we can do 7,000 a week. So and then it gets a little harder as you start to go above 7,000, it would need -- at least bringing lines down in Fremont for significant upgrades to get to 10k. But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amounts of CapEx. But I would say like long term it's -- again long-term, it's something -- if we are thinking these are quarter-by-quarter basis, it's very difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do, I mean, if you look at Tesla's cumulative deliveries over time, just like the cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen. So -- but small movements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss, one way the other, because it's such a steep curve, that's why it's very tricky to predict things on a quarterly basis, but a lot of user if you go out in a year or so. Yeah, I mean, probably long-term it's -- as we serve 7,000 to 10,000 cars from Fremont of Model 3 and then kind of 5,000 to 8,000 in rest of world something like that, this is a guess.Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- AnalystOkay, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, in the letter you do point out the size of the European market for premium mid-size sedans is roughly twice that of the US. Could you also maybe just comment to what your expectations often makes in Europe based of Model S and Model X, do you expect a richer mix in Europe versus the US or is it fairly for EMEA?Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsWe give in zero thought, I mean this is like those not -- I don't know, Martin, do you have anyAll I'm aware of is that because of cold weather, probably all will drive and long battery range will be highly demanded in Europe, but apart from that, I mean, we ultimately have to start selling the car to see what the demand is.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectSo, yeah, I mean it seems like -- it's likely to be comparable to, its pretty (technical difficulty) like price in Europe then most likely to be at least as much the amount in Europe that's (inaudible) like that's pretty safe. But I don't really estimate electric cars that everyone can afford not to sort of mine -- high option value cars, it's like -- if we could produce a $35,000 car today, we would do it. We need more work, there is more work to do before to make $35,000 car and have it be positive gross margin, not we're probably less than six months from that, that's our mission.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsGreat, let's go the next question please.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.Maynard Um -- Macquarie -- AnalystHi, thank you. Congratulations on a great turning point for Tesla. As you continue to scale the business, can you talk about how we should think about -- how you balance profits versus reinvestment, you're targeting sustainable GAAP profitability and cash flow. But I'm curious, if there's a level of GAAP profitability or GAAP operating margin or cash flow you want to hold and then take the excess to fund new growth or accelerate opportunities?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectSure, I mean, maybe to if I characterize that question it would be like, are we stopping new vehicle development in order to achieve GAAP profitability and cash flow possible, will that be an accurate, is that essentially like, the answer is no. So we've made significant progress on the ROI. And so in fact I improved the prototype production recently, so it will be 2024 that's in volume production. We made great progress there, also continue to make progress on the semi and the newer Tesla Roadster.And then actually product them, of course, we are most excited about is that (inaudible), I think that's going to be the next level stuff there. And then -- I should, I want to get mention the Solar Tower Roof, we're also start getting into volume production of the Solar Tower Roof next year. That's quite a long development cycle, because many things it's roof its going to last 30 years. So even if we do accelerate life testing as fast as possible, there is still minimal amount of time required to do that and there is lot of engineering that goes into how do you put on the Solar Tower Roof with and not be really labor intensive and things so.So there's lot of engineering not just in the tail, but in the ways done. And then we've got continued improvements in power vault, power pack other energy products. I think we've got the most existing product roadmap of any company by far. I'm not even sure like probably twice -- I don't even know who would have -- which company would have a better product roadmap or even close, yeah maybe you know, I don't know about that.Maynard Um -- Macquarie -- AnalystGreat. And when you talk about Tesla having its own road sharing fleet or giving the people the ability to loan out their car like in B model, I'm curious if your long-term plan is to build a platform that's going to enable companies to write-up occasions to turn the car directly into an application. And then can you also maybe just talk about that business model, is that should we be thinking more about like a revenue sharing model sort of like how Apple takes piece of revenue generated for applications from iPhones? Thanks.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectI don't know about turning cars in application exactly, I mean maybe or right ready to think that maximizes usefulness. And so if there is a way think of where third parties can do something and that could make sense, but I do know for sure that has a well operated to own right handling or its own right handling service, compete directly with Uber and love to obviously.And -- but then also have the ability for customers to offer their car add or subtract their cars to fleet. So we're company owned fleet and the company owned fleet will just be where there aren't enough customer cars to be length out. So if we find again a particular metro, they aren't customers who are owing to either a car to the shared fleet then that's where we will supplement with a Tesla own fleet. So that's why it sorts of a combination of Uber being and Airbnb. And then we charge something probably comparable to yeah to have that say the works or I don't know we charge 30% or something in order for somebody to add the cars to fleet. I think that's like a pretty sensible way to go.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsGreat. Let's go to next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Jonas -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThanks everyone. First question is on governance as the Company conducts it's search for a new Chairman, what are the attributes, experiences of that person that you think would be a best fare or best value for Tesla?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectActually, I restrict questions to operational topics.Adam Jonas -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystNo problem, yes I do. Can you tell us about the folks who are taking delivers of Model 3, what are the top cars, car models or brands that they are trading in or switching out of how many are new to the brand? That kind -- anything you are prepared to share, and then I have a follow-up.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsHey, this is Martin. So I've done the analysis of all the tradings that we've received and really the only pattern that I have seen is that, it's sort all across the board and the vast majority is non-premium brands. I think that is the number one message is just that more than half of the tradings we received were priced at below 35,000 were new. But other than that, there is no real pattern, I haven't -- always anything toward highlighting other than is just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically.Unidentified Participant -- -- AnalystYes, it's a huge upgrade from (multiple speakers).Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectFor many people it is the most expensive car they have ever brought. And so they are clearly demonstrating with their money that they -- they are willing to spend extra money to get a Tesla. So like Tesla is a sense like mass market premium.Unidentified Speaker --The price log is way beyond the federal tax credit, so clearly there is value that they are proceeding whether it's cost o ownership, whether its sustainability that is the brand and the safety, all of the above is making a large number of customers jump up significantly in their purchase price.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, I mean really I can say, honestly like the top reason to refer a friend by Tesla is going to keep your friend safe.Maynard Um -- Macquarie -- AnalystThat's a good reason and if I can squeeze since I couldn't ask the first one, you could answer. Do you think that the third quarter is a milestone Elon where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital? Thanks.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt, at least that's in our intention right now, you know that may change in the future, but the current operating plan is to pay-off our debt and not to refinance them but pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage for the company. And actually almost to that one quite important thing as and this is quite helpful to have these sort of crisis situations with logistics for example. As I dug into the inventory like basically finished product inventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it was quite expensive in lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciate before and we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factory to receiving the check from the customer, being in the customers hand as quickly when we need to get the check when we give the car to the customers.So getting car from factory to customers to get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car from the factory to a customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we reduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4, so the goal and our promise -- but our goal is to get the average time of a car from factory to customer under 10 days. This is a giant improvement in the capital efficiency of the company, because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of products per day -- cars per day.So every day it requires 75000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10 days is $750 million. And we -- obviously we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of, but the banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle which translates to about 70% of the price of the vehicle. So and we've got this loan outstanding which effectively increase the the COGS of the car and then the lose the company to the tune of 30% or whatever it would be inventory of the finished goods intransitives. So that this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America and then also improving dramatically the transit time to Europe and Asia and this is where we're like having local factories is actually very important for capital efficiency the overall system because I think over time we want to get to the time from a car going from factory to customer under seven days worldwide.And then the terms that we have with from our suppliers are on average just over 60 days. Now our cost inventory management also -- there is a lot of room for improvement there. I think we probably cut that down to a few $100 million or so, two parts or something like that maybe $300 million of parts at the factory. So then effectively what we are going to do is reverse the working capital requirements for company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we grow the more capital we have. This is incredibly important for capital efficiency of the company. it's 19 day, Deepak, is there anything you would like to?Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerNo, I think you are totally -- we're reducing our raw material inventory on one hand by keeping production stable finding efficiencies in their house management and supply chain. And at the same time, reducing the time to deliver the car and convert that car into a cash and that significantly improves working capital.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, it's really quite dramatic. So yes I think it sort of profoundly changes the financial effectiveness of Tesla.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerReduce our inventory in Q3, which help -- we had higher payables because -- sorry higher receivables because the quarter ended on a weekend, we won't have that in Q4. So all of this should continue to help us in Q4 and beyond the working capital gain.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, I mean it occurs to me that even if the only thing like even if this was the only thing that has a different was to shorten the time from factory to the end customer. In any given company that would -- compete all other companies over time it would not be a contest.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsGreat, thank you very much. Let's go for the next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.Toni Sacconaghi -- Bernstein -- AnalystYes, thank you. I have one for Deepak and then a follow-up please. Deepak, the OpEx expense management was very strong in the quarter. I think it was down 13% sequentially and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-year despite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean in hindsight did you get too bloated and needed to get more right sized? And looking forward how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growth on kind of a more normalized basis.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, Toni, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5% to just clarify that first of all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employee headcount, how we benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. The other piece that helped us is lot of our Model 3 spending on expense sort of R&D is reducing because Model 3 is going into production, so Q2 to Q3 we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the sense of the leverage of the expenses can have why the revenue is growing dramatically. So our OpEx will increase in the future, but parse through a rate and we will continue to be really, really careful about the spending and I think there are actually more efficiencies that we can find.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWe are going to find them actually like --Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerSo we will continue down that path certainly.Toni Sacconaghi -- Bernstein -- AnalystOkay. And then so -- thank you for that. And then to follow-up, I was just wondering if you could help us a little bit on the back to the gross margin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car. So you know this quarter I impute that Model 3 a piece where maybe $59,000 and that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about zero. And Elon, I think you alluded to the fact that you know the goal is really to get positive gross margins on a $35,000 car before shipping. Are those all fair assessments and I guess the question is where is -- where would a $35,000 Model 3 be in terms of gross margins today? And where does it need to be before you want to operate broadly to consumers?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah. I mean, it's -- I mean the sound with asking questions of that nature and details, it is a rapidly changing situation. So like literally if you'd ask us in a month it would be different, another month it would be different. There's no question we need to get to a point where we can sell a $35,000 car and where the full account or COGS of the car is let's say, on the order of $30,000 or slightly less than $30,000. Like I think we would want to ideally get COGS of the car of that car under $30,000, that would be -- that's our goal, that's why we're pushing very hard to achieve.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerExactly and it's a matter of time, it's been a significant material cost reduction that comes with smaller battery packs or model service, it's not the same cells that we have in the existing cars, (multiple speakers).Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectAnd then the non-cell portion of the pack is also reduced. With the current mid-range pack ir still has the -- basically about the same non-cell portion of the cost.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd we are achieving massive reduction in all our manufacturing cost for a car, which will continue and as volume grows that also helps us in the fixed cost itself. And so it's same factors that have helped us so far, will continue to help us going forward to get us there.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectAnything you want to add JB?Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsGreat. Let's go to the next question please.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Albertine -- Consumer Edge -- AnalystGreat. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Congratulations. I want just a point of clarification, Elon you mentioned in August the time to get the car from factory to a customer was 30 days down to 20 at the end of the quarter, your goal is under 10 by the end 4Q. Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that an automotive gross margin or is that in services and other at this point?Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's all in automotive gross margin, our logistics cost (multiple speakers).Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, I think it's in introduction inbound, logistics is one of the airborne logistics. Maybe question like for the debt that is carried for that period of time is that factored into COGS or is that --Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerThe interest expense of that -- that's is in interest expense line, that is not in COGS.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectOkay. That's like I think the definition of COGS should probably be important to include anything that's directly driven by volume, essentially that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle. So although that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion probably should be, to take the ABL interest expense and by that, that will lead to the cost of car.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd from a broader sense you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be avoided.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, just essentially cash already increases quite dramatically dilution or leverage outside of the ABL line improve slightly. And then -- the effect of car also reduces, because you do not have the interest expense. And if you have interest expense over 20 days versus 10 days, this is a big difference.James Albertine -- Consumer Edge -- AnalystUnderstood, and I appreciate that clarification, sort of just trying to get at even running a negative gross margin in services and other for several quarters now and wanted to get a sense for when that could maybe drop and start to turn a corner and to generate some profit for you, I understand there's a lot of building out going on for sales, service and charging infrastructure. But if you could give us some kind of clarification there that would be I think helpful. And if you're willing maybe to provide an update on where you stand today in terms of battery costs. I know your goal sort of parity with ice vehicles, but maybe an update if you're willing to provide and where you stand in that trajectory? Thanks.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerI think over time every quarter impressively we will see an improvement in the service and other business, as our revenue continues to grow. And as the size for fleet grows is as simple as that.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectYeah, long-term I'd expect service to be a significant revenue item and to be a positive margin contributor. And it's going to be a function of our fleet size and (multiple speakers), yeah exactly we're under warranty, it is like a lot of surplus on warranty. But as the warranty expires, so there is like non-warranty items then we expect service to positive gross margin.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, and that also includes our used car sales. And our used car sales has been hitting to go and they have a healthy margin. And so that overall business for matured companies is in some cases more profitable than new products, I'm not just having brought OEMS, auto OEMs. And we are at the early stage of our growth and as our fleet size grows there are just so many opportunities in that business that -- actual time as simply say.James Albertine -- Consumer Edge -- AnalystThen on the battery cost and there was a question --Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectThat is the key sort of competitive metrics. So I think it's safe to say, we're much better than anyone else, but refer not to give a precise number.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsOkay. And now let's go to the last question please.OperatorThank you. Our final question comes from Phil LeBeau with CNBC TV.Phil LeBeau -- CNBC TV -- AnalystThank you, guys. Elon, a quick question in terms of as the federal tax credit starts to be phased out, as your sales crossover the threshold, what kind of an impact have you guys modeled into, how much that might slow down potential sales?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectWe don't expect this to result in -- yes that's the the sales tax or the tax incentive in US grossed in half at the end of this quarter, but then we also start shipping to Europe, and as such to Asia. And we certainly do not expect anything that would cause our productions drop a little let's say a minimum of 5000 cars a week.Phil LeBeau -- CNBC TV -- AnalystBut in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it will slow down demand and sales within the US?Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectI think that as we are able to offer lower cost versions of the car that we would expect demand to sustain in the US. I want to be clear like that's not like we're holding back this lower cost version of the car intentionally. Just like -- is there anything we can do to provide lower cost car now and that's where we came out with the depopulated long range pack, just like basically taking -- having long range pack with yourselves, like we really care about providing the customer with the most affordable car that we would possibly produce. So that's our ability.And if we could do this more pack now, we absolutely would, it's just going to take us -- going to -- these three months to get the production going and then you guys fill our production and that production is going to go to -- you are going to make packs, packs is going to vehicle factory, the cars are going to get delivered to customers. So that's why customers probably see the small battery pack on the order of like March or something or February maybe, but something on that order.Phil LeBeau -- CNBC TV -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product ArchitectOne thing its due and trying and kind of like maybe points that are worth very mind, as our quarterly letter indicates, the Model 3 is the most efficient energy per mile electric vehicle out there, because it's got the best efficiency. So, we got the best in terms of miles or kilometres per kilowatt hour. And we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. This makes it very difficult for other companies to compete with Tesla because we own the most efficient car and the lowest cost batteries.So, I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment and we've been saying that for a long time. And then -- their only aim is competitive disadvantage because they didn't -- we try to help them as much as we could and they didn't want to take our help, so they can use a lot of patents for free and we're happy they can use our Supercharger network if they can just have an adapter for our connector or something. We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry, but the fact of the matter is we made the investment in the Gigafactory and other companies didn't. And we put a lot of effort into having extremely efficient cars over having -- having most efficient powertrains and the other companies didn't, but I'm sure they will have a time, but that's what us put us in quite a strong competitive position right now.Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial OfficerFantastic. I think that's all we have time for today. Sorry, go --Unidentified Speaker --I'm just trying to -- in closing, Elon started with it and I wanted to say that from myself personally here. I want to personally thank all the Tesla employees who have worked incredibly hard this quarter and in prior quarters in each and every part of our business. Our results really are the a reflection of the execution done in the company -- by the company and the passion that our employees have to deliver such results despite all our odds. And I also want to thank all our customers and all our investors who believed in us and our product and our vision of accelerating the world's transition to sustain latency. So thank you from my side.Elon R. Musk -- Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Product Architect(multiple speakers) I mean, anybody have any additional comments or anything? All right, thanks everyone. And, yeah look forward to the next call. Thanks.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you.

            Most reliable cars: Tesla Model S plunges in Consumer Reports ranking - CBS News
    
Author: Anonymous
Body: Watch CBSN Live By Jerry Edgerton October 24, 2018 / 1:31 PM / MoneyWatch Along with Elon Musk's botched plan this summer to take Tesla private, the electric car maker now has dropped to near the bottom of Consumer Reports' influential reliability ratings. Other U.S. automakers also fared poorly, all scoring in the bottom half of the 29 brands assessed in the annual ranking, which the magazine released Wednesday. The Tesla Model S, which Consumer Reports' test drivers have praised for its performance, received a "below average" reliability rating. Its overall rating dropped it off the publication's "recommended" list. Model S owners reported suspension and other problems. Tesla ranked No. 27 in reliability, down six spots. That drop likely results from mechanical and software changes introduced in the last few model years, according to Jake Fisher, CR director of auto testing. "Just as we've seen with many other manufacturers, major changes and updates can cause reliability to slide," he said. "It can take a year or two for car makers to work out the kinks with new technology."A Tesla spokeswoman told the magazine that some Model S owners experienced suspension problems, but mostly in 2017, noting that the issue was related to a supplier."Suspension issues for Model S have improved 65 percent since last year," she said, "and we continue to make further improvements."Lexus and corporate sibling Toyota ranked as the two most reliable auto brands, as they have for six years in a row. Mazda, Subaru and Kia rounded out the top five, followed by Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai. Volvo ranked dead last. Consumer Reports said the poor rating is largely due to a problematic infotainment system that is included in models such as the XC60, XC90 and S90. The annual survey collected data on repair problems from Consumer Report subscribers that together owned or leased more than 500,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2018. Here is a closer look at how Detroit-based brands did in the reliability rankings: For many car shoppers, Consumer Reports' reliability testing amounts to a starting point in buying a vehicle. "Time and again, our consumers tell us that reliability is what matters most when it comes to choosing a vehicle," said Marta Tellado, CEO of Consumer Reports. It remains to be seen whether the low reliability score will affect Tesla sales. The company's Model 3, a lower-priced model that Tesla hopes will help it go mainstream, has quickly become one of the nation's best-selling sedans. In September, Tesla delivered more Model 3s than all but four Japanese sedans -- Toyota Corolla and Camry and Honda Civic and Accord.

Title: 
                Tesla hits near bottom in Consumer Reports reliability survey - Reuters
Author: Anonymous
Body: 4 Min ReadDETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) high-end Model S sedan lost its “recommended” rating and the electric carmaker slid overall by six spots to almost the bottom in Consumer Reports magazine’s annual reliability survey. Every domestic automaker landed in the bottom half of the magazine’s new-car reliability rankings, which include data collected for more than 500,000 vehicles. The survey, which ranked 29 brands in the U.S. market, was released on Wednesday. “It’s the complexities that have really dragged down Tesla,” said Jake Fisher, the magazine’s director of auto testing. “The majority of the problems that we’re seeing with Tesla truly are mechanical issues.” The Model S appears similar to the model launched six years ago, but Tesla has made significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years, including making air suspension and all-wheel-drive standard, he said. That can hurt reliability as more complexity is added. Tesla said it had streamlined and simplified Model S configurations, not made them more complex. It also said the issues cited by owners in the Consumer Reports survey had previously been addressed by the carmaker, including with over-the-air software updates. “Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements,” the company said in a statement. Tesla said that was why the Model S has been top ranked on Consumer Reports’ owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013, when the carmaker was first included. Toyota Motor Corp’s (7203.T) Lexus and Toyota brands took the top two spots in the survey, as they have for six consecutive years. The survey results can be found at CR.org/reliability. The magazine’s annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives. Tesla’s ranking slid to No. 27, ahead of only General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Cadillac brand and Volvo. The Model S, which starts at $74,500, dropped to “Below Average” from “Above Average” last year, and its overall score denied it Consumer Reports’ “Recommended” tag. Owners reported suspension problems and other issues, including problems with the extending door handle, the magazine said. Tesla’s Model X SUV remained “Much Worse Than Average” with ongoing problems, including with the falcon-wing doors and center display screen. The Model 3 sedan, seen as key to Tesla’s profitability, debuted with “Average” reliability. In May, Consumer Reports recommended the Model 3 after its latest tests showed a software update improved the car’s braking. It has maintained that rating. Tesla was scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. Other domestic brand rankings included: Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) Ford and Lincoln brands at No. 18 and 20; GM’s Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands at No. 19, 23 and 25; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ (FCHA.MI) Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram brands at No. 21, 22, 24 and 26, respectively. Rounding out the survey’s top five were Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T), which registered the biggest gain, by nine spots; Subaru (7270.T) and Hyundai Motor Co’s (005380.KS) Kia brand.

Title: Can Tesla Sustain Its Profitability Going Forward?
Author: Anonymous
Body: A customer inspects a Tesla Motors Inc. Powerwall unit inside a home in Monkton, Vermont, U.S. Photographer: Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist/BloombergTesla posted its first quarterly profit in two years on Wednesday, October 24, driven by its continued production ramp of the mass market Model 3 sedan and slightly better cost management. While revenues soared by almost 70% sequentially, its GAAP net income came in at $254 million. Free cash flows were also strong, coming in at $881 million, causing the company to reiterate that it would not be raising fresh capital to pay its impending debt maturities. While the results were encouraging, there have been some concerns as to whether the company can sustain this momentum. In this note, we take a look at some of the factors which are likely to drive Tesla’s performance in the near term.View our interactive dashboard analysis which outlines our expectations for Tesla in 2018. You can modify any of our forecasts or key drivers to see how changes would impact the company’s projected results or valuation.Model 3 Ramp Pays DividendsTesla’s automotive revenues soared by almost 90% sequentially to $5.9 billion. The company delivered a total of 56,065 Model 3 sedans to customers over the quarter, as it ironed out production issues, and scaled up manufacturing to as much as 5,300 cars per week towards the end of the quarter. Tesla’s gross margins for the vehicle also grew to over 20% on a GAAP basis, exceeding its guidance. The improvement was driven by a larger mix of all-wheel drive vehicles, which start at $55,000, a premium of about $6,000 over the long-range rear-wheel drive car. Tesla is also witnessing better economies of scale with the new model, noting that labor hours for the Model 3 declined by over 30% from the second quarter to the third, while indicating that it also fell below the levels for the premium Model S and X. There Could Be Some Near-Term HeadwindsWhile we believe that Tesla’s turnaround is largely here to stay, there could be some near-term headwinds. Firstly, the market for the premium Model 3s that the company is currently delivering (potential ASP of over $55,000 over the quarter for AWD models) is likely to gradually saturate, and Tesla is beginning to offer a new rear-wheel drive vehicle with a 260-mile range priced starting at $46,000. A larger mix of mid-range models could hurt average selling prices and gross margins for the company. The company has also indicated that there could be a negative impact of tariffs from Chinese sourced components, due to the current trade tensions between the U.S and China. Moreover, the one-time Federal tax credit that Tesla customers can avail on their cars is set to halve from $7,500 to $3,750 for vehicles delivered from the beginning of 2019, with the credit further reducing from mid-2019. This could effectively make Tesla’s cars more expensive in the U.S., potentially hurting demand.What Drove The Company’s Net Profits And Cash Flows Over The Quarter?Tesla’s net income was driven primarily by stronger automotive revenues, which rose by about $2.7 billion sequentially. The company’s cost of revenues also grew at a slower pace, allowing gross margins to expand. Tesla also made progress in reducing its R&D and SG&A spending over the quarter, leading to stronger operating margins and profits. Below, we illustrate the various factors that were responsible for the net income growth.Tesla’s Free Cash Flow increased to around $880 million over the quarter. While the company’s overall revenue growth and margin improvements were the primary drivers of sequential cash flow growth, Tesla also saw lower capital expenditures and lower payments to suppliers, with accounts payable on its balance sheet growing by 50% sequentially to $3.6 billion.Like our charts?

Title: Tesla — More Than An Auto Company | CleanTechnica
Author: Anonymous
Body: Published on October 28th, 2018 | by Alex VoigtOctober 28th, 2018 by Alex Voigt Apple renamed itself and Tesla renamed itself. You may say, “So what?!” Let’s dive into why this really is important to you. To prepare, expect the unexpected.This is about Tesla, but not about motors, autos, or vehicles, and I promise it won’t be boring.A name is an identity, description, and value. You choose one for your kids, your wife, your husband, your car, and your company. You choose one with care and after a deep thought process. You don’t pick a name lightly and you know there is a good reason why you select exactly this one.The name follows you through your life and you want it to be a good selection for the rest of your life. You want it to be perfect. You want it to fit the purpose.Companies that change a lot of time do should change their name.A name is darn important. It determines what you achieve and how you do it, and it can even make you fail. A name is a mission, a vision, and omission. It helps you to win, fail, or retreat.In February 2017, Elon Musk renamed one of his companies from Tesla Motors into Tesla. That is boring news that many didn’t see as worth reporting. It has largely been overlooked, disregarded, ignored, and forgotten — a boring footnote buried under much more exciting, attractive, and controversial Tesla stories.I believe and will make the case in this article that to rename Tesla Motors into Tesla was indeed one of the largest pieces of news of all, as it was the logical consequence of a profound, comprehensive, and complex thought process about what Tesla really is about and will be in the future.I believe that Tesla is an enterprise that is vastly misunderstood in what it does, what it produces and delivers to consumers. This is also part of the reason why I believe cofounder and CEO Elon Musk is still misunderstood by practically everybody.When Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, most people did not comprehend that it is a device not mainly intended to be used for phone calls. Its main purpose was something else. It just happened to be also able to make phone calls. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. Think about this for a second — what have you used and will you use your smartphone for in the future?You have likely surfed the internet, taken pictures, sent messages, bought stuff, paid for other things, sent emails, played games, downloaded apps, recorded videos, enjoyed movies, reviewed business files, stored energy, charged another device, received advice how to travel somewhere, talked to it, brought light into darkness, updated the software, uploaded data, and maybe you even made a call.Steve Jobs never intended the iPhone to be a simple replacement for your cell phone. It just happened to be a device that could also be used to make phone calls. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. But that is almost a side effect of the more important mission to connect you with your loved ones, society, and the world. It is a device to please you, to create unexpected beautiful emotions, and to make you a part of something larger than you.It is a supercomputer and almost an artificially intelligent extension of your brain, only limited by bandwidth from making you a person with superpowers. More safe, more reliable, more capable, more everything. A new level.Neuralink, one of Elon Musk’s companies, is trying to enlarge the still poor data rate between your brain and your smartphone to help humanity to improve and keep artificial intelligence (AI) under control. It partly already is and will soon be smarter and more intelligent than what humans could be otherwise. The main challenge here is our limited interface data rate called senses, which don’t yet connect well to hardware. A solution could to bypass the slow senses and connect directly with data processing, called nerves and brain. Spooky, isn’t it?!When Elon Musk and his team first rolled out a Tesla Model S, most people did not comprehend that it is a device that is not mainly intended to drive. Its main purpose is something else. It just happened to be also able to drive. And it is doing that in a beautiful way. Think about this for a second — for what have you used and will you use your EV in the future?You have likely surfed the internet, taken pictures, sent messages, bought stuff, paid for other things, sent emails, played games, downloaded apps, recorded videos, enjoyed movies, reviewed business files, stored energy, charged another device, received advice how to travel somewhere, talked to it, brought light into darkness, updated the software, uploaded data, and maybe you even made a call.Elon Musk never intended the EV to be a simple replacement for your car. It just happened to be a device that also could be used to drive you. But that is almost a side effect of the more important mission to connect you with your loved ones, society, and the world. It is a device to please you, to create unexpected beautiful emotions, and to make you a part of something larger than you.It is a supercomputer and almost an artificially intelligent extension of your brain, only limited by bandwidth from making you a person with superpowers. More safe, more reliable, more capable, more everything. A new level.The only real difference between the Steve Jobs device and the Elon Musk device is that one moves you physically, the other only virtually. Both move us and our emotions, both are experience devices designed to enlarge our ability to experience. It is indeed that simple.If you believe this article sounds like a broken record, then you are not wrong. The similarities between Apple and Tesla are obvious and mind-boggling. You can exchange the name Apple with Tesla and the content is still completely true.Apple Computers was for good reason renamed to Apple. Tesla Motors was for good reason renamed to Tesla. Apple realized it was not a computer enterprise any more but much more than that. Tesla realized it was not a Motor company any more but much more than that.Both companies defined and created a new market. They generated a need we did not know we had until we experienced it the first time. Using a smartphone the first time changes everything. Using a Tesla the first time changes everything.Once you have experienced that change, you will never go back to your cell phone or gasoline/diesel car.I started this writing about a name change and ended it talking about a you change.Images by Tesla, Kim Støvring (some rights reserved) and Jose Pontes var advertiser_id = 4; (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Tags: Apple, Elon Musk, steve jobs, TeslaAlex Voigt Alex Voigt has been a supporter of the mission to transform the world to sustainable carbon free energy for 40 years.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) momentum stops on report that FBI probe is ramping up - Electrek
Author: 
Fred Lambert

Body: October 26, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 26th 2018 3:24 pm ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertTesla’s stock (TSLA) has had some great momentum since the company announced a profit earlier this week, but it has since come to a stop due to a report that an FBI probe over Tesla’s reporting of Model 3 production is ramping up. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); On top of Tesla’s already outstanding issues with the SEC, the company has also reportedly been in trouble with the Justice Department.Though Tesla has been rumored to be under investigation for a while.Last month, the company said that it received “a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ”:“Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ and has been cooperative in responding to it. We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that there’s “a deepening criminal investigation,” based on unnamed sources.They wrote that the investigation is ramping up:“Action in the criminal investigation, headed by the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco, has intensified in recent weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission settled separate civil charges with Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the people said.”The issue is reportedly over Tesla allegedly misleading investors regarding of Model 3 production reports.Tesla set some aggressive goals for Model 3 production in 2017, but the ramp-up turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated.According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI is trying to prove that Tesla knew that the goals weren’t achievable.Update: In response to the report, Tesla says that it hasn’t recieved any formal inquiry over the investigation:“We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months.”I find all of this hard to believe. But if it is true, I think it’s stupid.Elon Musk sets very ambitious goals. That’s not new. He knows that they are hard to achieve, but he always aspires to make them happen.I am sure they could find some employees that believed it wasn’t achievable at the time, but it doesn’t mean that Tesla or Musk didn’t see it as a possibility at the time.Interestingly, this report comes just as Tesla’s stock went on a tear following record earnings… do I need to put on my tin foil hat here?Let us know what you think in the comment section below.Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.

Title: 
                Tesla's Elon Musk says tweet that led to $20 million fine 'Worth It' - Reuters
Author: Anonymous
Body: 1 Min Read(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision was “Worth It”. The tweet, sent late Friday evening less than an hour before Musk tweeted that he would take a break from Twitter “for a few days,” was in response to a question from a Twitter follower. The SEC in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed. Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement. Under the settlement agreement, Tesla needs to appoint an independent chairman by Nov. 13. Reporting by Kenneth Li; Editing by Chizu NomiyamaAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Title: Tesla rival Lucid Motors gets $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, goes on massive hiring spree | Thinknum Media
Author: Anonymous
Body: Earlier this month, California-based electric car startup Lucid Motors ($LUCIDMOTORS) locked in a billion-dollar infusion from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. Through this deal, the official sovereign wealth fund of the Saudi government is helping to put Lucid on track to produce its first commercially available electric vehicle, the Lucid Air, on the market in 2020, thus putting it in direct competition with Tesla ($NASDAQ:TSLA).Since announcing its deal on September 17, Lucid listed more than double the amount of job openings month-over-month, which is understandable given a billion-dollar influx in capital.window.embedChart("qrlgrzou6y", false);Nearly every single one of these jobs are in its main location of Newark, California, with only two openings — one for an Electrical Engineer and another for general applications — listed for its future Casa Grande, Arizona factory.In Newark, Lucid is not only hiring more engineers, but also expanding into the next step of its development process: design and supplies to build its first commercial vehicle fleet. On September 17, the day it announced its deal, Lucid wasn't even hiring anyone to manage Supply Chain operations. Today, it's looking for 15 people for a variety of positions, such as Global Supply Managers and Supplier Quality Engineers.And, more importantly for its workers, it's looking into a Human Resources administrator to manage benefits and payroll.window.embedChart("m2cod3ql7d", false);Interest in the company is also growing steadily; while not at the level of Tesla's gigantic social media reach, Lucid saw a follower spike in the days after it inked its billion-dollar deal, as well as in the beginning of August.window.embedChart("dnxr2002q3c", false);Its web traffic can be described as widely inconsistent, however. When tracking its unique visitors, its largest days of viewership were on days with huge announcements, such as the Saudi Arabia deal and the reveal of the Lucid Air on December 14. Essentially, this means people are caring about what's new with the company, but don't seem to be exploring it — read: interested in seeing how to pre-order its cars — as much as on Tesla's website.window.embedChart("mv1iq55c6b", false);window.embedChart("m9ln1s4ms4", false);Of course, with recent controversy over the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khasoggi and reactionary protests by companies over Saudi Arabia's upcoming Future Investment Initiative summit, Lucid has kept quiet about whether it would still attend the conference and about its recent investment. Given that the conference is still happening later this week — albeit without a few — Lucid may be in the spotlight if one of its chief executives rubs elbows with Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) releases Q3 results: record $6.8 billion revenue and turns $312 million profit - Electrek
Author: 
Fred Lambert

Body: October 24, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 24th 2018 4:18 pm ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertAfter market close today, Tesla released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter 2018, which turned out to be a historic quarter.We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results and shareholders letter. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The company delivered higher on revenue with a new record of $6.8 billion. It ended the quarter with a rare profit of $1.75 per share.That’s significantly higher than what the street was expecting.As we reported in our preview post, Wall Street was expecting revenue of about $5.667 billion for the quarter and a loss of about $0.53 per share.It appears that the Model 3’s gross margin, which ended up being much higher than expected, made all the difference.Tesla claims that Model 3 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were both over 20% in Q3. The company says that labor hours per Model 3 decreased by more than 30% from Q2 to Q3.The automaker’s stock price is up 10% in aftermarket trading on the news.This is a game changer. Short thesis is falling apart. Naysayers can't even say that it is because of the credits since Tesla sold only $52 million worth in Q3. They would have been profitable either way. Incredible. Viva la rEVolution! congrats to @tesla and @elonmusk https://t.co/zSCJHbDIW1— Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) October 24, 2018The automotive business is clearly the star of this quarter, but Tesla’s energy business also progressed nicely, according to the shareholder’s letter.In Q3, Tesla’s energy storage deployments grew to 239 MWh and they deployed 93 MW of solar energy generation systems.The company still has a lot of debt and plans to repay parts of it during the current quarter, but its cash position remains strong.It grew by $731 million during the quarter and it now stands at $2.9 billion.Here we will be posting our follow-up posts about the earnings and conference call to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts):Here’s the shareholder letter in full: View this document on ScribdSubscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.

Title: Tesla taxi service in Netherlands wins fight for free, unlimited Supercharger use
Author: Anonymous
Body: A taxi driver in the Netherlands who pilots one of Tesla’s all-electric vehicles scored a significant victory on Friday over the commercial use of Tesla’s charging stations including its high-powered Supercharger network.A civil service judge from the Court of Amsterdam ruled in favor of a claimant who filed suit against Tesla Motors Netherlands BV, stating that the self-employed taxi driver for Schipoltaxi must be allowed the free and unlimited use of Tesla’s chargers, including usage of the often congested Supercharger station at the company’s Amsterdam location.“Car manufacturer Tesla must allow a taxi driver unlimited and free of charge to use his super-fast charging stations, also at the Amsterdam Zuidoost location,” reads the ruling.According to the (translated) court statement, the claimant purchased a Tesla Model S with 85 kWh battery in 2014, with the mutual understanding between Tesla and the buyer that the vehicle would be used as a taxi service. The claimant states, “At the time of the conclusion of our (purchase) agreement, it was expressly agreed at the time that I would be allowed to use all supercharges from Tesla in the world free of charge and without any restrictions. At the time of the conclusion of our agreement, it was entirely clear to Tesla that the vehicle purchased by me would be used as a taxi.”The claimant brought forth a passage from Tesla’s website, which at the time indicated that buyers of a Model S or Model X before January 31, 2018, would have free, unlimited Supercharging that’s also transferable when the vehicle was sold. In their suit against the California-based electric carmaker, the claimant cited an email that was sent by Tesla that would go against the company’s messaging of free and unlimited use of Supercharging.As read in the court statement:In an e-mail dated 11 January 2018, Tesla informed a number of taxi drivers, including [the plaintiff], among other things:” Increasingly, we are seeing a commercial use of the Supercharger (one of the charging stations for the Tesla, where electricity can be charged at high speed, viz.) In Amsterdam Zuidoost. This Supercharger is located at the same location as Tesla’s headquarters for Europe, also service center as well as sales location. This increasingly leads to queues for the Supercharger during peak hours and an unclear, and sometimes even dangerous (traffic) situation, for customers, employees, suppliers and other visitors. In view of (traffic) safety at this location, we reserve the right to change the access for taxis to this Supercharger in Amsterdam-Zuidoost after 31 January 2018, especially during peak hours, from 7:00 to 22 :00h, to limit. “On the same day, [the plaintiff] protested against it by e-mail. This e-mail states, among other things: ” At the time of the conclusion of our (purchase) agreement, it was expressly agreed at the time that I would be allowed to use all supercharges from Tesla in the world free of charge and without any restrictions. At the time of the conclusion of our agreement, it was entirely clear to Tesla that the vehicle purchased by me would be used as a taxi .”The latest ruling in favor of the Tesla taxi driver brings to light a hot topic of whether individuals and companies that have purchased a single or fleet of Tesla Model S and X, under Tesla’s narrative that buyers will have “free for life” Supercharging, can, in fact, use the vehicle(s) for commercial purposes. For the many taxi and livery services that have founded their business models largely around the financial upside of having free fuel, their livelihood depends on it. The vast majority would argue that they’re providing Tesla with free advertising to every passenger they transport, by showcasing the vehicle and benefits of driving electric to a potentially new customer.Other Tesla taxi services like Southern California-based Tesloop, which has risen to popularity among its passengers including celebrity clientele, yet unpopular among some local Tesla owners who claim that the company is occupying much-needed Tesla Supercharger stalls, tout the benefits of being able to drive a vehicle for nearly a half million miles while having virtually no maintenance costs.While the court ruling in the Netherlands may appear in favor of the Tesla taxi driver, you as a buyer or owner, be it for personal or commercial use, are encouraged to look at Tesla’s Supercharger policy through a wider lens. Play a part in the company’s mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market.

Title: VW CEO says they'll have 'EVs as good as Tesla's for half the price by 2020' - Electrek
Author: 
Fred Lambert

Body: October 26, 2018 Fred Lambert - Oct. 26th 2018 6:23 am ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertThe Volkswagen Group has made several ambitious claims about its effort to go electric since it was hit by the Dieselgate scandal.Now they make arguably their most ambitious claim yet: that they’ll have electric vehicles as good as Tesla’s for half the price by 2020. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); VW boss Herbert Diess made the comment on the ZDF program “Maybrit Illner” when talking about the automaker’s electrification effort (translated from German):“Here we come very strong now. We have invested 30 billion in electromobility, we have already rededicated a plant in Zwickau, and we are building an electric vehicle plant in Shanghai. We will come in 2020 with vehicles that can do anything like Tesla and are cheaper by half.”It’s rare in the auto industry that automakers will acknowledge other automakers by name publicly like that, but Volkswagen has been clearly going after Tesla in its electrification effort.Last year, Diess said that ‘ he sees Tesla as their main competitor;’.When talking about an EV that “can do anything like Tesla” and “is half the price”, Diess is presumably referencing the I.D. Concept, which is expected to be called ‘Neo’ (pictured above), since it’s the first new EV they plan to release in 2020.Before even unveiling the concept in 2016, VW announced that it would beat the Model 3 and Model X in electric range by misrepresenting the NEDC-rated range of the Model 3. In a presentation, it pinned the two vehicles against each other even though they are both unreleased yet and they are planned to be released years apart. VW mislabeled the range displayed for the Tesla Model 3. The footnote clearly shows that the range should be ‘NEFZ’, which is the German abbreviation for ‘NEDC’, but they used the only range Tesla disclosed for the Model 3 which is “a minimum of 215 EPA-estimated miles” (345 km) – not NEDC.Tesla hadn’t released estimated NEDC range for the Model 3 at the time, but by extrapolating the figure, it should be closer to 250 miles (~403 km) or pretty much the same as the upcoming VW, unlike what this chart suggests.As for the price, VW hasn’t confirmed it yet, but they have been talking about 25,000 euros (~$28,000), which is less expensive than the Model 3, but not half the price.The vehicle is expected to hit Europe and China in 2020 and come to North America later.VW is the champion of making EV claims, but it hasn’t much to show for those claims at this point.To be clear, I think it would be great for VW to launch the Neo at ~25,000 euros (~$28,000) with similar range and capabilities as the Model 3.I think it can be a success at that price, but I think they are doing themselves a disservice by comparing it to a Model 3.They don’t compete in the segment and it’s not even the same form-factor. It’s no ‘Tesla Killer’.What it can do though is open the market for more affordable long-range EVs, which is something that is much-needed. They should focus on that instead of comparing a hatchback to a premium midsize sedan just because they are both electric.What do you think?

Title: Tesla's Efficiency Edge Speaks Volumes For Its Engineering Lead
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla is aware that new all-electric cars coming, but notes in its 3rd quarter report that more than 15 years of battery pack and powertrain development give it an edge over established carmakers, most of which engaged in EVs significantly later.Tesla's advantage could be worth at least a few more years of lead and the Californian company says that proof lies in efficiency.As an example, the all-wheel-drive Tesla Model X from 2016 is rated at 3.1 miles of range per kWh according to the EPA. It's very good for such a big and heavy vehicle with fancy doors (that delayed the project a few times) and strong performance.Tesla Model 3 all-wheel drive raises the bar even higher to 4.1 miles of range per kWh.In the case of the competition, current and upcoming all-wheel drive electric cars (think Jaguar I-Pace, for example) vary between 2.4 to 2.8 miles of range per kWh according to EPA. That's not even on the level of the Model X.We do believe that the Tesla battery and powertrain package is the best on the market and that's what we also hear from Munro & Associates, which on the other hand notes that the body in white of the Model 3 was poorly designed (here lies the advantage of companies that existed way before Tesla).In the longer term, Tesla and legacy automakers will improve weaknesses and become more similar to each other, just like many ICE models and brands become similar to each others over the years. But for now, Tesla is leading on the side of efficiency, battery and powertrain.From Tesla's Q3 earnings report:"Battery pack and powertrain are at the heart of our vehicles. Over the past 15 years, we have worked hard to make the best powertrain anywhere on the market. By 2016, Model X energy efficiency was 3.1 miles of EPA range per kWh. This is an extremely important metric as it allows an EV to reach a long EPA range even when using a relatively small, inexpensive battery pack. With Model 3, energy efficiency improved dramatically to 4.1 EPA miles per kWh, the highest efficiency for any all-wheel drive EV. To put this in context, our current or upcoming AWD (2019) competition is expected to achieve 2.4 to 2.8 miles of EPA range per kWh. Model 3 has far better energy efficiency while also providing the quickest acceleration (0-60 mph in as little as 3.3 seconds) and the highest top speed (155 mph). Additionally, the curb weight of Model 3 long range RWD is only 3% heavier than its gas powered equivalents."

Title: Elon Musk successfully cosplays as a normal car company CEO - The Verge
Author: Anonymous
Body: Filed under:How long will this plot line go on?Honestly, who needs reality TV when you have Tesla? While Elon Musk spent most of Q3 publicly shooting himself in the foot, Tesla managed to get itself to (quarterly) profitability! I love this show! I only wish I saw more of the B plotline about the people who were quietly working behind the scenes to make this happen while Musk beefed with Azealia Banks.I'm sorry, but the Tesla show is good.Anyway, Tesla’s last profitable quarter was in 2016, but this quarter Tesla made $6.8 billion in revenue (almost nice), and a $311 million profit, the biggest quarterly profit ever. The company has never had an annual profit, but the Model 3 is now popular enough that we might see profits more often. Tesla will also tap into Chinese and European demand, taking orders (and, one hopes, growing revenue) in those markets by next year, according to the earnings conference call. And the balance sheet shows that Musk was right, at least for now, about not needing to raise capital, since Tesla currently has almost $3 billion in the bank. But he also said on the earnings call that that might change.This Week in ElonThis Week in Elon was a limited-run newsletter that is occasionally revived when there’s Too Much News. You can subscribe here.Even watching Musk cosplay as a normal CEO on the earnings call was a fine piece of entertainment, like watching trained circus cats jump through hoops. Do you have any idea how hard it is to train a cat? It’s not impossible, but you need a very food-motivated cat.Okay, it did get a little weird. Musk did say he was getting choked up thinking about the Tesla owners who’d volunteered to help with Model 3 deliveries, for instance. It’s not unusual for Musk to tear up a little, it’s just not normal CEO earnings call behavior! Also I guess I should say I don’t know of any for-profit companies that rely on volunteers to help handle their deliveries. But on the scale of Tesla-related weirdness, this is not very high.Instead of taking the victory lap I’d expected on the profitable quarter, Musk and Tesla’s other execs talked about pretty much everything else under the sun except the exciting new chair of the board who may or may not be James Murdoch. (Yes, someone did ask; Musk wouldn’t answer.) There was a little wild talk about vehicle sharing, a plan not unlike GM’s Maven, but which relies on full God-level self-driving autonomy (dorks call this Level 5). Musk mentions this during earnings calls a fair amount as an Uber-Lyft-AirBnB combo platter, but it never does get very concrete. So, normal for Tesla.This quarter did contain the most-normal-car-executive shit I’ve ever seen out of Musk. First, he announced that the Model Y — that’s the Tesla SUV, for everyone playing along at home — cometh! The final prototype has been approved. There’s also a semi and a new Roadster bopping around in the mix, by which I mean Musk said the company’s is making progress on both. What Musk says he’s most excited about is the Tesla pickup truck. Trucks are very hot right now, actually, in a way that sedans are not. Ford and Fiat are dunzo with sedans and are going in on trucks and SUVs, baby. So the Y and the truck are on-trend. This is… practically normcore.This quarter’s profit win doesn’t eliminate all risks for Tesla. Among those risks: ramping up the Gigafactory and expenditures around more Gigafactories. Expansion is expensive, and Tesla has done it — so far anyway — through debt. Tesla certainly isn’t the only company that’s taken on a lot of debt, but that’s definitely a thing to watch. But the major message from the earnings call appeared to be Musk attempting to straighten up and fly right. His antics — “funding secured,” calling a rescue diver a pedo, having some whiskey and hitting a blunt on the Joe Rogan show — have been toned way, way down. He’s not fighting the “erratic” narrative; he’s publicly ignoring it and making a show of being fairly responsible. This is likely to reassure nervous investors, who’ve had a real rollercoaster of a year.i animeMusk’s good behavior isn’t just limited to his earnings call, either. His Twitter account, which proved in the third quarter to be something of a risk to Tesla, has chilled out. He did get briefly locked out of his account, he said, for tweeting about anime and joking about bitcoin — a tongue-in-cheek reference to scammers who impersonate him on the service. Musk is also soliciting dank memes. Sure, it’s weird for a CEO, but by Musk’s standards, it’s basically normal. How long do you think this plot arc will last?This Week in ElonCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

Body: Musk and Tesla fined $20m each for misleading investors over privatisation plansStaff and agencies Sun 28 Oct 2018 12.10 EDT Last modified on Mon 29 Oct 2018 05.47 EDT Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla, has said the tweet that cost him and the company $20m (£16m) each in fines by the US Securities and Exchange Commission was “worth it”.Worth itThe tweet, which was posted less than an hour before Musk went on to tweet that he would take a break from Twitter “for a few days”, was in response to a question from a Twitter follower.The SEC in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets in August that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had “funding secured”. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed.Tesla and Musk have agreed to pay $20m each to financial regulators and, under a settlement, the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive.Under the settlement agreement, Tesla needs to appoint an independent chairman by 13 November. James Murdoch is seen as a leading contender. Murdoch is set to leave the role of chief executive of 21st Century Fox when the entertainment company completes the sale of the majority of its assets to Disney, and will be succeeded by his brother, Lachlan. He joined Tesla’s board last year as a non-executive director and has reportedly said he wants the job of chair.Under the SEC settlement, Musk will also have to comply with the company’s communications procedures when tweeting about the firm. The SEC charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures for Musk’s tweets. The SEC said the company had no way to determine if his tweets contained complete and accurate information.Tesla last week announced it had made a $312m profit in its third quarter – far more than analysts had been expecting. On a conference call with analysts, Musk said the company had delivered more cars in the past quarter than it did in all of 2016. He also said Tesla expected to remain profitable in the next quarter and for “all quarters going forward”, except those in which large debt payments are due.

Title: Elon Musk Says '420' Tweet Was Worth $20 Million SEC Fine
Author: Anonymous
Body: It’s arguably unfathomable that any human being slapped with a $20 million fine for a bad tweet would ever consider returning to the platform, much less continue to fire off word salad at all hours of the day and night. In the face of any logical explanation, however, one such man seemingly continues to insist that he is not owned.Tweeting Friday evening in a thread about “criticism” and “like” ratios on Twitter’s platform, Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared to claim that his disastrous “420” tweet in August about taking the electric car company private was “worth” the tens of millions of dollars in fines regulators levied on him in response.AdvertisementWhy? The likes.AdvertisementEarlier this month, a judge officially approved Tesla’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it argued that Musk made “false and misleading” statements in regards to going private. In the settlement, Musk and Tesla agreed to each pay a fine of $20 million, with Musk also forced to step down as Tesla’s chairman for at least three years. Tesla was also required to rein in Musk’s communications with investors.This was a mere weeks ago.Remarkably, Musk later tweeted that he was going to sign “off Twitter for a few days,” which honestly doesn’t seem like such a bad long-term plan either. In fact, maybe we should all log off.AdvertisementStaff Reporter

Title:     Elon Musk tweets $20 million SEC fine he paid for tweet was 'worth it' - Business Insider

Author: Troy Wolverton
Body: Elon Musk may have settled a suit filed against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but he's still tilting at federal regulators. In a long series of tweets on Friday, Tesla's CEO called an investigation into the company by the US Justice Department "total bs" and said that the tweet he posted that led to the SEC charges against him was "worth" the $20 million fine had had to pay to settle them. He also poked fun at the SEC's mandate as part of his settlement to get him to be more responsible with his tweets. In response to a tweet from another user suggesting that he had turned over a new leaf, that he was acting the part of running a company that had finally matured, Musk tweeted: "Clearly, you're not reading my twitter." Musk's tweets in August related to potentially taking Tesla private got him and the company in trouble with the SEC. In his posts, he stated that he had " funding secured" to take the company private. The SEC later charged that statement and other related ones were false, and that Musk knew they were at the time. After initially rejecting a settlement offer — and seeing the SEC file civil charges against him — Musk settled the suit. As part of the settlement, Tesla had to pay a $20 million fine to the SEC and agreed to put in place new guidelines to oversee Musk's social media use. If his tweetstorm was any indication, Musk wasn't the slightest bit chagrined by the settlement, which also will require him to step down as Tesla's chairman. As part of a back-and-forth on the site with other users about the merits of Twitter and how relatively few followers "like" good tweets, one user asked him what the ratio of likes was for his "funding secured tweet." Musk's two-word response: "Worth it." Elon Musk/Twitter But Musk didn't stop there. That evening, The Wall Street Journal published a report saying that the Justice Department is ramping up its investigation into Tesla over whether Musk and the company misled investors over production issues related to its new Model 3 vehicle. Musk had said as early as February of last year — months before Tesla started making the Model 3 — that the company planned to be manufacturing 5,000 of the vehicles a week by the fourth quarter of 2017, comments he echoed that July. In reality, the company didn't hit that 5,000 vehicle a week target for the first time until the end of June this year. Commenting on the Journal's article Friday night, Fox Business Network correspondent Charles Gasparino tweeted that proving that Musk and Tesla misled investors would be "really difficult." "Exactly," Musk responded to Gasparino. "This is total bs." Musk even seemed to invite a dig through documents via a Freedom of Information Act request in an effort to prove his case. "The FOIA on this will be solid gold," he tweeted. "Can't wait." But that wasn't all. Earlier, another Twitter user charged that the substance and timing of the Journal's article was "purely meant to distort [Tesla's] stock and harm investors" and questioned why the SEC wasn't looking into it. "Good question," Musk responded. At the end of his tweetstorm, Musk announced he would be "signing off Twitter for a few days." Get the latest Tesla stock price here.

Title: Elon Musk's New Meme Obsessed Twitter Persona Is Also a Savvy Business Move | Inverse
Author: Anonymous
Body: Elon Musk is back on his Twitter ish. But this time, instead of irresponsible accusations or potentially misleading financial statements that cost him $20 million along with his Tesla chairman position, he’s pivoted heavily back to memes. And that’s probably a good thing.On Thursday, the tech mogul tweeted a year-old meme of a man being approached by a ferocious panda. This was followed by a subsequent call to action where he asked his followers to send him their “dankest memes,” which garnered 58,000 likes, 17,000 replies, and 15,000 retweets in an hour.Musk is no stranger to wilding out online, from harmless tweets about lemurs, to downright irresponsible unfounded accusations. There’s some evidence that even Musk knows they don’t all age well, with a handful of deleted tweets to his name (despite the fact that, particularly when you’re Musk, there’s no erasing your tweets from the internet). This shift to memes might seem unhinged, but it may be the smartest thing he’s done on Twitter in recent memory.Fresh puro from my meme dealer pic.twitter.com/EdU5uJVVneThat’s because there’s far more at stake than ego when it comes to Musk’s status as an internet icon with legions of fans. You need money to bring moonshots like a renewable energy future, space exploration, and high-speed hyperloops to light. But the conventional ways of getting money — borrowing it, or raising it from investors — also cost money, either in the form of interest payments or pesky investors who are entitled to profits and can tell you what to do.Selling merch, on the other hand, lets Musk tap cash when he needs to without those two drawbacks. That’s why it’s so important he continues to engage with fans without the risk of drawing the ire of federal regulators: No one wants hats or “not a flamethrowers” in the likeness of a dry, boardroom dwelling CEO. How’d they know!? pic.twitter.com/AZh4EOrgmcThese new memes seem like an effort to set new terms for Musk’s Twitter persona with much, much lower stakes than the fated “going private” tweet without succumbing entirely to the typical CEO social media playbook. Over the course of October, for example, he’s revealed his love for anime, poked fun at horoscopes, and ragged on Fortnite. These joke tweets were sprinkled with the conventional corporate announcement’s he’s always made about things like Model 3 launch date announcements and Boring Company updates. That’s a pretty effective way to engage with fans and keep his feed surprising while still getting them to look at boasts about his roster of undertakings and the various successes.

Title: We need Elon Musk much more than he needs us | TheHill
Author: Anonymous
Body: Heroes are not created equal. Most people recognize the name Sully Sullenberger, but far fewer can tell you what Alan Turing did during World War II.Fewer still could tell you that Turing was chemically castrated because he was gay, and committed suicide shortly thereafter. But thanks for bringing one of the most horrifying wars in history to an abrupt end, I guess?Society isn’t always kind to its heroes. We ask for an ill-defined yet idealized sort of perfection, and when our heroes fall short, we make sure they fall twice as hard.Some might write this phenomenon off as a minor inconvenience for the rich, successful or famous, but times have changed. The human costs of war pale in comparison to the battles humanity will face in the years to come.More so than any time in our history, we are inundated with existential threats to our way of life. The future of the planet depends on our ability to accelerate scientific discovery and deploy new technologies, and that’s precisely what Elon Musk is doing.Musk has committed literally all of his considerable resources, and all of his talents, to addressing those threats. He doesn’t need the money, he doesn’t need the fame, and his legacy is already a lock. Yet, he’s facing a societal firing squad that has decided that he’s too eccentric to be allowed to solve these problems for us.One tweet from Musk about taking a company private, and the Department of Justice opens up an unprecedented investigation into him. A delay in production of a radically new type of vehicle, and his stock goes tumbling.What’s next? Should we dock the pay of everyone working on the Cancer Moonshot for every month we go without a cure? As concerned as I am about the problems we face in energy, climate, transportation and the new space race, there’s one overarching problem that scares me more: We don’t want modern heroes to succeed in their efforts to tackle these challenges on our behalf.Musk has been given every reason to call it quits, buy an island and retire. That hasn’t stopped him yet, but it’s pretty clear the absurd behavior of an ungrateful public is taking a toll. If you care about the future, it's essential to put the work of our future-makers in the appropriate context. Overly eager critiquesFew people realize it, but Tesla is not a luxury car company. The stated mission at Tesla is: “to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.” Consider that for a moment. A car company took it upon itself to enact a much larger societal shift to a better form of energy. The luxury car is just a beachhead market for the underlying technology. And you know what — the cars are great! It’s a phenomenal product, with diehard fans and loyal customers.Tesla could have stopped there and would get all the respect in the world. Even just building a new car brand in this era is accomplishment enough, but Musk himself made the choice to dedicate Tesla to the even more ambitious mission with enduring societal impact. Instead of marveling at the ambition, we’ve fallen into the habit of chronicling the inconsequential delays in Model 3 production on a weekly basis. A recent Fortune article opened with, “Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for setting ambitious goals and timelines for the electric car company, but he isn’t known for hitting them.” When is it enough? Doing it alone The Boring Company is one of Musk’s more recent creations. This company constructs tunnels for his breakthrough HyperLoop transportation venture. But why should you care? Well, the United States doesn’t even crack the top 15 countries in the World Economic Forum’s rankings for ground transportation. And no U.S. city made the top 20 in the 2017 Sustainable Cities Mobility Index from Arcadis. In short, we’re falling further behind the rest of the world with every day that passes. So Musk designed an entirely new mode of transportation called Hyperloop in a joint venture between Tesla and SpaceX. Then, he committed to the engaging students in the research effort to develop the solution and advance the technology.They ran tests on their own, without getting any government funding, and he realized he’s going to have to dig the tunnels for Hyperloop himself, so he started that company too.He didn’t ask for help. State and local governments offered nothing but red tape along the way, but he pushed forward anyway, no matter the obstacles put in front of him. That’s what makes this so appalling. Elon Musk is the modern American incarnation of rugged self-reliance, yet the country in which he operates can barely recognize it and thinks they are owed something over and above what he has already given them.If you just let the guy do his thing, you’ll be traveling between major cities in a matter of minutes. He doesn’t want your help, your time or your money. He just wants to fix the problem. Do you want to get from Dallas to Houston in 20 minutes? If the answer is yes, amazingly all you have to do is keep to yourself.Breaking the curveNot one to limit his endeavors to the planet he currently occupies, Musk turned his attention to space when he founded SpaceX in 2002. Since then, the company highlight reel has been nothing short of a scientific miracle.That reel includes the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to get to orbit; the first private company to launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft; and the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station.Beyond the accomplishments as a private company, SpaceX was the first of any type of organization to execute a propulsive landing for an orbital rock and the first to reuse such a rocket. The U.S. isn’t exactly leading the way in Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, so let’s put those achievements into context: A private company is outpacing all of the world’s governments in the advancement of space travel. Why we need Elon At some point, we have to acknowledge that we need Elon Musk more than he needs us. Most citizens have abdicated responsibility for society’s biggest problems to their government, private industry or some abstract notion of an international governing body that doesn’t exist. But here’s the thing: People who don’t get their hands dirty don’t get to sit back and be the arbiters of the solutions. If you don’t like how Musk makes cars, if you don’t like how he tweets, if you don’t like how he explores space, then start your own company. And I don’t write that sarcastically, I really mean it. We need more people working on big problems. Start a company with an insanely ambitious mission and don’t stop until you achieve your goals. Too many smart, creative people are sitting on the sidelines critiquing heroes rather than trying to be one themselves. Elon Musk doesn’t need accolades. He doesn’t need critics either. But he could use a few tough competitors. And we’d all be better off for it.Ben Lamm is an American serial software and tech entrepreneur and investor.

Title: Tesla posts a profit after a 'historic quarter' and strong Model 3 sales; shares jump - The Washington Post
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla earned a profit in the third quarter, fulfilling Elon Musk’s promise of a turn to positive cash flow amid months of scandals involving its high-profile CEO and federal probes, the company announced Wednesday.The electric-car giant’s deliveries of its Model 3 sedan grew to 56,000 as America’s most valuable automaker surmounted production delays, delivery woes and a federal regulator’s lawsuit over Musk’s tweets.Tesla logged a record $312 million in profit, swinging into the black for the first time since late 2016. It had $6.8 billion in revenue, compared with analysts' estimates of roughly $6.3 billion, and more than doubled its revenue compared with the same quarter last year. Tesla’s share price jumped 12 percent in after-hours trading.The $50 billion car company, Silicon Valley’s biggest challenger to Detroit, has won fervent loyalty from buyers of its sleek, pricey, battery-powered SUVs and sedans. But it has scrambled for years to prove it can survive in a hotly competitive industry packed with cheaper and more traditional gas-powered cars.“Sufficient Model 3 profitability was critical to make our business sustainable – something many argued would be impossible to achieve,” Musk wrote in a letter to investors Wednesday.Musk, who had pledged that a ramp-up of Model 3 production would help turn the company profitable in the second half of the year and squash the need for the company to raise more money, heralded the results as “a truly historic quarter.” The company said “less than 20 percent” of its roughly 450,000 reservations for the Model 3 had been cancelled and called it “a truly mainstream product.”A call with analysts to announce the results Wednesday evening — during which Musk has in the past tussled with analysts for asking “boring, bonehead” questions — was unconventionally low-key, possibly a response to investors' calls for the company to act more predictably and for Musk to be more “grown up.”Musk and other executives said they had made progress on self-driving technology and factory safety. Musk also gave effusive thanks to Tesla’s workers and a group of volunteers who helped the company deliver cars at the end of the quarter: “Really chokes me up,” he said.The company also said it would accelerate its manufacturing timeline in China, where it has pushed to open a factory in Shanghai that could make Model 3s for Chinese buyers as soon as 2019. But tariffs later this year on parts made in China, the company said, could shave roughly $50 million off its gross profit in the fourth quarter.Tesla’s stock price this year has traced a volatile path amid growing scrutiny of Musk, an eccentric billionaire who has in recent months smoked pot during a live-streamed interview and lampooned critics, investors, journalists and federal regulators. The company’s shares have lost roughly a quarter of their value since their August peak.But the profitable results will likely supercharge investor interest and give Musk broader leeway to shape the company as he sees fit. The company’s cash stockpile, which grew from $2.2 billion to about $3 billion, could also ease pressure on the company to raise cash from investors who could help pay for new investments and outstanding debts. Musk said the company, which is making $75 million of products per day, did not intend to raise more equity or debt.Tesla’s growth has converted even some of the short sellers who Musk has criticized as conspiring to destroy his company. Andrew Left — a longtime Tesla short seller who is currently suing Musk and the company over the take-private tweets, which he called “a textbook case of fraud” — issued a stunning reversal Tuesday when he said he now believed the automaker was “destroying the competition.”“The Model 3 is a proven hit and many of the (Tesla) warning signs have proven not to be significant,” Left wrote in a blog post Tuesday. “While everyone is focused on Elon smoking weed, he is quietly smoking the whole automotive industry.” Left’s lawsuit against Tesla is ongoing.Tesla critics have argued the company faces dire threats from the growing pack of sleek electric cars, many of them sold by mass-market and luxury automakers with far more robust national networks of dealerships and repair garages.[Elon Musk taunts the SEC days after fraud settlement, sending Tesla stock tumbling]But Tesla’s Model 3 has so far trounced the sales of rival luxury cars from BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz. Boosted by Musk’s celebrity, the cars’ unconventional styling and high-rated technical features have also persuaded a growing number of buyers to join the Tesla fold.Musk and Tesla agreed last month to pay $40 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit charging Musk with lying to investors when he pledged he had the funding to take Tesla private. Musk also agreed to step down as chairman for three years but will remain chief executive. His replacement has yet to be named.The company has pushed to pivot away from the settlement and return to normal business, including with a surprise announcement last week that the company would sell the Model 3 for about $46,000 — a discount from previous versions, but still more expensive than the $35,000 version Musk had promised would herald the company’s transformation from a luxury automaker into a company with mass-market clientele.Musk said a $35,000 Model 3 may be available in less than six months. “Our goal is to make electric cars everyone can afford,” Musk said. “If we could produce the $35,000 car today, we would do it. There’s more to do ... but that’s our mission.”He also hinted at projects under long-term production, including its Model Y crossover vehicle, a Tesla semi-trailer and a Tesla pick-up truck, which he called “next-level stuff.” “We’ve got the most exciting product roadmap of any company on earth,” he said.The company has stumbled, however, in delivering on some of its most fundamental promises, including the rollout of “Autopilot” technology that would help make Tesla a leader in self-driving cars. The company last week quietly removed a pre-order option for its “full self-driving capability” mode due to what Musk called buyer “confusion,” and analysts now believe the long-promised technical breakthrough may still be months or years away.Selling the cars is just the beginning, and critics point to a series of pitfalls along Tesla’s path to long-term survival. The company has roughly $3 billion in cash and more than $10 billion in debts due within the coming months.JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha said Wednesday before the new financial results that Tesla could likely survive another 18 months without having to raise money but suggested the company would be “well served” by another several billion dollars from investors or financiers. “There is little room for error,” he wrote.[Money vs. morals: Khashoggi killing raises questions in Silicon Valley about Saudi investment]Tesla buyers have also struggled to keep the cars in top shape and on the road, a problem exacerbated by the company’s manufacturing delays and its limited collection of nationwide repair centers. In a new Consumer Reports annual survey released Wednesday, based on hundreds of thousands of driver reviews, Tesla’s reliability rating plunged six spots to 27th out of 29 automakers.Tesla’s longest-selling car, the Model S, also lost its Consumer Reports recommendation due to widespread suspension issues; a Tesla spokesperson said the issue has been addressed in recent models. Tesla’s Model X, an SUV that sells for between $80,000 and $140,000, was also ranked among the “least reliable cars” on the market due to problems including with its upward-folding “falcon wing” doors.Musk agreed to step down as Tesla’s chairman for three years as part of a settlement with the SEC, whose investigators charged him with lying to investors. Another investigation by the Department of Justice is ongoing. The company agreed to more closely monitor Musk’s public statements, including the often-outlandish tweets he fires off to his 23 million followers.The company has not named a new leader to replace Musk on the board, and it has not explained how it will keep a closer eye on the tweets coming from Musk’s cellphone. Musk declined to answer a question about Tesla’s next chairman, saying the questions were restricted to “operational” topics.

This is what makes Musk such a model worth following. Yes, he may at times be self-destructive, egomaniacal and quixotic, but he’s also in the pantheon of greatest innovators of all time. May we all be so bold.Steve Jobs, another flawed genius, might as well have been writing about Musk when he scripted the voiceover to Apple’s iconic Think Different TV spot that aired in 1997. It kicked off: “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.” And its bold conclusion: “Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”No entrepreneur in our lifetime has exhibited as much soaring ambition, guts, tenacity and passion to change the world as Musk. And let’s not forget, his predecessors were equally challenging. Thomas Edison was expelled by his first-grade teacher after only three months for habitually confused, disruptive behavior. Nikola Tesla was diagnosed with OCD, mania and hallucinogenic schizophrenia. Henry Ford, Leonardo Da Vinci and Albert Einstein were all posthumously diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. I don’t mean to romanticize mental illness; instead, I’m pointing out how people have succeeded despite it.Beyond Musk’s undoubtable genius and grit, it takes a heavy dose of hubris to devote one’s life to pioneer technologies that promote the Earth’s sustainability, while simultaneously creating an intergalactic escape hatch if we collectively fail to save the planet. In keeping with the breathtaking ambition of his quest, Musk has certainly suffered many personal and technical setbacks along the way. But despite it all, entrepreneurs should remember Steve Jobs’ words. Bold, daring entrepreneurship is messy. It’s complex. But the crazy ones will get shit done.Related: 5 Ways Dreamers Can Become DoersBy Peter Cohan, lecturer of strategy, Babson CollegeThe lessons that entrepreneurs should take from Elon Musk are clear: Put the highest priority on what is best for your company’s customers, employees, partners and investors. To do that, you must look at your strengths and weaknesses objectively. If you are not good at a skill that’s critical to deliver what stakeholders expect -- now and in the future -- you should partner with an executive who is.For all of Musk’s ambition and achievements, he seems unable or unwilling to do this. Elon Musk is a product visionary who should not be CEO of a public company. Given his control of the board of Tesla, it looks like he will not be leaving the job -- but if the board were independent, it would be replacing him.To his credit, Musk has been able to design, build and deliver some fine-looking electric vehicles and what appear to be very effective reusable rockets. But Tesla needs an adult -- someone like former Boeing executive and Ford CEO Alan Mulally -- to take over as CEO. And Musk needs to accept what he’s good at -- and he’s very, very good at product and vision. His companies, his employees and everyone who stands to benefit from his inventions would be better off if Musk could accept his own limitations.Related: The 5-Hour Rule Used by Bill Gates, Jack Ma and Elon MuskIf you are great at sales and managing people, you should partner with an executive who is great at product innovation and vice versa. If you are good at building a product and winning the first customers for a company, but you don’t have the patience for or interest in building an organization that can repeatedly deliver excellence as the company scales, you should replace yourself with a CEO who can. This is what bold entrepreneurship looks like: It’s not about shouldering every burden alone but is, instead, about maximizing the value of everything -- including yourself.To read more from our list of 2018's Most Daring Entrepreneurs, click here.

Title: Elon Musk was Locked Out of His Twitter Account | Fortune
Author: Anonymous
Body: Elon Musk was briefly locked out of his Twitter account on Monday night because he says Twitter thought he had been hacked.Twitter thought I got hacked & locked my account haha— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 23, 2018There was no news on how long he was locked out of his account, but the tweet announcing his return came approximately six hours after his previous tweet, in which he proclaimed his love for anime.And I own a chibi Wolverine— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 22, 2018Musk is a prolific Twitter user. He takes to the platform to share his own thoughts and updates about his business ventures in equal measure.In September, Musk’s Twitter presence landed him in hot water after he tweeted his intention to take Tesla private at $420 a share, indicating that he had secured the funding to do so. The tweet pushed Tesla’s stock price up more than 6% before Nasdaq halted trading. Musk was later required to step down as chairman of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine to the SEC because the tweet conveyed misleading information to shareholders.After the fine was imposed, Musk called the SEC the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” on Twitter, a reference to his ongoing taunt of short sellers of his company’s stock. Incidentally, his remarks about short sellers on Twitter were those that prompted the SEC to keep an eye on Musk in the first place.

Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he was temporarily locked out of his Twitter account on Monday due to a concern he might have been hacked.Musk explained his brief absence to his 23.1 million followers late Monday night — and seemed to have a sense of humor about it.Twitter thought I got hacked & locked my account hahaThe tweet about being temporarily locked out of his account came seven hours after he posted about his love for anime, and followed it up with: “And I own a chibi Wolverine,” two statements you probably wouldn’t expect to see a billionaire businessman publicly declare out of the blue.But then again, this is Elon Musk.ianimeA Twitter representative did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for more information, but the company typically has a policy of not commenting on individual accounts.Musk has a history of using his account to share everything from announcements about his many companies to personal ramblings. Over the past week, he announced a lower-priced Tesla and revealed that The Boring Company’s first tunnel would open to the public in December.The South African entrepreneur's Twitter feed has always tended to be something of a grab bag, ranging from the serious to the bizarre — and his tweets have also landed him in trouble. In July, the billionaire called Vern Unsworth, one of the British divers helping to rescue a group of Thai boys trapped in a cave, a “pedo guy.” The remark was apparently prompted after Unsworth criticized Musk’s rescue plan as a publicity stunt that “had absolutely no chance of working.”Musk deleted the tweet and apologized, but would not let the matter rest, commenting on how it was strange he hadn’t yet been sued. Unsworth promptly filed a defamation lawsuit in California in September via his attorney in the United Kingdom, where a libel case would require Musk to provide proof that Unsworth is a “pedo guy.”On August 7, Musk wrote on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private and that he had secured funding for the arrangement. Federal regulators said Musk had "not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms."In September, Musk was charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Two days later, Musk settled the charges, which included a requirement he step down as chairman of Tesla for three years and that Tesla “enhance controls with respect to Elon’s public communications regarding Tesla and to pre-approve any such written communications that contain, or reasonably could contain, information material to Tesla or its stockholders."© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

Buzz60A rendering of a "skate" vehicle designed to carry passengers through Boring Company tunnels. This design, planned for a project connecting Chicago with O'Hare Airport, resembles the type of vehicle planned for a Los Angeles test tunnel scheduled to open in December.(Photo: Boring Company)Elon Musk tweeted that his Boring Company will unveil a stretch of a rapid-transit tunnel under Los Angeles to the public on Dec. 10.What the company has previously termed a "test tunnel" in the southern suburb of Hawthorne, between downtown LA and Torrance, demonstrates the company's "Loop" system. People are whisked through the system's tunnels at up to 150 miles per hour.More: Elon Musk says a ride on tunnels beneath Los Angeles will cost $1They travel on an electric-powered platform called a "skate." The device either comprises a vehicle itself carrying between eight and 16 passengers or carries a car that has been driven onto it. Elevators move skates between the surface and the tunnel system. When completed the system would employ a series of tunnels, layered and moving in various directions, with shorter segments serving as subterranean off-ramps. Shafts for the elevators could run straight up to streetside locations, as in a company video, or into homes' garages or basements of office buildings. More: Boring Company proposes tunnel link to Dodger StadiumInformation about the "Loop" tunnel segment's opening came in short tweets Sunday night from Musk."The first tunnel is almost done," he tweeted Sunday night. "Opens Dec 10," he typed to his 23.1 million followers soon afterward.More: Elon Musk's Boring Co. asked to build Chicago high-speed transitThe first tunnel is almost done"Opening event that night & free rides for the public the next day," he replied to a Twitter user's question later.Boring Company's Hawthorne tunnel runs a short stretch from SpaceX property north to 120th Street, then west under 120th "for up to" two miles, the company says. SpaceX is another of the groundbreaking, tech-oriented companies run by Musk, also the CEO of Tesla.The Loop system is distinguished from proposed, longer-range Hyperloop projects. in the latter system air is sucked from the tunnels, which (as the Boring Company envisions) enables pods to exceed 600 miles an hour.Hyperloop tech is also touted by Virgin Hyperloop One, whose board is chaired by Richard Branson, and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (Hyperloop TT). Hyperloop One mentions using tubes whether above ground or below and is pursuing a Kansas City-to-St. Louis route using magnetic levitation to support vehicles in tube. Hyperloop TT recently unveiled a prototype, 40-passenger capacity pod in Spain. Between the constant traffic and pollution it causes, getting to and from Dodger Stadium is no fun for baseball fans and concert-goers. Enter, Elon Musk. Buzz60

Title: Elon Musk says first tunnel for his L.A. transit dream will open in December. Many questions remain - Los Angeles Times
Author: Anonymous
Body: Elon Musk announced Sunday that the first tunnel of a proposed underground transportation network across Los Angeles County would open Dec. 10.“The first tunnel is almost done,” Musk tweeted to his 23.1 million followers shortly after 5 p.m.Musk’s Boring Co. is building the tunnel beneath the city of Hawthorne, part of his grand vision for a transportation network that whisks commuters across the county. Last year, Hawthorne officials approved the Boring Co.’s request to tunnel west from Space X headquarters. At the time, they said the tunnel had extended 500 feet.The company has said its technology could move vehicles, as well as pods carrying passengers and bicyclists, through tunnels at speeds of up to 130 mph.A video simulation released by the company last year shows a driver steering a vehicle onto a car-sized platform on the street, parallel to the curb. The platform, called a skate, sinks like an elevator, then carries the car through the tunnel.In subsequent tweets Musk said there would be an opening event on the night of Dec. 10 and free rides for the public the next day.When asked if the date represented real time or “Elon time,” the entrepreneur wrote, “I think real.”In April, the Los Angeles City Council’s public works committee unanimously approved an environmental review exemption for a Boring Co. tunnel that could run 2.7 miles under West Los Angeles.The proposed route would be parallel to Sepulveda Boulevard, starting at Pico Boulevard and running down to Washington Boulevard in Culver City.The tunnel entrance would be located in what is currently a lumber yard and welding area, the company has said.However, just a few weeks later, two neighborhood groups sued the city over its proposal to fast-track the project by exempting it from environmental review. In Culver City, where the Sepulveda tunnel could end, officials are contemplating their own court challenge. And debate continues over the effect Musk's transportation initiative could have on surface traffic, economic equity and the environment.In August, Musk announced a proposal to build a 3.6-mile tunnel that would carry fans between Dodger Stadium and a nearby Metro subway station.But this plan is expected to face a thicket of requirements and approvals from regulators in California and Washington before construction could even begin.10:30 a.m., Oct. 22: This article was updated with more background.8:00 p.m.: This article was updated with background on the tunnel project.This article was originally published at 6:55 p.m.

Title: Elon Musk’s 150mph 'Loop' tunnel system to open in December
Author: Telegraph Reporters
Body: Elon Musk has come a step closer to creating a "loop" transit system beneath Los Angeles to bring an end to "soul-destroying traffic" in the city. Taking to Twitter, the billionaire SpaceX founder said his underground tunnel for the project "is almost done" and will be ready on December 10.In a follow-up tweet, a fan asked whether the December 10 opening was "in real time or Elon time?" and Musk replied "I think real." The tunnel, which is being built by Musk's Boring Company, will contain autonomous electric skates capable of transporting cars and people at speeds of up to 125-150mph."The concept is that a vehicle would be able to drive on to the skate, the engine would be turned off and the vehicle and its passenger would be transported from one end of the Test Tunnel to the other," according to a Hawthorne council document submitted by the Boring CompanyThe Boring Company's website says the tunnel runs from SpaceX's car park east of Crenshaw Boulevard and south of 120th Street, then turns west under 120th Street, and remains underground along 120th Street for 2 miles.An opening event will take place on the night of December 10 with free rides for the public the next day, Musk tweeted. The entrepreneur first announced plans to bore a tunnel to his SpaceX offices in Los Angeles in December 2016 after being stuck in traffic."Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging," he tweeted at the time.The company is working on other projects including a Dugout Loop in Los Angeles to transport baseball fans directly to Dodger Stadium. Musk is also helping develop a transportation system known as the "Hyperloop," which is a network of low-pressure tubes that can travel at 750mph. According to the Boring Company: "Low cost tunnels would also make Hyperloop adoption viable and enable rapid transit across densely populated regions, enabling travel from New York to Washington DC in less than 30 minutes."© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions page.

A video released by the startup in 2017 revealed Mr Musk's vision for a network of tunnels below urban areas that could carry cars on small platforms – or "Skates" – at high speeds beneath the streets.The Boring Company has also said that pods could be used within the tunnels to carry pedestrians and cyclists, with no limit to the number of stations across the city. It is not clear which method of transport will be used in December."Unlike a subway, there is no practical upper limit to the number of stations that can be built along the tunnel route, as stations can be as small as a single parking space," the firm's website explains."Each station will consist of a bank of elevators and the number of elevators is only limited to the available land area."Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Title: Elon Musk says the Boring Company’s first tunnel under LA will open December 10th - The Verge
Author: Anonymous
Body: Filed under:Go on and take a free rideThe rapid transit tunnel that Elon Musk’s Boring Company is digging beneath Los Angeles will open on December 10th, and free rides will be offered to the public the following night, Musk tweeted on Sunday evening. The two-mile test tunnel underneath SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, is a proof of concept for an underground public transportation system, which aims to transport passengers and vehicles beneath congested roadways on autonomously driven electric platforms called “skates.” The skates will theoretically transport eight to 16 passengers, or one passenger vehicle, along magnetic rails at speeds of up to 155 mph (250 km/h), Musk tweeted.Pretty close, actuallyIn August, Musk shared a photo of a Tesla Model S in the same Hawthorne tunnel. (Questions were recently raised about whether the second tunnel proposed by Musk would be wide enough to accommodate the all-electric vehicle.) In June, the company was selected to build a multibillion-dollar rapid transit link between downtown Chicago to O’Hare International Airport, though the project’s sub-$1 billion price tag has raised questions among tunneling experts. In August, the Boring Company said that it would build a second tunnel in LA to ferry Dodger fans between Los Feliz or East Hollywood and the ballpark in about four minutes for about $1.Last year, Musk said he hopes to connect New York City to Washington, DC via an underground hyperloop and has received tacit approval for the project from the Trump administration. Of course, transportation experts question whether tunnels are really an answer to the quandary of traffic congestion and overcapacity, in addition to questioning Musk’s claims that he can dig tunnels faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional boring technology.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.

Title: Elon Musk Mocks Bitcoin Security And Scams With Tongue-In-Cheek Tweet
Author: Anonymous
Body: Bitcoin is often mocked by the wider cryptocurrency sector for its older technology compared to some of its newer peers and now Elon Musk, a serial entrepreneur who's no stranger to controversy, has lampooned the bitcoin scams that plague Twitter and other social networks.Musk, the founder of electric car company Tesla and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, is no stranger to online and digital payments — Musk was instrumental in Paypal's success back in the year 2000 and his views on bitcoin and cryptocurrency have been closely watched. Bitcoin to the moon? SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at a press conference at SpaceX headquarters where he announced the Japanese billionaire chosen by the company to fly around the moon, on September 17, 2018 in Hawthorne, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Musk last night tweeted a tongue-in-cheek reply to a question on Tesla account two-factor authentification, suggesting he takes the issue of security and scams seriously but giving no details of how he might handle Tesla account security. For months Twitter has failed to get a handle on rogue accounts pretending to be celebrities or well-known personalities giving away bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in return for a small donation. Those that have been impersonated include U.S. president Donald Trump and singer Katy Perry — both of whom have millions of followers on the platform. Elon Musk is known for his candid Twitter announcements and often engages with Tesla and SpaceX followers on the platform.The reply to the Tesla related question resulted in Twitter locking Musk's account because the social network "thought [he] had been hacked," though it was swiftly reactivated.The image accompanying the tweet was created by the website Cryptocurrency Girls, which has turned some of the world's largest cryptocurrencies into anime characters.The founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Zhao Changpeng, quoted Musk's tweet and added: "Lol, it's spreading. I will buy a Tesla if you accept crypto..."Two-factor authentification, something that Twitter users can implement to protect their accounts from hackers, is often used by bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges to help protect their customer's digital tokens. This hasn't stopped a huge amount of cryptocurrency being stolen or lost by exchanges in recent years, however, suggesting that Musk might think more than two-factor authentication needs to be done to protect Telsa accounts.The issue of bitcoin and cryptocurrency scams has led the ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to change his Twitter handle to "Vitalik Non-giver of Ether" to try to stop people from being duped into giving away their digital tokens by impersonators. Ether is the tradable token of the ethereum network.Musk's tweet may have been an indirect response to various news sites last week reporting that Musk's tunnel construction Boring Company was accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for its famous flamethrowers — something that turned out to be false. It's not the first time Musk has joked about the cryptocurrency scammers that follow him on Twitter. Last month, in an apparent compliment to ethereum, Musk tweeted that he "wanted [ether] even if it is a scam."Musk has also previously tried to solve problem, contacting the creator of dogecoin Jackson Palmer.“[I]f you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated,” Musk told Palmer. In responsonse, Palmer was able to create a script to block ETH giveaway scammers.Musk's candid Twitter feed has gotten him into trouble, however. In August Musk sent a now-infamous tweet saying that he had “funding secured” for a Telsa buyout at $420 a share — far above Tesla's share price at the time. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission then moved to fine and ban Musk from serving as Tesla's chairman in response to the tweet.I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported ...

Title: Elon Musk takes on Fortnite, igniting a storm with buy, delete tweet | WRAL TechWire

Body: Select PageElon Musk's Fortnite tweetby Rick Smith — October 22, 2018CARY – In the annals of “fake news,” a tweet from Elon Musk over the weekend may go down as one of the most read.The billionaire CEO or Tesla and SpaceX took to Twitter to take on globally popular Fortnite from Cary-based Epic Games, acknowledging in his tweet just how popular – and often addictive – the online game has come.“Elon Musk buys Fortnite and deletes it,” reads the Musk tweet.“I had to save the kids from eternal virginity,” he wrote.Elon Musks Fortnite tweetEpic’s Fortnite crew wasted little time to respond with a jab of its own.“A whole decade, @elonmusk?” reads the Fortnite tweet response, referring to Musk’s comment about needing a decade to build a base on Mars.“Just build, LOL!”ComicBook.com, offered a translation:“For those that don’t know: the “Just Build, LOL” is a reference to the many, let’s say ‘hardcore,’ Fortnite players who can be found across the Internet instructing players who are complaining or losing to ‘Just Build, LOL.’ This saying, which was a prominent meme in the early days of the game, implies that said player just needs to learn how to build in the game, and that they are, basically, a noob.”The tweets ignited a storm, triggering “hundreds of thousands of people” who discussed the tweets, Forbes reports.Some fans got in some good comments of their own, such as:“All the engineers from @EpicGames who built @FortniteGame will now be shipped to Mars on a @SpaceX rocket.”Written in jest from all appearances, the Musk tweet isn’t likely to get him in trouble with the SEC like his tweet about taking Tesla private did.As for buying Fortnite, could he?Not likely, given the hundreds of millions of dollars Fortnite is generating for Epic and its big part-owner Tencent. Bloomberg now values Epic at $8 billion.“So, could Elon Musk buy Fortnite and delete it? Well, his net worth keeps fluctuating due to Tesla’s stock price, but by last count Musk is worth about $19.7 billion. And while Epic is a private company, the success of Fortnite has estimates making it worth about $8 billion, at least a few months ago,” Forbes reports.“So yeah, if Elon Musk liquidated about half his fortune, he might actually be able to buy Epic Games and then promptly flush that money down the toilet by shuttering its most popular product.”Musk soon returned to more mundane business matters later.“Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 & super simple new order page,” he tweeted.One wonders how many Epic engineers drive to work each day in Cary in Teslas?

Title: Elon Musk Sparks Speculation With Cryptic Crypto Tweet - CoinDesk
Author: Wolfie Zhao
Body: Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, just made a mysterious tweet about bitcoin that’s whipping up speculation across social media and the cryptocurrency community that it may be more than just a joke.Around 22:30 UTC on Monday, Musk – one of the highest-profile Twitter users – said in a tweet via his verified account that reads: “I love anime.”In the same thread, he made another comment around 23:00 UTC, stating: “Wanna buy some bitcoin?” alongside an anime image that features the bitcoin logo.The image was originally created by the website Cryptocurrency Girls, which has turned some of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies into anime characters.Musk’s thread immediately proved popular over social media, attracting over 8,000 likes and over 3,000 retweets within hours of being posted.The bitcoin message appears to have even prompt Twitter to believe that Musk’s account had been hacked, as Musk said in a later tweet:Musk has frequently been impersonated by scammers, who have made fake accounts in order to peddle fake crypto “giveaways” to unaware users – sometimes even via sponsored content on Twitter – and it may be that his tweet is poking fun at the fraudsters.Since the tweets went out, prominent figures in the cryptocurrency community have been engaging with Musk’s bitcoin post.Notably, Zhao Changpeng – founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume – commented in a perhaps half-joking retweet: “Lol, it’s spreading. I will buy a Tesla if you accept crypto…”Dovey Wan, the founder of Primitive Ventures and a former managing director of Danhua Venture Capital, also appeared to be surprised by Musk’s bitcoin shout-out, tweeting:Editor’s Note: The headline of this article has been amended to reflect the nature of the article.

Title: Elon Musk jokes about deleting 'Fortnite,' sparking war of words | Fox Business
Author: Anonymous
Body: Advertisement By Brittany De LeaPublished October 22, 2018FeaturesFOXBusiness'Fortnite' has become a cultural phenomenon and mega-hit for video game developer Epic Games, boasting 125 million players around the world. What is it that makes this game so immensely popular, and how did it come to be?Elon Musk, mercurial entrepreneur and Tesla CEO, took aim at a new rival on Twitter over the weekend – making a joke about viral online video game Fortnite.Continue Reading BelowMusk re-tweeted what appeared to be a photo-shopped screenshot of an article that featured a headline suggesting he had bought the game and then deleted it to save players “from eternal virginity,” adding the caption that it “had to [be] done.”The Fortnite account responded to Musk, criticizing SpaceX over estimates it would take the company “a whole decade” to build its first base on Mars. In a retort, the businessman said, “Reality is hard.”The exchange drew a slew of comments from fans, some of whom Musk also engaged.The online video game, made by Epic Games, has become wildly popular since its launch in 2017. Players are dropped into an arena and are required to collect materials in order to survive against other competitors. Players can choose to make in-game purchases with their own money.AdvertisementFortnite can be played across multiple platforms. The free version, known as Battle Royale, is the most popular, where the last player standing after a 100-person melee is deemed winner.The game generated $223 million in revenue in March alone, and is expected to generate $2 billion for Epic Games this year, according to Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Musk recently reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission – which was approved by a judge last week – over an allegation that a tweet he fired off about having secured funding to take Tesla private misled investors. As part of the settlement, he was forced to relinquish his role as chairman of the board for at least three years and Tesla was to establish a new committee of independent directors to oversee his communications.Tesla’s stock is down more than 17 percent so far this year.URLQuotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Title: Disney World’s Big Secret: It’s a Favorite Spot to Scatter Family Ashes   - WSJ
Author: Biography
Body: Custodians at the Walt Disney Co. theme parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., use code words to disguise the messier aspects of their work from visitors.When a manager radios for a “Code V” cleanup, it means a patron has vomited. “Code U” signals urine.No code is kept more under wraps at Walt Disney World and Disneyland than the call for a “HEPA cleanup.” It means that, once again, a park guest has scattered the cremated ashes of a loved one somewhere in the park, and an ultrafine (or “HEPA”) vacuum cleaner is needed to suck them up.Disney custodians say it happens about once a month.“Anyone who knew my mom knew Disney was her happy place,” said Jodie Jackson Wells, a business coach in Boca Raton, Fla., who in 2009 smuggled a pill bottle containing her mother’s ashes into Walt Disney World.Once inside, Ms. Wells helped spread ashes on the platform of It’s a Small World near a head-spinning bird, a moment in the ride that always made her mother laugh. Later in the day, overcome with grief, Ms. Wells hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella’s castle and ran across the grass, flinging them as she crossed.“I had two fistfuls of the ashes and I literally leapt like I was a dancer,” she said.Current and former custodians at Disney parks say identifying and vacuuming up human ashes is a signature and secret part of working at the Happiest Place on Earth. It is grisly work for them, but a cathartic release for the bereaved, who say treating Disney parks as a final resting place is the ultimate tribute to ardent fans.Human ashes have been spread in flower beds, on bushes and on Magic Kingdom lawns; outside the park gates and during fireworks displays; on Pirates of the Caribbean and in the moat underneath the flying elephants of the Dumbo ride. Most frequently of all, according to custodians and park workers, they’ve been dispersed throughout the Haunted Mansion, the 49-year-old attraction featuring an eerie old estate full of imaginary ghosts.“The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny,” said one Disneyland custodian.A Disney spokeswoman said, “this type of behavior is strictly prohibited and unlawful. Guests who attempt to do so will be escorted off property.”Disney does everything it can to keep morbid thoughts out of its parks. When Walt Disney World began installing personalized commemorative bricks in 1994, the company banned the words “In Memory Of,” worried they would remind guests of death. Caryn Reker of Jacksonville, Fla., remembers her father growing emotional while watching the Wishes fireworks show outside the ice-cream parlor on Disney World’s Main Street. When time came for her to spread his ashes, in 2006, she opted to do it in numerous spots around the area.“It’s a sweet way to giggle and remember—he’s here. . . and there. . . and a little over there. . . yep, there, too,” she wrote in an email. She returned to Disney World last week to spread the ashes of her brother, an Epcot enthusiast who died this year. Alex Perone, an actor from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., described an emotional roller coaster when he took the ashes of his mother, Sandie Perone, to Walt Disney World this past June. Immediately after spreading them in a Magic Kingdom flower bed, he went on It’s a Small World.“I was still crying. That song is playing over and over again, and there are those happy little animatronic things,” he said. “I remember thinking, ‘This is weird.’ ”Among a select group of Disney obsessives, the parks are also places to propose, get married and celebrate birthdays. It is no surprise, then, that some want to spend eternity there.Smugglers say getting the ashes past security is easy if they are transported in prescription-pill bottles or makeup compacts. Others hide Ziploc bags at the bottom of a purse or knapsack.When ash residue is discovered on a ride, Disney workers tell guests they must shut down due to “technical difficulties.” Then, a manager rides alone through the attraction looking for any ash piles while colleagues may hand out “Fast Passes” to assuage guests who must leave before the custodians turn up with their high-powered vacuums.One former Disney employee said she and others got in trouble after they coined their own term for the ash cleanup: “Code Grandma.”There have been false alarms.“One time it was funnel-cake powder,” the former employee said. Sgt. Daron Wyatt, a spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department, said spreading ashes without permission is a misdemeanor. Officers “have responded on calls for service regarding ashes” at Disneyland, he added, but said the park’s on-site sergeant couldn’t recall any arrests being made.It’s likely many ashes never get spotted by park employees. None of the families interviewed by The Wall Street Journal believe workers noticed them in the act. Shanon Himebrook, a 41-year-old state-government employee from Kansas City, Mo., grew up making summer trips to Disney World with her father, a worker at a plastic factory in Indiana.At Disney, “he wasn’t my tired, graveyard-shift Dad,” she said. “He was, ‘Let’s get you the Mouse ears! Let’s get your name stitched in it!’ It’s like, ‘I love this dad! Can we stay forever?’ ”Ms. Himebrook spread his ashes earlier this year near the park gates. Marty Lurie, an Amazon.com Inc. employee in San Bernardino, Calif., took the ashes of his father’s partner, Robin Milnes, to Disney World in eight baggies hidden at the bottom of a camera bag in 1996. His father, who had been in a depression following Mr. Milnes’s death from AIDS, came along but was reluctant to join in.To cheer him up, Mr. Lurie had the group stop for photos with characters including Mickey Mouse and Goofy, posing with the camera bag containing Mr. Milnes’s ashes conspicuously center stage in each picture.He even took the ashes on rides. “You want to go on this ride, Robin?” he’d ask the bag.His father, who died in 2010, got in on the fun. “He wound up having the time of his life,” said Mr. Lurie. Kym Pessolano DeBarth, a 47-year-old optometrist-office worker from Northfield, N.J., dumped a small amount of her mother’s ashes in the water underneath It’s a Small World. “I didn’t want to clog the filter,” she said.In December, she’ll return to the park to commemorate the 15th anniversary of her mother’s death.“Instead of going to a grave,” she said, “I go to Disney World.” Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.comFans say treating the parks as a final resting place is the ultimate tribute, assuming they can sneak the remains past securityAn error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toWSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreCopyright © 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Title: The Urban Legend About Scattering Human Ashes at Disney Is True, and It's Worse Than We Thought
Author: Anonymous
Body: For at least 11 years, an unnerving story has made the rounds on Disney fan blogs: people regularly scatter the ashes of loved ones at Disneyland and Disney World. Well, today, the Wall Street Journal has confirmed the urban legend. And we’re not talking about a couple of isolated cases. This happens on a monthly basis. Disney employees even have a special code to report when it happens.The code is “HEPA cleanup.” You’ll know that acronym if you’re a vacuum enthusiast because it refers to a special kind of filter you need to suck up very fine particles, like human ashes. For its recent report, the Journal talked to custodians of the park who have taken part in cleaning up human remains as well as at least three families who have spread them. It’s worth quoting this part at length:Current and former custodians at Disney parks say identifying and vacuuming up human ashes is a signature and secret part of working at the Happiest Place on Earth. It is grisly work for them, but a cathartic release for the bereaved, who say treating Disney parks as a final resting place is the ultimate tribute to ardent fans.AdvertisementThe Journal report continues with more specific details:Human ashes have been spread in flower beds, on bushes and on Magic Kingdom lawns; outside the park gates and during fireworks displays; on Pirates of the Caribbean and in the moat underneath the flying elephants of the Dumbo ride. Most frequently of all, according to custodians and park workers, they’ve been dispersed throughout the Haunted Mansion, the 49-year-old attraction featuring an eerie old estate full of imaginary ghosts.“The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny,” said one Disneyland custodian.AdvertisementOne can only wonder if the hope of being laid to rest in the Haunted Mansion will turn them into a ghost so that they can live at Disneyland forever. However, the truth of the matter is more somber. Some people agree to spread their loved ones’ ashes at Disney parks, so that they can feel like they’re enjoying the place with them one more time.Apparently, sneaking human remains into a Disney park isn’t all that hard. Families who have done it told the Journal that they put the ashes into prescription pill bottles or makeup compacts. A Ziploc bag hidden at the bottom of a purse will also work. Once there, it’s just a matter of spreading the remains at the right spot and hoping the custodians don’t catch you. If they do, the park staff simply sucks them up with their special HEPA vacuums. Getting caught in the act will also get you kicked out of the park.Advertisement“This type of behavior is strictly prohibited and unlawful,” a Disney spokeswoman told the Journal. “Guests who attempt to do so will be escorted off property.”While this latest report sheds new light on the particulars of this process, the idea that it’s been happening has been around for years. Back in 2007, reports of spreading ashes at Disneyland surfaced online. Police even showed up at the Anaheim park, the Los Angeles Times reported, after witnesses saw a guest “sprinkling an unidentified substance into the water” of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. This drew attention to an incident documented in the book Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at Disneyland by David Koenig. A Times reporter recounted the 2002 incident on the Haunted Mansion ride:The group requested a little extra time for a quick memorial service for a 7-year-old boy who had died, the employee said, according to Koenig.But later, ride operators spotted one of the guests throwing a powdery substance off her “Doom Buggy.”After the ride was shut down, the employee discovered “a smattering of dust, ‘gray, like ash,’ “ Koenig wrote.AdvertisementIt’s all very sad. But it’s also surely frowned upon to scatter human remains in very public places, especially amusement parks.So if you’re thinking about spreading a loved one’s ashes at Disneyland or Disney World, just realize that the parks know about this sort of thing. They’re prepared for it. There’s a process. And when all is said and done, the human ashes you left at the Happiest Place on Earth will probably just end up in the trash.AdvertisementSenior editor at Gizmodo.PGP Fingerprint: 91CF B387 7B38 148C DDD6 38D2 6CBC 1E46 1DBF 22A8 • PGP KeyOTR Fingerprint: D9330D9B 6CF5E271 7FAC6194 DAA9B51B E09A99B2

Title: Disney is a favorite dumping ground for cremated ashes: report - Orlando Sentinel
Author: David Whitley
Body: Some people literally want to spend eternity at Walt Disney World. The park would prefer they didn’t.It has long waged a quiet but steady battle to keep people from scattering the cremated remains of loved ones, according to the Wall Street Journal.Considering ashes are spread at football stadiums, mountain tops and even in outer space, it’s not shocking that it would occur at the Country Bear Jamboree.What’s surprising is how the extent of ash-spreading and how Disney so efficiently combats the problem. According to the story, you’ll know the Ash Patrol has kicked into gear if you overhear “HEPA cleanup” over a walkie-talkie. That is code for dispatching an ultrafine “HEPA” vacuum cleaner to suck up a loved one’s remains and should not be confused with a Code V (vomit cleanup) or Code U (urine cleanup).A Disney spokeswoman told the Journal that ash-spreading is “strictly prohibited and unlawful. Guests who attempt to do so will be escorted off property.”There are no records on how many people have been kicked out, but it doesn’t seem that the prohibition is much of a deterrent, according to the article.The Journal reported that ashes have spread all over the park. The most popular spot is, appropriately enough, the Haunted Mansion.“The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes it’s not even funny,” a custodian told the Journal.The paper rounded up a bunch of ash-spreaders with stories of how they managed to perform the memorial deed.The most famous dearly departed at the park, though, could be Walt Disney himself, if you believe urban legends.The official story is Disney was cremated after his death of cancer in 1966 and his ashes scattered at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.The popular myth is that he was cryogenically frozen and buried under the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, though he may have been relocated to Cinderella Castle outside Orlando.If that’s the case, at least he didn’t have to skirt security like the average visitor/mourner. Smugglers told the Journal they’ve hidden ashes in makeup compacts, pill bottles, camera cases and Ziploc bags.Contrary to what you might have heard, Walt Disney might not be spending eternity at his park. But as long as they escape the HEPA vacuum, a lot of his guests are.You can read the full story at the Wall Street Journal.

Custodians at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, claim the famous parks are a preferred place for guests to scatter their loved ones' ashes, according to the Wall Street Journal. In fact, the outlet reports it's so popular that the occasion warrants it's own code: HEPA cleanup. The special cipher, which refers to the use of an ultrafine vacuum cleaner, is used at least once a month, custodians told the Journal. Which leads to visions of Grandma or Grandpa spending eternity inside a Hoover. Guests reportedly sneak in their family members' ashes in plastic bags or pill bottles hidden inside purses or backpacks. Once inside, visitors spread them throughout landscaping in the park, flower beds and water rides, including Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a Small World.

Title: Guests Sprinkle Family Members' Ashes at Disney Theme Parks | PEOPLE.com

Body: From marriages to proposals to birthdays, Disney theme parks are normally a place to rejoice. But it turns out many people want to mourn there, as well From weddings to proposals to birthdays, Disney theme parks are normally a place to rejoice. But it turns out many people use them to mourn, as well.According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, guests often visit Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland in Anaheim, California, with the intention of sprinkling a loved one’s ashes around the park. In fact, it happens so often — about once a month, reportedly — that custodians have a special code name for handling it.It’s referred to as a “HEPA cleanup,” which, sources told the outlet, references the ultra-fine vacuum needed to suck the ashes up.RELATED: Disney-Loving Couple Visits All 6 Theme Parks in 1 Day: ‘It’s Just Been a Dream Come True’It’s technically a misdemeanor to spread cremated remains anywhere without permission — “this type of behavior is strictly prohibited and unlawful. Guests who attempt to do so will be escorted off property,” a Disney rep told the Journal — but those who’ve done so say it’s actually pretty easy.One woman, Jodie Jackson Wells, recalled packing her mother’s ashes into a pill bottle. Others have used makeup compacts and hidden a Ziploc at the bottom of their bag.“Anyone who knew my mom knew Disney was her happy place,” Wells said of her decision to the Journal. “I had two fistfuls of the ashes and I literally leapt like I was a dancer.”The most popular final resting places within the parks are flower beds and bushes, Magic Kingdom lawns, outside the park gates, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, the moat underneath the flying elephants of the Dumbo ride — and above all, the Haunted Mansion, according to the outlet.RELATED: Disney World Announces New ‘Nature-Inspired’ Resort to Open in 2022: Everything to Know Now“The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny,” one custodian explained to the Journal.When ashes are discovered, the attraction has to be closed because of “technical difficulties,” the outlet reported. Someone then has to ride through it alone and sweep up any and all ashes. The good news? The guests who are forced to relinquish their place in line are often gifted Fast Passes.RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Takes Saint and North to Disneyland — See the Cute Mommy-and-Me SnapsThere are other substances around the park that often get mistaken for an informal burial — like funnel cake residue, for example — and much of the ashes that do get sprinkled likely don’t get cleaned up, at least not right away. None of the people the Journal talked to believed custodians saw them dispersing the ashes.Reps from Walt Disney World did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Daron Wyatt told the Wall Street Journal that spreading ashes at the popular theme park is considered a misdemeanor and confirmed officers have responded to calls “regarding ashes” at Disneyland before.Typically guests sneak in the contraband in pill-bottles or plastic bag hidden in purses or backpacks, the Journal reports. When inside, guests secretly sprinkle their loved ones throughout the park.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSThough there are no confirmed reports of anyone being caught in the act, once ash residue is discovered on a ride, Disney workers are reportedly forced to shut down the ride and inform guests there have been “technical difficulties.” Managers then allegedly ride through and look for evidence of ashes, while employees turn people away before custodians come in with the vacuums.It should come as no surprise that the Disney parks attract people who want to spend eternity at the Happiest Place on Earth — the locations are also popular spots for other big life moments like proposals, weddings and birthdays.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Body: This house on the market in Florida is as close as you can get to living in Disney World Although you can’t actually live inside a Disney park, one house on the market in Florida comes about as close as you can get.This Palm Bay estate is located about an hour away from the Orlando’s Walt Disney World, but it’s decorated with more than a touch of Disney magic. The 5-bedroom, 6-bathroom home is situated on an eight-acre lot, and comes with the opportunity to purchase the adjacent ten-acre lot. It’s listed for $849,000 with Dave Settgast with Treasure Coast Sotheby’s International Realty.Inside, the home has been Disney-fied from top to bottom, with some rooms featuring large character murals on brightly colored walls, while others, like the kitchen, include tasteful touches such as small character paintings above the stove, or a mouse-shaped mirror in the bathroom.RELATED: Disney World Announces New ‘Nature-Inspired’ Resort to Open in 2022: Everything to Know NowThe home’s front door even pays homage to classic characters with an image of Mickey and Minnie Mouse rendered in stained glass.In the entry, even more Disney artwork jumps out on the walls, from a floor-to-ceiling mural of Cinderella at her castle (with Goofy, Donald Duck and Mickey near the moat) to another of Snow White and her woodland creatures painted directly on the wall near the stairs.Aside from all of the Disney decor, the home also features a guest house, a billiards room, a home theater and a five-car garage.The home’s outdoor space is reminiscent of a Disney waterpark.In addition to the front yard’s lagoon in the classic silhouetted Mickey symbol, there’s the backyard’s massive Mickey–shaped, resort-style pool and hot tub, complete with a stone-enclosed waterfall, a tiki-style hut, a grotto, and a walking bridge.RELATED: Disney World Is Offering Princess Makeovers to Adults Who Want to Fulfill Their Childhood DreamsSituated on a lake and zoned for horses and other grazing animals, the property also features a barn and go-cart track, there’s even a little bit of the Animal Kingdom and a thrill ride nearby!Disney does own its own it’s own community of custom-built mansions on the resort property called Golden Oaks, and another colorful community of homes in Celebration, Florida.

Title: Colbert Knows Where You Can Put Your Ashes Instead of Disney
Author: Anonymous
Body: According to a Wall Street Journal report published earlier this week, more people than you’d think have taken to sprinkling their loved one’s cremated remains in Disneyland and Walt Disney World, focusing more on their deceased relative’s love for the Happiest Place on Earth and less on the fact that park employees have to then vacuum those ashes up and put them right in the garbage.So it’s probably time to rethink your plans for sifting your great uncle’s cremains throughout the Haunted Mansion (According to WSJ, “The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny.”) but if you’re already in Florida with a full urn, the Late Show begs of you: at least take it over to Busch Gardens. They’re way more into this kind of thing. Already a subscriber? Log in or link your magazine subscription

Title: Scattering ashes at Disney parks is a thing, custodians claim
Author: Anonymous
Body: Posted: Oct 26, 2018 10:58 PM EDTUpdated: Oct 26, 2018 10:58 PM EDTANAHEIM (KRON) - Who knew that Disneyland and Walt Disney World were reportedly among the most popular places for families to scatter ashes of their loved ones? Custodians at the theme parks claim that guests have scattered ashes so many times that it's even prompted a special code word for cleanup, according to The Wall Street Journal. That code word is HEPA, which refers to an ultrafine vacuum cleaner that needs to be used. Custodians tell the publication it happens once a month and some places are more popular than others. “The Haunted Mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny,” one custodian told WSJ.Other popular areas where ashes are reportedly spread include flower beds and water rides like Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a Small World.

Title: World of Disney reopens after year-long transformation |Chain Store Age
Author: Anonymous
Body: The ultimate Disney retail experience is back.The World of Disney, the signature store at both Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif., and Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., has reopened with a totally new look. More than a year in development, the new concept is designed to make shopping easier and more fun. The makeover touched every store feature and function, from displays to signage to lighting and more, and makes the products the stars of the show. Disney storytelling and digital “pixie dust” is featured throughout the space.The transformation begins with the store’s exterior, which features new marquees and magical window displays. On the interior, an open, loft-style design provides full visibility across the space.In a twist, the merchandise serves as décor in the new World of Disney. In one area, a giant Mickey Mouse Club ear hat beckons shoppers to the new Mickey Mouse Club Collection. Several spaces throughout the store will change regularly, showcasing the newest Disney offerings of the season.Complementing the displays are “enchanted” flourishes inspired by the history of the Walt Disney Animation Studios and the “nine old men,” the legendary animators who created classic films such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Peter Pan” and “Fantasia.” In one example, ink jars suddenly swirl with color and animate artwork on the walls. Out of nowhere, blank pages fill with pencil sketches as if drawn by an invisible hand.In addition, “enchanted” movie posters twinkle with digital “pixie dust” and come to life before shoppers’ eyes. The store’s sales counters are inspired by the desks and furniture used by animators of generations past.“We saw World of Disney as an opportunity to reimagine what Disney retail is today,” said Alysia Kelley, VP of visual merchandising and location strategy for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. “The new store design highlights the best of what is current and new, while also celebrating classic Disney heritage based in storytelling.”Both locations offer shoppers the option to purchase reusable bags, rather than use plastic bags, part of The Walt Disney Company’s global commitment toward significant single-use plastic reduction by mid-2019. Featuring artwork of Disney characters, the reusable bags are offered in three sizes for a nominal fee.World of Disney is an anchor location at both Downtown Disney District, Anaheim, Calif., and Disney Springs, Lake Buena Vista, Fla.You must be logged in to post a comment.No comments found

Title: Disney pass holders wonder if annual ticket price is getting too steep - Orlando Sentinel
Author: Gabrielle Russon
Body: Rey Fernandez is such a Disney fan that he booked his hotel about 21 months in advance for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge even though no official opening date has been announced next year at Walt Disney World. He didn’t even make reservations this far in advance for his wedding.But when it comes to his annual pass, the 37-year-old bank IT worker from Naples is having doubts.“It gets pretty expensive,” said Fernandez, who is considering downgrading his pass to save money when it’s time to renew again.Walt Disney World last week raised some annual pass prices by as much as 10 percent, following earlier price increases in February. Another pass option stayed the same in price while several others jumped about 3 percent.Under the new prices, a platinum plus pass costs $849 a year while on the lower end, the pass to get into Epcot after 4 p.m. runs $289.“We use pricing to manage the extraordinary demand for our parks with the goal of providing great experiences for our guests no matter when they visit. This includes a variety of annual pass options,” said Jacquee Wahler, vice president of communications, in a statement.The price increases cost pass holders $4 or less extra a month, a Disney spokeswoman said, as the theme parks are adding more events and build new rides.Historically, it’s only the fourth time Disney has raised the cost of annual passes twice in the same year, said Rick Munarriz, a senior analyst for Motley Fool, who recently penned an article: “Is Disney World Trying to Price Out Its Annual Passholders?”“People love Disney World as an icon, as a place that stirs up nostalgia. At the end of the day, it’s a business,” said Munarriz, who lives in Miami and holds passes for all the major theme parks in Orlando. “If they can charge more, why wouldn’t they?Munarriz believes Disney’s strategy is phasing in price increases quietly as the Star Wars opening looms closer next year instead of doing it all at once with one massive bump, he said.A Disney spokeswoman declined to say if passes will go up again before Star Wars is scheduled to open in late fall 2019.If the new prices wean off some pass holders, the demand among other visitors will certainly still exist, Munarriz said, looking at Disney’s upcoming lineup that also includes the popular Tron roller coaster coming to Magic Kingdom and the first-ever Mickey Mouse-themed dark ride at Hollywood Studios. Epcot is also getting a rehaul with new rides and a fireworks show.From Disney’s point of view, the out-of-towners hold more value anyway than pass holders since they stay longer at Disney resorts, buy dining passes and pick up souvenirs, Munarriz said.“Pass holders like me, we are the seat-fillers in the Academy Awards,” he said.A Disney spokeswoman said the company is not trying to phase out pass holders, adding that it creates special perks for them, such as complimentary parking and discounts on merchandise and food.But higher prices can also help Disney filter out the crowds so visitors have a better time, said Scott Smith, an Orlando native who is now an associate professor at the University of South CarolinaWhen Star Wars opens, “It’s going to be so crowded, it’s going to make Harry Potter look like nothing,” Smith said.At least higher prices may help alleviate the masses for the first Star Wars land-goers.“Disney may seem like they are cold and callous for raising prices for Star Wars, but they’re ensuring they get pleased guests,” Smith said. “They’re making sure there is not a mob.”Dozens of Disney fans shared a range of opinions with the Sentinel on whether daily ticket and pass price changes will affect their spending.For some, Disney is their happy place and they shrugged off price increases saying it was worth it and would not affect them. Others planned to cut back whether that meant traveling to Disney less often or bringing their own food into the parks to save money.Some expressed frustration with the price jumps but acknowledged the parks are already intensely crowded today so the move made sense.Before her 60th birthday, Lori Mauer meet with her financial adviser, who encouraged her to save more for retirement.“Or I could go to Disney,” Mauer told her because life is short.“To me, there is no choice,” said Mauer, a writer who plans to move to Orlando from Coral Springs to be closer to the parks next year. “Disney is my passion.”It bothers her that her annual pass prices have crept up over the years, but Mauer, whose had her pass for the majority of the past 20 years, pays it anyway. She cuts back on other things, like skipping a work conference she wanted to attend.“I know what I have to give up in order to go to Disney,” Mauer said.Got a news tip? grusson@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5470; Twitter, @GabrielleRusson

Title: 7 Disney books to read before your next vacation
Author: Bailee Abell

Whether you’re planning a Disney trip or you just want to beat the Disney blues, here are seven books to read to get you in the Disney spirit.If you’ve never read a book about the history of the Walt Disney Company or the Disney parks and resorts, this is a great place to start. Written by Aaron H. Goldberg, this book chronicles the story of Disney decade by decade, from the release of Walt Disney’s first cartoons to the newest Disney park and everything in between. This book is a must-read for any Disney fanatic or history buff, and with its chronological organization it can be read over and over again. Check this one out if you’re itching for some Disney facts in between vacations.Don’t you love walking through Walt Disney World and searching for all the hidden gems and little-known secrets throughout the four theme parks? If so, this book is the one for you. “The Hidden Magic of Walt Disney World” includes details about all four parks at Walt Disney World and shares all the Walt Disney World facts you never knew you never knew, from some that seem under-the-radar to others that are really right under your nose. What makes this book a great read is the excitement factor it possesses. Author Susan Veness tells readers to be on the lookout for certain hidden magical elements all over Walt Disney World, so you’ll be itching to discover them on your next trip. Whether you read this a year before you plan to visit the parks again or on the plane while you’re on your way to Orlando, you’ll definitely enjoy it.Some may write this one off as a coffee table book, but it’s so much more than that.

Korkis brings to light the short stories and hidden elements of Disneyland, from fun facts to little-known secrets, so readers can easily enjoy his book while waiting in line for the Disneyland Railroad or lounging on their couch at home. If you love Korkis’s “Secret Stories” series, this one should be the next on your list.Rounding off our list is “Walt Disney World Hidden History” by Kevin Yee. This book is the perfect read for anyone who loves to find the little details that Imagineers leave behind when creating the magic at Disney parks or reimagining attractions. There are many elements of Walt Disney World history that are both intentionally and unintentionally present at the parks today, from the names appearing on the windows of Main Street U.S.A. to small elements of past attractions that are no longer running at the parks. If you love a good mystery or finding historic parts of the Disney parks that hardly anybody pays attention to, consider reading this book before your next trip. We’re sure you’ll be planning a trip back to Orlando sooner than you think. There you have it, our top books for helping cure your post-Disney blues. Whether you’re a collector of Disney books, a lover of Disney trivia, or a planner who is always itching to get back to the Happiest Place on Earth, any of these books will be worth a read.What is your favorite book to read when planning a Disney vacation?

Title: When will Disneyland next raise prices to limit attendance? – Orange County Register
Author: Robert Niles
Body: GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X Trending: Something unusual happened in the theme park business last week. The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida changed its ticket prices … and Disneyland didn’t do a thing.The Disney theme parks had developed a habit in recent years of raising their ticket and annual pass prices at the same time. But last week, Walt Disney World rolled out a wide-ranging change in the way it prices theme park tickets that Disneyland has not yet matched — and might not.Disney World now charges different prices on its multi-day tickets for different dates of visit, extending the pricing system both it and Disneyland introduced on one-day tickets two years ago. Ticket prices for most days went up, but Disney cut prices on a few days — a rare price decrease for the company.Disney said that it made the changes in part to encourage people to shift their visits from crowded periods to less-busy times of the year. So why wouldn’t Disneyland do the same?I can hear the thought passing through the minds of many Disneyland fans reading this: “What less-busy times of the year?”Exactly. Date-based pricing for single-day tickets and annual pass block-out calendars have done much to help fill what used to pass for an off season at Disneyland. So has an expanding calendar of special events, including Halloween Time, the revived Food & Wine Festival at Disney California Adventure and the Festival of the Holidays. That doesn’t leave many weeks when Disneyland’s theme parks are sitting around with empty queues to handle the overflow from the peak seasons.Weekdays during the school year used to mean walk-ons for even top rides throughout the parks. But this month I have seen wait times consistently run over an hour for rides such as Star Tours and Splash Mountain on weekday afternoons, when schools and jobs used to keep people away from the parks. Just imagine how bad it might be next fall, after the new Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge land opens next summer.If Disneyland does expand date-based pricing for its tickets, I wouldn’t expect any price cuts at the low end. Disneyland doesn’t have enough slow days left to fill to bother with that. If anything, Disneyland needs to cut its attendance to more manageable levels throughout the year.Obviously, the company wants to keep increasing its revenue instead of cutting it. Date-based pricing at Disneyland could provide one way of doing that, by pushing higher average price increases than Disney might be able to get away with charging the same prices across the board. Disney also could make more changes to its annual pass program to increase spending while limiting attendance, as it did earlier this year in announcing park-specific blockout calendars for next year.Disneyland might have sat out this most recent Disney World price change. But I don’t think many fans expect Disneyland to stand pat on its ticket and annual pass programs much longer. Not with crowds filling the parks they way they have been this month.Get the latest news delivered daily!We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

Title:  Couple Manages To Visit 6 Disney Parks On 2 Coasts In 1 Day 
Author: Anonymous
Body: A couple from Tennessee managed to visit six different Disney theme parks in two different states on opposite coasts, all in the same day.For most of us, especially if we don't live in the US, visiting Disneyland is a once in a lifetime experience. There is enough to do in just one of Disney's many theme parks to keep you entertained for an entire day, if not longer. However, for one couple in Tennessee, one Disney park in one day was simply not enough.Now granted, the parks in Orlando, Florida are all pretty close together. Knocking the four of them out in one day isn't that tall an order. Again though, that wasn't enough for Heather and Clark Ensminger. The Disney-loving couple wanted to spend their tenth wedding anniversary achieving the seemingly unachievable. This is what they did and how they did it, courtesy of USA Today.RELATED: DISNEY WORLD TO OPEN NATURE THEMED RESORT IN 2020Not only did the Ensmingers visit all four of Orlando's Disney parks, they also hit the two in Los Angeles, California that very same day. No, you did not read that wrong, we are indeed talking about a coast-to-coast, one-day, Disney extravaganza. Heather and Clark began their day in Orlando and had breakfast at Disney's Hollywood Studios last Wednesday at 7 am.Next on the agenda, Epcot, where they arrived two hours later. Another hour and a half after that, they arrived at the Magic Kingdom, paying Gaston's Tavern a quick visit. Lunch at the Animal Kingdom marked park number four and then came the hard part. A cross-country flight to Los Angeles. Thanks to the miracle of time difference, the couple arrived on the west coast at 6:45 pm Pacific time, but there was no time to waste.By 8 pm, the two of them were taking in the sights and scenes of Disney California Adventure Park. From there on in it was pretty much plain sailing and their time was their own. Disneyland was the last park on the list, and they stayed there until 11:30 pm, half an hour before closing time. That's a long day by anyone's standards, but one that Heather and Clark won't soon forget.NEXT: CHECK OUT THIS BRAILLE-FRIENDLY STATUE MADE FROM MORE THAN 20,000 NAILS AND SCREWS

Title: Let's take a trip to the Disney rumor mill
Author: Anonymous
Body: October 26, 2018, 3:38 PM · Three rumors about Disney theme parks have been attracting a lot of attention over the past couple of weeks. As some of you might have noticed, I haven't written about any of them. But that doesn't mean I have been ignoring the reports.After talking with knowledgeable people I respect in the industry, I do not believe that any of these rumors are the "done deals" that some have portrayed them to be. (And to be fair here, as far as I can tell, the initial sources of these rumors did not portray them as 100% incontestable fact, either. That came as these rumors went viral and twisted in the inevitable game of telephone.) But I have found some interesting perspective in checking these rumors, which I now feel is worth sharing. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Some background: I never want to waste your time here on Theme Park Insider. Yes, it would be easier to play along with the crowd, join the echo chamber and throw up a bunch of clickbait. I'd probably have a lot more money in the bank if I did. But I'm a stubborn old idealist who can't bring himself to do that. So let's dive into some fact-based rumor analysis, instead.1. "Spaceship Earth is closing for 2+ years"There is no doubt inside the industry that Disney wants to do a substantial refurbishment on Spaceship Earth. The only questions are when it will start and how long it will last. Disney has ordered the installation of LED panels on the south face of Spaceship Earth, which will become part of the new World Showcase lagoon show, once IllumiNations closes after next summer. But beyond that, Disney has not ordered any additional work on Spaceship Earth... yet.Sources within Walt Disney Imagineering are known for leaking proposals to test fan reaction. But asking people's opinions on a proposal doesn't elicit the same type of passionate response as telling them a proposal is settled and going to happen. (For what it's worth, I refuse to go along knowingly with misleading Theme Park Insider readers. So that makes this a poor forum for testing proposals in the way that these Disney sources want to test them. Others are happy to play along, though.)Disney wants to know what fan reaction would be to an extended downtime for Epcot's signature attraction. It also wants to know the blowback if Spaceship Earth were closed for Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021 or Epcot's 40th in 2022. If I were running Disney, I would want to know these things, too!Spaceship Earth needs a re-do. The "personalization" animation no longer impresses anyone. As the story takes us from ancient times to the modern day, it needs updating at the conclusion every decade or so. The ride system could run more reliably and with less costly maintenance, if it were improved, too. All other things off the table, I would urge Disney to just close the thing after Christmas and start work, if asked. But Disney is deeply concerned about attendance next summer, should fans choose to delay their visits awaiting the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge next fall. Disney is pushing to get Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway open for next summer to help draw crowds. It doesn't want to undercut effort that by taking another major attraction off the table during that time. But pushing the start of Spaceship Earth's refurb beyond next fall puts a reopening by October 1, 2021 in jeopardy. So Disney wants to gauge the fan reaction to that. Should it reduce the scope and length of the refurb? Or would fans prefer that Disney get an earlier start, instead? Or are fans okay with missing the WDW 50th, so long as the refurb is done by Epcot's 40th? That's what Disney management is considering now. But I have found no indication that the decision has been made to the point of no return.2. "The plans for DCA's Marvel Land have leaked"Unlike the previous rumor, I think there's a possibility that this one is just someone's imagination at work. Why? Because Disney's options in getting this Super Hero-themed land open by its announced debut date are so limited that a knowledgeable observer could predict a lot of what is going to happen in this land. In other words, you could take a guess here and have a pretty good chance at being right.With a 2020 opening announced, Disney simply does not have the time to build a new dark-ride show building for this land — not in California, with its stringent building regulations. So any new attractions here will have to be carnival-type rides that Disney can install outside, or an indoor attraction that it can install inside the former "It's Tough to Be a Bug" building. That means either a show or a screen-based ride. There's simply not enough room in there for anything else.Disney also is building a Marvel-themed land at Hong Kong Disneyland, with plans to expand Marvel's presence at Walt Disney Studios in Paris. So keep those proposals in mind while thinking about the California Adventure land. The Marvel Super Heroes United live show didn't exactly wow audiences at WDS last summer, so I doubt that Disney would lean on it as the centerpiece of its California land. That leaves a screen-based ride or show here. The two options are to install Hong Kong's Iron Man ride, which is another Star Tours-like motion simulator, or to put in a Midway Mania-like shooter, which could be a scaled version Hong Kong's Ant-Man ride (which is actually a Buzz Lightyear makeover). Both duplicate ride systems that Disney has already at the resort: one across the esplanade and one inside the same park. But the shooter ride would be easier (and cheaper) to install, so let's go with it. And Disney's key art for the new land features Spider-Man, so let's also assume that the ride will be themed to what is arguably Marvel's most popular character, instead of Ant-Man or Iron Man.To fill out the land, there's the Stark Expo show from Disney in Paris, or the Doctor Strange bit from Disney World that got plussed for the Disney Cruise Line. Take your pick, or go for both. Long term, Disney has an available parking lot south of Mission Breakout that it is eying for phase two of the Marvel land. Slot 2023's Marvel track ride/coaster from Hong Kong Disneyland into that space.But are a screen-based shooter and an outdoor show or two enough to anchor a new Disney theme park land, especially one themed to what is arguably the most popular current film franchise in the world? This is where the scenario of another WDI/Disney management trial balloon enters the picture. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will have opened at Disneyland the summer before. Surely that land will be popular enough to sustain increased attraction for a second summer, right? Does Disney really need a Marvel land at California Adventure to balance the crowds, or can it wait a season or two (or three) to open it as a completed land, instead of as the first of two parts?The only potential competitive pressure for Disney in Southern California is Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which certainly will not be ready by 2020, as construction hasn't gone vertical for it yet. Is Disney testing fan reaction to see if it can wait beyond 2020 for its DCA Marvel land, or to see if it needs to spice up the offering with additional or plussed attractions?Your guess is as good as mine.3. "Disney's Animal Kingdom is getting an Indiana Jones land"It's Halloween season, so how appropriate that we would have a theme park rumor rise from the grave, like a zombie.If you have read my 10-step process to help you better judge theme park rumors, mark this one as step-one spitballing. I am sure that at some point, Disney has spec'd out the potential for converting DAK's Dino land into an Indiana Jones theme. The Dinosaur ride uses the same ride system and track layout for Disneyland's Indiana Jones ride. The Boneyard excavation pit is an easy switch to an Indiana Jones theme — just bury fake artifacts instead of dino fossils. Replace the two flat rides few people will miss with just about anything (maybe the Indy coaster from TDS and DLP?), redecorate the rest of the land, and you're good to go. The proposal's relative ease make it alluring — to both Disney and rumormongers. But Walt Disney World's construction dance card is filled through 2022, at the earliest, with Star Wars, the Magic Kingdom's Tron coaster, and the new Epcot rides. Now that would put Disney's Animal Kingdom at the top of the rotation among the four parks for something new. While an Indiana Jones makeover would provide a relatively cheap option, it would need to fit into Disney's broader strategy with the Indiana Jones franchise. If another Disney franchise blows up between now and 2022, Disney might well decide to go in that direction instead of returning to a character it's had in its parks for decades. So enjoy kicking around this idea for the next few years, if you'd like. But at this point, it remains speculation. It's not yet news.Update: A source reached out to say that the latest twist on the Indy rumor is that it would replace the stunt show at DHS, and not Dinoland USA. To me, that sounds even more implausible that the DAK rumor, given that Hollywood Studios already will have gotten Toy Story Land, Star Wars, and Runaway Railway, in short order.If this is another trial balloon, it suggest to me that the question is whether the Indiana Jones theme or the stunt show format is more important to fans. If the reaction to the rumor seems to favor the replacement land, Disney can infer that the Indy theme matters more to fans. But if people seem to prefer the stunt show over something else Indy-themed in that space, Disney might infer that it's the stunt show itself that people care about more... and take that as a green light to consider switching the show to another theme. Again, it's speculation.The 10-step process to help judge theme park rumorsLike posts such as this one? Support Theme Park Insider with a one-time or monthly donation. Thank you!Personally, I'm fine on waiting for Marvel Land until it is completely done and not released in separate phases.We've seen with Pixar Pier that opening a land/area with some of it unfinished can cause headaches and simply look unappealing. For such an IP like Marvel, I'd prefer them take their time and have a grandiose release instead of rushing it to ease SWL crowds. An Indy Land should be at DHS. More still needs to be done there. DAK is good, MK is good, EPCOT is next. Spaceship Earth should never have lost the spacecraft and astronauts at the peak Of the ride. It was an amazing. I saw all these stories as well, and was amazed at how many other outlets picked up on them, all sourced to the original rumor post without any further digging for information. I always tell people that until Disney officially announces it, take it with a large grain of salt. And even when Disney DOES announce it, keep a grain of salt on hand just in case it falls through (like Disneyland's fourth hotel). I find it really interesting that Disney will either have to tone down phase 1 Marvel land in California or move back the opening date significantly. First off the promo picture did prominently display Spider-Man. I think it would be a big mistake to have a more simplified Phase 1 ride featuring Spider-Man as their main draw of the land at opening. I know it’s on separate coasts but Universal Orlando also has a Spider-Man ride that even though it’s approaching 20 years old is one of the better dark rides out there. Now I’m not saying it’s the best ever, but it still ranks high on peoples favorite ride lists. It was said ever since Disney acquired Marvel that if they build a Mavel land it would be directly compared to Universal’s. Now if they create a ride based on the brands most popular hero that already has a really great ride I feel you need to make it at least equal but really should be trying to step it up another notch. If they don’t bring it with a really great Spider-Man ride, that’s a big fail in my book. The Spaceship Earth rumor is believable, and given that it's in Epcot I think it makes more sense to premiere a new version for Epcot's 40th rather than WDW's 50th (especially since that will have so many other things attached to it). I doubt it would be quite as extensive as portrayed, but the ride really is Epcot's signature dark ride and a much-needed overhaul would be a great upgrade.I have heard from a few places that DCA's Marvel Land will be built up in 2-3 phases, with the first phase opening in 2020 (probably in case MCU popularity declines post-Avengers 4) and the second phase a year or two later. More likely than not, the first phase will be about creating an interactive superhero universe similar to Star Wars Land, then the second will include the actual rides. Whether it will wind up working or not is anyone's guess...I've got a feeling it might extend trips, but won't get new trips until phase two is ready.The Indy rumor, on the other hand, seems highly unbelievable to me, especially if built in Animal Kingdom. I could maybe see it at DHS, but not for 5+ years, and only if the new Indy movie does extremely well. As good as Indiana Jones is, the window for that franchise has somewhat passed, and it would probably be better for Disney to invest in an IP that is more appealing to the current generation. I so hope Indiana Jones ends up in Anaimal Kingdom and NOT Hollywood Studios Jumping on AJ’s comment. I don’t believe the Indiana Jones window has passed. A legacy IP always has a place in the Disney parks. A Snow White roller coaster is being introduced in parks and tha’ts the “original” IP. A new Peter Pan attraction is in planning for Disney Seas. Indy will always work. As a long time Disney Supporter of oh say 70 years, I am appalled at some of these changes through the years, example :High park prices and Cruise Rates (I am a Florida Resident) Reboots.......This last insult of dropping Johnny Depp from Pirates is not only a insult to His fan base,but will cost a drop in the fan base for Disney.BTW I am a woman. I was along with family and many friends visited the parks, took their cruises for over the past 25 years. WE ARE DONE. This article has been archived and is no longer accepting comments.
