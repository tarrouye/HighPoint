Most of the commentary around the Model 3 is focused on the stakes for Tesla, and many are parsing over every tweet by CEO Elon Musk for clues about the car’s cost, interior, and what sort of options will be available. But how has Tesla changed they way we shop for and drive cars? What realities about the nature of the business has it forced its competitors to face? Let’s examine this more closely:

Autopilot

When Tesla first released Autopilot in October 2015, Musk cautioned drivers to “be quite careful.” After all, this was the first time that semi-autonomous technology of this level was being offered in a commercial vehicle. Musk acknowledged that ""some people"" may take their hands off the wheel regardless, adding, ""We do not advise that.”

He was right, of course. It only took a couple of days for YouTube to fill up with videos of Tesla drivers treating their cars like they were fully autonomous, sometimes with frightening results. The videos were proof that some people will always react idiotically when handed a new and powerful technology. And more than that, it sent a clear signal to the rest of the auto industry about the direction it was headed.

Of course, it wasn’t a fully autonomous vehicle in the vein of a Google car — the primary feature of Autopilot was what Tesla called Autosteer, which keeps the car in its current lane once you're already on the road and manages speed and distance from the car ahead of it.

Autonomy wasn’t just science experiment being fussed over by a few Silicon Valley eggheads

Autonomy isn’t just a science experiment being fussed over by a few Silicon Valley eggheads. It is the end goal for all cars, and Musk was giving regular people their first taste. Since Autopilot’s first appearance, all the major automakers have announced their own plans to roll out semi-autonomous or highly automated systems. GM is equipping the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is getting Drive Pilot. Nissan has ProPilot. Audi says the new A8 will be Level 3 autonomous. And on and on.

With the release of the Model 3, the big question now is where Autopilot is heading. Last year, Tesla split with auto vision startup Mobileye and embarked on its own path toward automation. Since then, Musk has announced that all Tesla models will be equipped with technology to make them fully driverless. If there’s no update on the future of Autopilot at tonight’s event, it seems safe to assume that the departure of Mobileye was more damaging to Tesla’s project than the company is letting on.

Hands-free will soon be standard in most vehicles, with experts pointing to 2020 as the year we’ll start to see autonomous and semi-autonomous cars on the road en masse. But Tesla got there first.

Electrification

Much like Autopilot forced the big automakers to begin developing their own semi-autonomous systems, Musk’s commitment to bringing electrification to the masses proved to be equally influential. The success of the Model S and X, as well as Tesla’s stock valuation of $56 billion, served as a strong signal about the direction of the industry.

Musk was too successful in pushing his rivals to embrace electrification

One could argue Musk was too successful in pushing his rivals to embrace electrification. GM beat Tesla to the punch by releasing its mass-market EV, the Chevy Bolt, months before the Model 3. But Musk may still have a few tricks up his sleeve. Many will be watching to see whether the Model 3’s base model will have more or less range than the Bolt. Last year, Tesla said the car would run more than 215 miles per charge — but how much more? The Bolt gets 239 miles of range. That’s a lot for a base model, but Musk is hyper-competitive and not likely to let that slide.

By 2040, analysts now say that 54 percent of all cars sold on the planet will be electric. France’s environmental minister said yesterday his country would ban the sale of all fossil fuel-burning vehicles by 2040. The UK was quick to follow. And Volvo said it would stop selling gas-only cars by 2019. Welcome to the Tesla party.

Design

If you look at all the electric vehicles on the market today, they all sort of look the same... which is to say, not great. Most are squat, ugly hatchbacks with some odd design feature or accent. None have the smooth, sinuous look of the Model S, or the capacity for surprise like the Model X. The forthcoming Model 3 has been criticized as being the ugliest of Tesla’s three vehicles. But that hasn’t stopped nearly a half million people from forking over $1,000 in deposit to reserve one.

Electric cars are still very much in their infancy. Though they enjoy blanket media coverage (ahem, guilty), the EV market still has yet to take off. Sales of electric cars represent just 1 percent of the record 17.55 million cars sold last year in the US. And a recent survey of 2,500 American found that 60 percent were still “unaware of electric cars,” eclipsing concerns such as range or charging station availability.

Tesla made electric cars cool and desirable

But would as many of us be talking about electrification with the excitement and energy we are today had Ford or Nissan gotten to market first? Tesla made electric cars cool and desirable. By transforming its vehicles into rolling tablets, Tesla invited comparisons to that other manufacturer making consumer products so popular that people line up days before their release. (You know the one I’m talking about.)

Look inside a Tesla, and the comparison to Apple really comes into focus. Granted, other automakers haven’t made as bold a move as to replace the center instrument cluster with a 17-inch touchscreen tablet. But those other legacy automakers are burdened with decades of history. As noted by my colleague Lauren Goode in her review of the Model S, “Tesla came into existence at a time when this kind of in-car technology was foundational, not evolving.”

Software

This is where things get ominous. Tesla’s ability to update the software of its vehicles with over-the-air updates is probably the one thing that makes the rest of the industry highly vulnerable to obsolescence. Case in point (and apologies if this makes anyone feel old): the Model S launched five years ago, and there are still very few cars on sale today capable of delivering OTA firmware updates.

“They continue to sell vehicles that are incapable of learning and improving and are highly vulnerable to obsolescence,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a recent note to clients, according to Electrek. “Car companies have had ample opportunity to tear apart Model S’s in the lab. We suspect Tesla’s vertically integrated in-house software capabilities and its willingness to assume the risk of hacking make the difference.”

Of course, the legacy automakers are beholden to their franchise dealerships as both middlemen and service providers, which OTA updates would obviate. Tesla isn’t encumbered by these relationships, preferring instead to rely on direct sales to its fan base. This way it can fix bugs by pushing updates instead of relying on dealerships to service the vehicle. And software updates are easier to handle when you’re a boutique brand, while most big companies would confront challenges when scaling up.

The future

Tesla has also helped define the outsized role Silicon Valley has come to play in the auto industry. Before Tesla, you could count the number of startups working on automotive technology on one hand. Now, every few months, a new “Tesla killer” emerges to make a grab at Musk’s crown.

Faraday Future, Lucid Motors, NextEV, and others are all trying to replicate Musk’s strategy by building luxurious (or in the case of FF, ultra-luxurious) electric vehicles, build a fan base, and then use the profits and capital to build a mass-market empire. Musk himself has only just reached that crucial stage now. Whether it will be successful will depend on a variety of factors, including his company’s ability to ramp up high-volume production to a level never before seen.

every few months, a new ‘Tesla killer’ emerges to make a grab at Musk’s crown

“Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today,” Musk wrote back in 2013, “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.”

Musk notes that it took considerable time and trial-and-error to get Tesla where it is today. “If we could have done that with our first product, we would have, but that was simply impossible to achieve for a startup company that had never built a car and that had one technology iteration and no economies of scale,” he said.

Musk disproved most assumptions about the near-impossibility of creating a brand new car company out of whole cloth. And then he went on to bend the entire industry to his vision of the future. Whether he can maintain his mission will depend entirely on the next few months and the rollout of Tesla’s next vehicle. Hyperloops and high-speed tunnels are just a distraction. Keep a close eye on the Model 3. It will tell us everything we need to know."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/business/tesla-model-3-elon-musk.html,pos,0.9999998642264342,1.35773570236908e-07,"In Pivotal Moment, Tesla Unveils Its First Mass-Market Sedan",2017-07-29 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:17:45.799889,Bill Vlasic,"FREMONT, Calif. — After a meteoric rise that made it, at least briefly, the most valuable car company in America, Tesla arrived at a moment of truth on Friday night as it delivered the first of its mass-market sedans to their new owners.

For a decade, the company has been a manufacturer of high-end electric cars in small numbers. But now, Tesla is aiming at much loftier goals. It wants not only to become a large-scale producer in the suddenly crowded field of battery-powered vehicles but also to lure consumers away from mainstream, gasoline-powered automobiles.

Yet Tesla’s expansion comes with a set of risks. It plans to more than quadruple its annual production to more than a half-million vehicles, while still maintaining its image as an enlightened outlier in an industry long dominated by global giants — who are racing to develop electrified vehicles of their own.

Tesla unveiled its new Model 3 sedans, starting at $35,000, in a ceremony on Friday night on the grounds of its sprawling assembly plant and research facility outside San Francisco. To the cheers of hundreds of employees and invited guests, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, drove onstage in a Model 3 and heralded a new chapter in the company’s growth."
https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/as-tesla-model-3-launches-11-year-old-blog-post-re.html,pos,0.9999999999959023,4.139782174404897e-12,This Elon Musk Blog Post From 2006 Shows Exactly Why He's So Successful,2017-07-28 20:37:06,2019-06-24 14:17:46.148812,Co-Author + The Geek Gap + Like This Column + Sign Up To + The Opinions Expressed Here Inc.Com Columnists Are Their Own + Not Those Of Inc.Com.,"Tonight is an important night for Elon Musk, Tesla, and the entire automotive industry. At a party that starts at 8:45 p.m. Pacific time, the company will hand over Tesla Model 3 keys to 30 of the more than 100,000 people who pre-ordered it, at $35,000 the company's first affordable electric car.

You may think this event was a long time coming but you probably don't realize just how long. Neither did I until our friends at Business Insider pointed it out. Musk first announced his plan to build an affordable electric vehicle in a 2006 blog post. Back then, he wasn't even CEO of Tesla. He called his post ""The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me).""

""My day job is running a space transportation company called SpaceX, but on the side I am the chairman of Tesla Motors and help formulate the business and product strategy with Martin [Tesla founder Martin Eberhard] and the rest of the team,"" he wrote back then.

Then he went on to describe his master plan:

As you know, the initial product of Tesla Motors is a high performance electric sports car called the Tesla Roadster. However, some readers may not be aware of the fact that our long term plan is to build a wide range of models, including affordably priced family cars. This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.

With that in mind, he posed two obvious questions: ""Are we really in need of another high performance sports car? Will it actually make a difference to global carbon emissions?""

The answers to those questions, he acknowledged, were no, and not much. But, he said, that missed the point. Any brand-new technology has a high single-unit cost at first. But that was just part of the master plan. Tesla's next car would would be a ""sporty four door family car at roughly half the $89k price point on the Tesla Roadster, and the third model will be even more affordable.""

Not quite, but close.

OK, so he didn't get the prices quite right. The Roadster was followed by the $57,400 Model S and the $80,000 Model X. Still, more than 10 years ago, he knew exactly where he was ultimately headed, and he got there.

His ability to carry out a master plan reminds me of the Jeff Bezos adage ""We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details."" Bezos is another long-term thinker who started out with an online bookstore but knew from the beginning that he wanted to sell just about everything.

It also mattered that Musk was ready to risk everything to make his vision come true. In late 2008, Musk poured his entire personal fortune into Tesla and SpaceX. His only worry at the time was whether it would be a better strategy to pour his entire fortune into only one of them, to give it the best chance of survival. Preserving some or all of his fortune by avoiding this personal risk does not seem to have even figured in his thinking as a remote possibility--even as the Great Recession came close to taking both companies down.

How about you?

So ask yourself: What do you care about so much that you would keep working toward a single vision for more than 10 years? And what do you care about so much that you would risk your own financial safety to keep it alive?

If you have an answer to that question (whether it's a startup, a job, a creative endeavor, or something else), that's where you should focus your passion.

Musk's new goals include boring tunnels under major cities through which cars can be whisked along, avoiding traffic, and building the first colony on Mars. Both ideas sound a little crazy, and yet with his tenacity and ability to plan far ahead, I wouldn't bet against him."
https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/28/technology/tesla-model-3-matters/index.html,pos,0.9999955686036365,4.4313963894534455e-06,Why the Tesla Model 3 is a really big deal,2017-07-28 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:17:48.091017,Peter Valdes-Dapena,"For a lot of people, Tesla is electric cars. Plenty of other automakers make electric cars, but no other automaker has brought more attention to electric cars than Tesla.

When the Model 3 was unveiled to great fanfare in April, 2016, 350,000 people raced to put down $1,000 deposits for one in the first week. The first customer deliveries of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3 will doubtless gain far more attention than the first deliveries of Chevrolet Bolt EVs got seven months ago.

""This is a seminal moment for EVs,"" said Jeremy Acevedo, an analyst with the automotive Web site Edmunds.com.

If even half of the people who put down a deposit on the Model 3 actually buy one, then this car alone will give a huge boost to EV sales, he pointed out. There were 78,000 electric cars sold in the U.S. last year, over half of which were Tesla Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. The Model 3, just by itself, could easily double or even triple electric vehicle sales in the U.S. if Tesla can ramp up production.

Getting more electric cars on the road should help with the broader acceptance of the technology, he said. That should be good, not just for Tesla, but General Motors, Nissan and other automakers who sell electric cars.

But there's no guarantee. Consider the Toyota Prius hybrid car. In the early 2000s, when the Prius went on sale in the United States, hybrid technology was not well understood or accepted by consumers. But ultimately, the Prius was a huge hit for Toyota (TM), quickly becoming one of the best-selling cars in its line-up.

But that success never translated into long-term success for other hybrids, says Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports. In the end, the Prius was more of a one-hit hybrid wonder than the beginning of a trend.

Rebecca Lindland, an industry analyst with Kelley Blue Book, argues that the glass is half full and not half empty.

She says that a lot of hybrids posted moderate sales thanks to the Prius. Those other models might have failed completely, or might never even come to market, if the Prius -- which is a Latin word meaning ""to go before"" -- had not led the way.

The same will happen with the Model 3, according Lindland who put down a $1,000 deposit for one of the cars herself.

""The Model 3 will help with the neighborhood effect for electric vehicles,"" she said.

The more Model 3s there are in driveways, the more inclined other folks in the neighborhood will be to buy an EV themselves.

Some of shoppers people might decide a Tesla isn't for them because they don't want to trust a start-up automaker. Instead, they'd prefer to buy from General Motors (GM) or Nissan (NSANF). But they've gotten the idea that they might own an EV.

Not only does the Model 3 have to contend with competition from established automakers that already have solid sales and repair operations in place. It will also have to contend with incredibly high customer expectations -- perhaps unrealistically high. That's because many Model 3 buyers undoubtedly expect to get the kind of luxury and performance of the more expensive Model S. Tesla has been clear that this won't be the case, but the luxury brand that the company has already established could pose a problem.

Additionally, Tesla has not earned a stellar reputation for reliability. Buyers of a mass-market sedan will probably be a lot less forgiving when it comes to glitches and breakdowns than early adopter luxury car buyers.

If the Model 3 fails, it will be a huge blow to the electric car market, said Acevedo.

""For Tesla and the EV market, this lightning in a bottle,"" he said. ""You can't let this fizzle. This is showtime."""

Here’s What You Need to Know,2017-07-29 04:04:23.572000,2019-06-24 14:17:49.524590,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"The Tesla Model 3 might be the newest and ""affordable"" vehicle in the electric automaker's lineup, but as I pushed my foot down on its accelerator, I thought, Yeah, this thing's still a Tesla. There's the silent driving, the signature rapid acceleration, and the semi-autonomous Autopilot function built right in. The company has been reminding customers that the Model S, its luxury car rolled out in 2012, will remain the flagship sedan and have the fanciest features. But if you’ve lusted after that expensive Model S, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Model 3 too.

This car feels like an automotive tipping point, a sign that electric vehicles—and hopefully, the infrastructure that supports them—have finally come into their own. Time will tell whether Musk & Co. can hit their deadlines and keep production lines humming—Elon Musk revealed Friday at the Model 3's coming out party that over half a million people have now plonked down $1,000 to reserve their own—but for now, it looks quite nice.

Initially, Tesla is building just two configurations of the car, to keep things simple on the production line. The base will be the $35,000 version, with a range of 220 miles and acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. The “long range” version will go a claimed 310 miles between charges, and do the 0 to 60 sprint in 5.1 seconds—but it’ll set you back $44,000. (In a break from tradition, Tesla won’t talk kilowatt-hour battery sizes, saying that customers understand range in miles better.) Both models come with just one electric motor driving the back wheels. The twin motor—the all-wheel-drive option—will follow in a few months.

Then there are optional add-ons, which will quickly jack up the price. Turning on Autopilot is $5,000. A premium package, with the fancy glass roof, power adjustable front seats, and wood trim, is another $5,000. If and when Tesla actually enables full self-driving, it will set you back another $3,000.

First thing you'll notice: The Model 3 looks like a smaller Model S. It has a conventional trunk, not a hatch, but Tesla says there will be plenty of room for a bike in the back when the seats are folded.

The door handles don’t pop out automatically, but they do fold flush into the metal, giving the car a smooth, streamlined look. It's designed to unlock as you walk up to it, using a low-power bluetooth connection to your phone to recognize you. There’s also a card, like a hotel room key, to hand to the valet—no conventional key.

The interior is the most radically different from other cars. It’s definitely minimal, but in a stylish, Scandinavian kind of way. “Everything that we do at Tesla has to be beautiful,” says Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer. “We worked to take away things that aren’t necessary, to make a clean, minimalistic interior.”

It's why the inside is dominated by the giant touchscreen; in fact, there’s nothing else. No buttons or switches, no gauges in front of the driver, not even a speed readout. It's all on the screen, which is also the main control panel. Want to turn down the heat? Tap the screen. Change the radio station? Look at a map? Switch on the headlights? Same deal. Two click-y scroll wheels on either side of the steering wheel help out too. You can use them to change the volume on your radio, but also to adjust the mirrors, for example.

Even the air vents are impeccably designed. One long slot spans the entire dash to buffet front passengers with air. You control the heat and direction with the screen too. This may not sound like “keeping things simple,” especially compared to low-tech mechanical vents, but Tesla says this actually eliminates a bunch of moving parts. If you're wondering why car nerds are so obsessive with Tesla, well, this obsessive attention to detail helps.

Push your foot down on the accelerator pedal and the Model 3 leaps away from a standing start. The acceleration of electric cars always elicits giggles—it’s some sort of unavoidable human response—and the Model 3 is no exception. It’s not as fast as Tesla’s “ludicrous” Model S, but high-performance versions will likely follow in the future. The car feels solidly built, rattle-free, and there’s no noticeable whine from the motor. All you hear is wind and tire noise.

A lever on the right hand side of the steering wheel controls movement. It’s marked Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, and Autopilot, highlighting how integral self-driving is to Tesla. To pull off autonomous driving, the Model 3 comes with the same sensors (eight cameras, radar, ultrasonics, and a supercomputer) as its larger brethren. Right now, the function enables the car to stay in its lane and keep a safe distance from the car in-front, but Musk promises full self-driving is just a software update away, though with no firm timetable for pushing that to owners.

The Model 3 isn’t the first electric car on the market, of course. The Chevrolet Bolt and BMW i3 look like competitors, but there’s a reason hundreds of thousands of people shouted “Take my money!” at Tesla and not at any other automaker. Tyler the Creator bought one. A Model S makes a cameo in Fifty Shades of Grey. Elon Musk is a media genius, and his magic makes Teslas objects of desire. Drivers want these cars—and given the reasonable price point, might be able to rationalize the cost. “If you’re trying to make a difference in the world, you have to make cars that people can afford,"" says Musk.

On Friday night, as the Model 3 launch fanfare continued, the factory wasn’t producing much more than noise, as employees gathered to watch their CEO hand over the key(cards!) to 30 staff members. They'll be driving guinea pigs, helping shake out the car's bugs. But once the party ends, Tesla will be back to work building these cars. ""We’re going to go through six months of manufacturing hell, says Musk, to manage expectations. He still believes the company will pump out 500,000 vehicles next year. So, enjoy the party, folks, because come Monday, it’s back to work."
https://mashable.com/2017/07/29/tesla-model-3-everything-you-need-to-know/,pos,1.0,6.2167506401525425e-19,Everything you need to know about the Tesla Model 3,2017-07-29 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:17:50.764462,Lance Ulanoff,"All those niggling details about Telsa's eagerly anticipated $35,000 Model 3 all-electric sedan have finally been laid bare. The first 30 owners got their cars Friday night at an event at Tesla's Fremont, California factory, and now we know so much more about the car that's had analysts and enthusiasts giddy for months.

There will be two Model 3 sedans. The $35,000 base model has a 220-mile range, can do 0-to-60 mph in 5.6 seconds, and has a top speed of 130 mph. The pricier $44,000 model has a 310-mile range, can do 0-to-60 mph in 5.1 seconds, and offers a top speed of 140 mph. That puts it in range of Tesla's more powerful and expensive ($72,000 base) Model S.

For the first few months, the $44,000 Model 3s will be the only ones to roll of the assembly line, which means we'll have to wait some more before we see the crucial, industry-breaking $35,000 model, Musk revealed.

However, even as Tesla and the Model 3 hit the first major delivery milestone — 30 cars Friday, followed by hundreds more later this year — Musk said the hard part is still ahead of them.

Finally, we get a look inside the Tesla Model 3. It's pretty spare in here. Image: Tesla

""The major challenge you face with the Model 3 is not with the product itself — it's an amazing car. We're going to go through about six months of manufacturing hell,"" said Elon Musk just hours before he delivered the first Model 3 cars to lucky pre-order customers (who are also Tesla employees and essentially beta testers). He also revealed for the first time that Tesla has roughly a half million Model 3 pre-orders and anyone who orders today won't receive their car until the end of next year.

Musk talked at length about manufacturing's ""S curve,"" (where manufacturing starts very slow and then accelerates rapidly until it levels off to an acceptable rate), and the difficulties Tesla faces in ramping up from a mere 100 cars by the end of August to the ultimate goal of a 500,000 unit yearly run rate. That would be quite an accomplishment considering Telsa has, in nine years, put roughly 200,000 electric cars on the road.

As, potentially, thousands of Model 3 all-electric sedans hit the road, those driving will be looking for more charging options. Musk said there are 6,000 supercharging stations, which recharge Teslas in a fraction of the time it takes at a public charge station, around the world. That number should grow to 10,000 by the end of this year and, 15,000 by 2019. ""We want drivers to have the freedom to go wherever they want to go whenever they want to go,"" he said.

However, unlike Model S drivers. Model 3 drivers will pay each time they use a Supercharge station. Slower public charging stations will still be free.

Simpler by design

The company has done as much as it can to simplify the manufacturing process, using everything it learned from the early trials of the Roadster build, Tesla's first electric vehicle, to the rollout of the still hellish to produce Model S. To make 20,000 Model S vehicles annually took years of planning with the team working essentially around the clock.

Tesla engineers have thought through the Model 3 and the production process ahead of time. Virtually all of thr production will happen here, at the Fremont factory, which, when it's fully expanded will, according to Musk, have the second largest footprint in the world (ostensibly behind the Pentagon). (Tesla's Gigafactory, when completed, will be the largest, Musk said.)

The Tesla Model 3 looks like a well-appointed 4-door sedan. Image: tesla

That planning and feature and design discipline has paid off. In the time it takes Tesla to build 50,000 Models S cars, they can, Musk claimed, build 250,000 Model 3 sedans.

""Everything was designed to move this car through a production line as quickly as possible with as high a production quality as possible,"" said Tesla VP of Engineering Doug Field.

That simplification process also offers more insight into core differences between Tesla's $72,000 Model S and this model.

Musk explained that the Model 3 has ""far fewer bells and whistles than on the Model S or X.""

For example, instead of automatically extending door handles that slide out when you wave your hand over them, the Model 3 has flush handles that mechanically pivot out.

The Model 3 also includes some steel in the chassis. The Model S is, by comparison, all aluminum.

The spare and simplified interiors also helps reduce build complexity, as does the use of just a single, 15-inch dashboard screen, which sits in the middle of the dashboard. There is no second screen behind the steering wheel. Musk noted how that change cuts the number of computers needed in half.

'Everything was designed to move this car through a production line as quickly as possible.'

Even the crucial battery packs are different and simpler on the Model 3. Musk said the car is using a smaller number of battery cells (three modules as opposed to the 16 found in the Model S), which results in fewer wire bundles to manage. Additionally, the Model 3 batteries are built locally (in Tesla's Nevada-based Gigafactory). The Model S batteries still come from Japan.

Ready for autonomy and more

While Tesla won't define the Model 3's autonomous capabilities by level (Level 1 through 5 are often used to define how autonomous a vehicle is, with 5 being fully autonomous), Tesla confirmed that the Model 3 is, like the Model S before it, capable of autopilot driving, with caveats. That features comes through an additional $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package, which adds the ability to auto-match traffic speed, stay within the lane, lane changes, self-parking, and upgrade software. Full autonomy will cost you an additional $3,000. Even so, it will likely be regulation that holds Tesla Model 3 customers back from fully utilizing the self-driving capabilities.

The Model 3 is, probably, more so than the Model S or Model X, designed with autonomy in mind.

""We worked to take away things that are not necessary and just make a beautiful, clean minimalistic interior that focuses on driving or being driven based on autonomy,"" said Tesla Senior Design Executive Head of Design Franz von Holzhausen.

Tesla's goal with the Model 3 was simple and elegant interiors, noted von Holzhausen. It was not about ""deleting stuff"" from the more luxurious Model S.

Musk said he didn't think consumers could find a better looking car at this price point.

""What really matters is when you get in the car, how do you feel when you drive it? What does it inspire within you,"" said Musk.

The Model 3 is a smaller car, but designed, Field said, to feel big.

""It's got a rear piece of glass that covers the whole rear of the car that gives the impression of spaciousness,"" he added, because there's basically nothing behind the passenger's head except glass. And in the front, Telsa pushed forward the dash. Everything works together to make the inside of the sedan feel larger, despite the smaller exterior.

The company also revealed other Model 3 option details. There'll be six colors, though, special paints, like Midnight Silver Metallic and Red Multi-coat, will add an additional $1,000 to the sticker price.

It will also come ready to charge with 240- and 120-volt adapters and a 20-foot charging cable.

Musk, who seemed somewhat fixated on the difficulties of reaching their production goals, noted how the company has actually worked to dampen enthusiasm. ""We do everything we can to unsell the car. Have you ever seen an ad for the Model 3?"" Even so, he noted with obvious pride that the Model 3 is the realization of a crucial goal.

""It was always the goal,"" he said, ""to build a great, affordable electric car that was better than any gasoline car. We finally have a great, affordable electric car. That's absolutely what’s needed. There are great gasoline cars. There are great, expensive electric cars, but there are not great, affordable electric cars. That’s what today means."""

Before Franz von Holzhausen signed on with what was then called Tesla Motors in 2008, he was on his way to being a member of the automotive design world's elite.

He had graduated from Art Center College of Design in the early 1990s, making him an alumnus of the world's most prestigious transportation design program, counting among its graduates the likes of J. Mays, Chris Bangle, and Henrik Fisker.

At General Motors, he designed a pair of exquisite roadsters, the Pontiac Solstice the Saturn Sky. From there he went to Mazda North America, where he ran the entire show and garnered praise for his concept vehicles.

If von Holzhausen had remained on that track, he would have been a car-design aristocrat. Instead, he took a huge leap of faith and joined a buzzy Silicon Valley startup, far from the automotive capitals in Michigan, Japan, and Germany. And he became the most influential designer of his generation.

Yes, I know that's a big statement. Jaguar's Ian Callum or Aston Martin's Marek Reichman might object, and Luc Donckerwolke is capturing plenty of attention for his work at Hyundai, following a stint designing Lamborghinis.

But the key factor for von Holzhausen is that as Tesla rolls out its Model 3 sedan, attacking the mass market, he's witnessing the return on his risky decision to join CEO Elon Musk back when Tesla was selling only one car, the original Roadster. Many designers of high reputation who are about von Holzhausen's age (he's 49) continue to imagine the future within the context of the past.

Von Holzhausen gets to envision the future on its own terms — gorgeous electric cars that will someday be able to drive themselves. The car designer of the coming decades might admire the legends of the profession's history (and there have been many). But when it comes to crafting a career and a reputation, they will look to Holzhausen.

I recently got the chance to speak with von Holzhausen and he shared some details about how he came to join Tesla and what guides his design philosophy.

Correction: An earlier version of this post said that von Holzhausen joined Tesla in 2010; he joined in 2008."

Headlines

Stories you might have missed from WIRED this week

Tesla sure knows how to (re)design a vehicle. Sure, the new Semi features four motors and can go from zero to 60 mph in 20 seconds while hauling 80,000 pounds. 1 But Alex saw a company designing for humans too, with thoughtful cab tweaks that should make it easier for humans to drive. At least until the company nails that autopilot thing.

About that Tesla Roadster 2.0: Musk says it goes 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds, with a max speed of 250 mph, making this one of the fastest surprises ever. Also possibly one of the fastest production cars in the world.

Lest you think Tesla’s having all the fun, Jack checked out a little trumpeted but pretty cool project at the Port of Los Angeles, where Siemens is powering three electric trucks with overhead wire, like streetcars. Other companies experiment with trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells, while still more race to build batteries powerful enough, fast-charging enough, and light enough to power a long-haul trip.

Alex reports on the startup Embark, which has been using semiautonomous trucks to haul refrigerators between a warehouse in Texas and a distribution center in California since last month. Today there’s a safety driver behind the wheel, but Embark wants to eventually let the vehicles go human-free on highways. Truck drivers will still be needed, to guide them through their last few tricky miles over surface streets.

In fact, a bunch of those working on automated trucks insist they’ll still need truck drivers, at least for the next few decades. These jobs will change, though; I explore how.

If your vehicle tastes run more toward fire engines, I hung out with the San Francisco Fire Department’s newest truck, a slightly smaller (but still red) vehicle built to make streets safer for cyclists and walkers alike.

WIRED Transportation’s Inspirational Quote of the Week

“When you wish upon a falling star, your dreams can come true. Unless it's really a meteor hurtling to the Earth which will destroy all life. Then you're pretty much hosed, no matter what you wish for. Unless it's death by meteorite."" - from a framed poster on the wall of Elon Musk’s SpaceX office, according to a recent Rolling Stone profile. Do with that what you will.

Required Reading

News from elsewhere on the internet.

If last night’s Musk-mania still got you high, that Rolling Stone piece is worth a read. It will ... bring you down. Mad genius Elon Musk is ambitious, busy, and very melancholy, coming off a heartrending breakup that has him weeping and asking for dating advice from a reporter.

A lawsuit filed this week by a former assembly worker at Tesla’s Fremont, California, plant alleges the workplace is a “hotbed of racism”. It’s the third lawsuit alleging racial discrimination brought against the carmaker by a black worker this year—and the first to seek class-action status.

Meanwhile, General Motors is upping the electric ante. CEO Mary Barra said this week that the carmaker will profit off its EVs in four years, thanks to expected battery price drops. Today, the Chevy Bolt’s batteries cost about $145 per kilowatt-hour; Barra says they should hit $100 per kilowatt-hour by 2021.

Volkswagen’s going all-in on electric—and China. The German automaker hooked up with Chinese state-owned company Anhui Jianghuai to make EVs in the spring, and now says it will spend $12 billion by 2025 to introduce 40 locally produced, low-emission vehicle models.

Oh, Canada! Lyft makes it first foray into international markets—and the Great White North—with an announcement that it will launch service in Toronto by the end of the year. (Uber already operates there.)

Want to take your Tesla for a joyride ... through the air?

In a tease that would be utterly ludicrous if it had come from practically anyone else, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted Sunday that a ""special upgrade"" of the company's new Roadster supercar may be capable of briefly flying.

The first units of the Tesla Roadster, which Musk revealed Thursday at an event in California, are supposed to arrive in 2020 at a price of $250,000. He had already promised that the car would be the fastest production car of all time, featuring a top speed of more than 250 miles per hour.

But Musk said Sunday on Twitter that a ""special upgrade package"" could ""enable it to fly short hops.""

It's ""certainly possible,"" Musk said. ""Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities.""

And Musk knows a thing or two about rockets. He is also CEO of SpaceX, which makes and flies rockets for commercial and government space ventures.

But the pursuit of a flying car would mark a turnabout for Musk, who has previously expressed skepticism about the technology.

""There is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generated will be very high,"" he said earlier this year at TED Talks.

And from a practical perspective: ""If something's flying over your head and there's a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation,"" Musk said at the time. ""You're thinking, 'Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off and guillotine me?'""

Still, if there's one thing that can be said about Musk, it's that he doesn't want to be late to the party. Other tech and auto companies, including Uber and Toyota, have begun working on flying cars.

The Roadster, an electric vehicle that would be able to travel 620 miles on a single charge, was already set to achieve incredible speeds. Tesla said the base version of the vehicle would go from 0 to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds.

Believe it or not, the vehicle would be street legal.

Flying it, however? Maybe not. You might need to head to the track for that.

American electric carmaker Tesla hopes its electric-powered trucks will replace today’s diesel-fueled ones.

Tesla founder Elon Musk showed off the new truck, called the Tesla Semi, during a launch event Thursday in Los Angeles. The company also announced a new sports car model.

Musk said the truck can travel 800 kilometers on a single electric charge while pulling a full load of 36,000 kilograms.

Musk did not give an exact price for the new trucks. Instead, he said the cost of operating the Tesla truck will be less than diesel trucks because of fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. He even claimed that moving goods with the Tesla Semi would cost less than transporting them by train.

Musk said production will begin in 2019. The company says interested buyers could pay $5,000 to reserve a truck.

Musk told a crowd gathered to see the launch he believes the new truck’s features are “better in every way” than any current transport trucks on the road.

The trucks will be equipped with the same driver-assist system built into some of Tesla’s other vehicles. The Autopilot system can keep vehicles at a set speed and is capable of slowing them down automatically. It can also keep vehicles within traffic lanes.

Musk said he can imagine that someday, several Tesla electric trucks will autonomously follow each other down the road.

He added that the company plans to build a worldwide system of solar-powered “megachargers” to provide electrical charges for the trucks. He said the system could power trucks for another 640 kilometers after charging for as little as 30 minutes.

​

Tesla and other major manufacturers are making big investments in electric vehicles in a worldwide shift to energy-saving technologies.

U.S. government information shows that trucks create nearly one fourth of all transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are blamed for trapping heat and warming the Earth’s atmosphere.

Tesla faces competition in the electric truck market however. German carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler AG are designing their own versions. Daimler recently showed off its first all-electric zero-emission transport truck in Germany.

In the U.S., Nikola Motor Company is developing electric transport trucks powered by hydrogen. It says the trucks will be able travel up to 1,900 kilometers, with a refill time of just 15 minutes.

​

A record-setting sports car also introduced

At the publicity event, Musk surprised the crowd with a new model of Tesla’s Roadster. The car unexpectedly drove out of the back of the Tesla Semi.

Musk said he was pleased to announce that Tesla was launching the second-generation Roadster, a new version of the first car the company made.

Tesla said its updated Roadster will break several world records. Musk said the sports car will be the first vehicle in regular production to reach 100 kilometers an hour in just 1.9 seconds.

Musk added that the car will have a travel range of 1,000 kilometers on a single charge, which he said would be a new record for an electric vehicle.

“You’ll be able to travel from LA to San Francisco, and back, at highway speed without recharging,” Musk said.

Tesla says it plans to begin selling the new Roadster in 2020. However, the car is probably not for everyone. Its starting price, which is for the least costly model, is $200,000.

There was even a surprise cameo from the ghost of Tesla’s Christmas past: the second generation of the Roadster. But at no point did CEO Elon Musk mention the car on which the fate of his entire company still hinges: the Model 3.

It’s not totally shocking. After all, the Model 3 had its own party earlier this year. But since then, Tesla’s first high-volume, mass-market vehicle has hit a number of snags.

Musk, the master of misdirection

When Musk launched the Model 3 in July, the company was anticipating a production rate of 20,000 cars a month by the end of December. In the last quarter, though, Tesla produced only 260 Model 3s — about three cars a day. That’s well behind a normal pace of about one car per minute. Earlier this month, Tesla pushed back its target for volume production on the Model 3 — widely seen as crucial to the company’s long-term future — by about three months to fix production bottlenecks.

In all likelihood, the unveiling of the Semi truck and the Roadster was meant to achieve two outcomes: distract investors and Wall Street analysts from the Model 3’s production woes, while also recapturing some of the excitement and magic that helped propel Tesla to its current heights as one of the most valuable automakers in the US.

“I do feel like the company needed to generate a little bit of excitement,” said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds. “[Musk] needed a shiny new object to wave in front of everyone’s faces.”

Some analysts feared that the truck and the Roadster would prove to be an expensive distraction for the company, which has never posted a profit and currently describes itself as in “production hell” trying to get the Model 3 out the door. Production of the truck and the sports car are aimed at 2019 and 2020 releases, respectively.

Tesla spent $1.1 billion on its auto business in the most recent quarter, and it expects expenses of $1 billion in the current one. The company had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30th. At the current cash-burn rate, Tesla would likely be down to about $1 billion in cash by the end of the first quarter of 2018. That’s not good, and the potential outcome of such an event helps explain the timing of the Roadster’s reveal.

“Tesla is burning cash at an alarming rate.”

“I feel there is a combination of throwing out a bright, shiny object for the media and fans to focus on and then using that as yet another way to raise capital,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst for Navigant. “Tesla is burning cash at an alarming rate and another share sale or sale of more junk bonds would be problematic.”

At the event, Musk said interested buyers could reserve a Tesla Roadster now, with a $50,000 deposit on its estimated $200,000 base price, or pick up one of the 1,000 more powerful Founders Series cars by paying the full $250,000 now. It was very clearly framed as a way for Tesla to raise a lot of money for its short-term commitments. If the company finds a thousand takers for the Founder’s series Roadsters, that’s $250 million added to Tesla’s cash balance.

“Essentially doing a Kickstarter for these cars strikes me as a cynical move by a company that is struggling to come to grips with the basics of mass manufacturing and making a profit,” Abuelsamid said. “That said, no one is holding a gun to anyone’s head and they are free to do spend their wealth however they please. There are many true believers beyond Elon himself and they want to keep funding the dream.”

For all the breathless coverage it seems to get (guilty!), it’s easy to forget how small Tesla’s impact on the automotive world really is. In the five years since Tesla started producing its Model S, the company has sold about 200,000 cars. The US has more than 250 million passenger cars on the road, making the impact of this, roughly, close to zero. Which is not to say that Tesla’s mission to liberate us from our addiction to fossil fuels isn’t noble. And the company’s ability to steer most of its competitors toward their own electrification plans is incredibly powerful and has helped solidify Tesla as a leader in sustainable transportation.

But if the company can’t get its shit together and start delivering the Model 3 in high volume, all of its efforts could be for naught. If the Model 3 fails to catch fire, demand for EVs could drop overall. States may start to reconsider tax credits and other incentives used to lure consumers to consider electric transportation. Plans to build more charging stations so people can assume a certain level of reliability may fall apart. The country could retreat further from the environmental standards and the oil and gas industry would sink its claws deeper into our institutions.

Okay, that all sounded bad. I’m not saying the future of sustainability relies on the Model 3. But in all honesty, maybe it does."

You can see how different Tesla is from the rest of the car companies at a place like the LA Auto Show. At the Tesla booth, there's no glitz, or models leaning seductively. But it's swamped during a showing for journalists.

One of three Tesla car models on display at the show is the Model 3, aimed at the mass market. It's not only the car that's supposed to take Tesla mainstream but also the one to bring it to profitability.

But CEO Elon Musk's company has missed its production goals, and analysts wonder whether he's spreading himself too thin.

Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Kelly Blue Book who is an admitted fan of Tesla and Musk, says the company's marketing plan is its bold vision.

""Nothing Tesla does is normal,"" she says. That's part of the appeal of the company. ""[Musk] pushes people to think further and faster, and we need people like that.""

Musk and Tesla have innovated many aspects of making cars and batteries. And its Model S is considered one of the best cars of the century.

But the Model 3, the new car Tesla is trying to build, is the company's make-or-break product: It's the company's promise of an affordable electric car.

Yet, the Model 3 has fallen far short of production targets, and Tesla's battery factory has been having trouble with production.

So is it possible for one man to: revolutionize the auto industry and commercial trucking, send people to Mars, create a Hyperloop and innovate the solar panel industry?

""Well, for a normal company the answer would probably be no,"" says Jeremy Anwyl with Trucks.com. But, he adds, ""Tesla is anything but normal, largely because of just the force of personality.""

He says Musk is able to take his various companies into places others just couldn't venture. The cult of personality around Musk allows him to raise capital easily and excite investors in a way that other CEOs can't.

The ability to so quickly get money from capital markets comes with risk. ""If the market ever lost just a little bit of confidence ... the ability to continue to finance the operations of the organization could get a lot, lot harder,"" Anwyl says.

Musk predicted this summer that the Model 3 would put Tesla through ""production hell."" But other car companies like Toyota, General Motors and Volkswagen don't face such difficulties.

Jeffrey Osborne, a stock analyst with Cowen, says the big automakers don't just build cars and trucks efficiently, they build assembly lines and car plants efficiently.

For Osborne, one of the analysts who's been bearish on Tesla, now is the worst time for Tesla to be having rudimentary assembly line problems.

He points to the turnover rate of top managers. Musk is ""a tough guy to work for and you know it's a company that's going warp speed. I just wish he'd pause and pay attention to the Model 3,"" Osborne says."

That figure applies to the long-range version of the Model 3, and echoes the vehicle specs released by Tesla back in July. It also makes the Model 3 one of the most efficient passenger electric vehicles on the market.

The EPA’s range is used as the advertised figure for electric vehicles that are sold in the US. The 310-mile range is an estimate of the number of miles the vehicle should be able to travel in combined city and highway driving from a full charge. That’s 131 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) for city driving, 120 MPGe on the highway, and 126 MPGe combined.

one of the most efficient passenger electric vehicles on the market

You’ll have to pay more to get that extended range, though. Tesla said it would be selling a standard version of the Model 3, with just 220 miles of range, for $35,000. The long-range version will start at $44,000, the automaker says. Production on the standard version isn’t expected to begin until 2018.

Of course, that’s assuming you’ll be able to get any version of the Model 3 in the near future. In the last quarter, Tesla produced only 260 Model 3s; that’s about three cars a day and well behind a normal pace of about one car per minute. Earlier this month, Tesla pushed back its target for volume production on the Model 3 — widely seen as crucial to the company’s long-term future — by about three months to fix production bottlenecks.

Meanwhile, GM’s Chevy Bolt, the first battery-electric car to go on sale with more than 200 miles of range at a price of less than $40,000, has been increasing its sales each quarter. Last September, Chevy delivered a whopping 2,632 Bolt EVs in what is only the car's ninth full month on sale."

It seemed its chief executive, Elon Musk, could do no wrong.

But a spate of negative news this week has brought the electric-car maker’s many challenges into focus, especially its ambitious plans to ramp up production of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, which begins rolling off the assembly line on Friday.

With investors shying away, Tesla has seen its shares fall by almost 17 percent since Monday’s intraday high, to $308.89, including a 5.6 percent drop on Thursday. That reduced the company’s market capitalization to $50.7 billion, according to Bloomberg, and put G.M. ahead once again, at $52.6 billion.

Most critical to Tesla’s troubles was a new, slower timetable for the Model 3 introduction, and a separate acknowledgment of problems manufacturing battery packs, a critical component of its cars, in the second quarter, said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar."

But it’s no repeat performance. The stunning four-seater roadster boasts jaw-dropping numbers, that if they measure up to Musk’s claims, will make it the world’s quickest production car. In his remarks, Musk described it as a “smackdown” to the fossil fuel-addicted auto industry.

will likely cause Porsche and Ferrari to break a sweat

The finale to his semi truck reveal was all about driving home that point. As the opening guitar licks of the Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” blasted over the loud speaker, a beam of red zipped across the parking lot. The second-generation Tesla Roadster came to an abrupt halt, and a grinning Elon Musk came back on the mic to introduce his latest baby, which will likely cause Porsche and Ferrari to break a sweat.

Musk claimed the base model will do 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds. If true, that would make it the first production vehicle to crack the two-second threshold. He also said the new Roadster would climb from 0 to 100 mph in 4.2 seconds, and will clear the quarter mile in 8.9 seconds (in case the Fast & Furious drag race franchise comes calling).

“It’ll be faster than that jet over there,” Musk quipped, as an airplane soared over the exultant crowd crammed into Tesla’s Hawthorne, California facility.

“It’ll be faster than that jet over there”

Musk said he wouldn’t confirm the top speed, but hinted that it was “above 250 mph.” By comparison, the Agera RS by Sweden’s Koenigsegg currently holds the world record at 277.9 mph.

As fans gasped, Musk said the Roadster had a 200kWh battery pack and a 620-mile range per charge, or over 1,000 kilometers. Again, another record shattered — or so Musk claims. Imagine driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back, without recharging, Musk teased.

The vehicle has three motors (one in the front and two in the rear), all-wheel drive, and torque steering.

The design is clear strike against the sports car industry. There are possible cues from all the majors players, including a McLaren P1 cockpit, an Acura NSX exterior, Bugatti Chiron headlights, a Targa-like roof, and a rear reminiscent of an Aston Martin DB10.

“The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.”

“The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,” Musk said. Driving any other turbo-charged sports car, is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.

But there is a wait: Musk said production isn’t scheduled to start until 2020, and production deadlines at Tesla have traditionally been optimistic. You can reserve one now for $50,000 towards the $200,000 base price – or get one of the first 1,000 Founders Series models with more performance and an asking price of $250,000 that has to be paid now.

While Model 3 customers wait, Tesla has dug in its heels and reminded its fans where the brand love all began: the 2008 Roadster. Musk has been teasing the return of Tesla’s first production car since 2011, when the vehicle ended its run. But the promised date of 2014 came and went, and instead, the electric automakers fans got the Model S, followed by the X and the 3. This evening’s semi truck unveiling was meant to signal the next stage in Musk’s “Master Plan.” As Musk has shown time and again he has learned the art of flipping the script by delivering heavy on delight.

Emphasizing the truck’s “badass” performance, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pitched the new Tesla Semi as the safest, most comfortable truck ever.

The semi is a fully electric Class 8 truck, a category of freight vehicles that weigh more than 33,000 pounds, including tractor-trailer rigs that form the backbone of commercial road freight. This one, Musk said, can haul 80,000 pounds.

Tesla’s offering has a range of 500 miles at maximum weight at highways speeds, much higher than early spec reports of a range of 300 miles. Musk said the truck has a coefficient of drag of just 0.36, making it more aerodynamic than the Bugatti Chiron, a $2.7 million supercar with a drag coefficient of 0.38.

Safety features include automatic braking, lane tracking, and “nuclear explosion-proof glass” for the windshield.

The truck can gain 400 miles of range with just a 30-minute charge from a “megacharger,” and its operating cost per mile is 20 percent below that of conventional diesel semi trucks.

""Every truck we sell will have enhanced autopilot as standard,"" Musk said. That means semi-autonomous capabilities for breaking and keeping in lanes. Using the autopilot system, several Tesla trucks can form a convoy on highways, driving the operating cost down further.

“It's not just economic suicide to use one diesel truck, it's economic suicide for rail,” Musk said. “This beats rail.”

Though Tesla says the payback period in averted fuel costs on the truck would be just two years, it did not reveal a retail price. Production is slated to begin in 2019.

At the end of the event, Musk also presented the company’s new four-seat roadster, a car with 620 miles of range that can go from zero to 60 mph in 1.8 seconds. ""The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,"" Musk said. Tesla also claims it’s the fastest production car ever made.

The semi truck is clearly a major departure from Tesla’s core consumer-oriented cars like the Model S and the Model X, which are high-end electric daily drivers that compete with luxury cars.

Tesla’s first foray into commercial vehicles puts it into competition with a different cadre of manufacturers — truck makers, rather than carmakers. And marketing trucks is quite different from marketing luxury cars. But already at least one trucking company has placed a reservation to order Semis.

It’s clear that the truck’s self-driving capabilities herald a massive change coming in the economy. The White House Council of Economic Advisers in a report last year found that vehicle automation could threaten 2.1 million to 3.3 million jobs.

Electric trucks like Tesla’s could also have big implications for the environment.

Commercial vehicles, particularly trucks, are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the US Department of Energy, Class 8 trucks transport 80 percent of all goods in the United States and account for 22 percent of total energy use in transportation, burning through 28 billion gallons of fuel each year across 2.5 million trucks, each one racking up 66,000 miles annually on the odometer.

Around the world, these trucks account for 7 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and guzzle 17 million barrels of oil per day, with demand growing by 1.9 percent per year, according to the International Energy Agency.

Musk has dropped hints about the truck throughout the year, along with hyperbolic claims that “[i]t can transform into a robot, fight aliens and make one hell of a latte.”

But the launch was delayed by a few months.

Musk attributed the delays to production issues with the Model 3 electric car as well as to Tesla’s efforts to help restore power in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck two months ago.

Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017

Much of the work on reducing the environmental impact of trucks has focused on getting existing manufacturers to make them more efficient and pollute less, but if they go all electric, pollution will drop to zero. Battery technology has only recently caught on to the needs of the commercial transport industry, and fleet vehicles could provide automakers a more robust business case. This could be an advantage for electric-first manufacturers like Tesla.

Vox’s David Roberts recently made a similar point about electrifying buses. Though we don’t have any information about the price for Tesla’s new truck, it, like electric buses, may have a higher upfront price than its diesel competitors with savings distributed across its life cycle in avoided fuel costs.

Other manufacturers are not sitting idle. Nikola Motor Company now offers a fuel cell-powered truck. The diesel engine manufacturer Cummins revealed an electric Class 7 truck in August. And the Canadian retailer Loblaw Companies Limited launched its own electric Class 8 truck last week.

The race is on."

HAWTHORNE, Calif. — Elon Musk wears many masks. Internet entrepreneur. Electric car salesman. Rocket man.

Add trucker to the list.

Musk rolled silently into a long-anticipated and oft-delayed event here Thursday at the controls of Tesla Semi. The first electric big rig truck from a company known for its luxury electric long-range cars is a shot across yet another industry bow for the brash Tesla and SpaceX CEO who has vowed to remake automobiles, solar energy and space exploration.

The new vehicle will start production in 2019, and no price tag was mentioned.

Looking like something Batman might have designed, the Tesla Semi prototype — revealed at a glitzy Hollywood-style event at a private aviation center adjacent to SpaceX headquarters in this Los Angeles suburb — is heavy on aerodynamic fairings that are said to, along with its electric engine, drive the cost-per-mile below that of today’s gas-powered machines, Tesla officials said while giving USA TODAY a walk-around before the event unfolded.

""Even with 80,000 pounds it'll get to 60 mph in 20 seconds,"" Musk said, hopping out of a truck. ""What about up a hill?""

More significantly for trucking companies, Musk said that a standard diesel truck would be 20% more expensive to operate than a Tesla truck: $1.26 per mile compared to $1.51 per mile.

Musk said that if Tesla Semis were to drive in a convoy, in which trucks can draft off each other while letting computers and sensors keep them just feet apart at highway speeds, it could compete on cost with trains. ""This beats rail,"" said Musk, throwing up an 85 cents per mile cost.

But Musk emphasized its performance. Tesla Trucks can hit 65 mph vs. 45 mph up a 5% grade compared to a standard truck, he said. Then the biggest applause and hoots accompanied this stat: a 500-mile range, at maximum weight at highway speeds.

Investors were equally enthused. Shares (TSLA) rose 2% after trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services said Friday it had already placed an order for ""multiple"" Tesla Semis.

Musk hinted at a supercharger-less trip — no recharges needed.

""You can go 250 miles, deliver your load and come back,"" he said. That said, charging to 80% would take only 30 minutes, ""or about the time of the average driver break"" on a new solar-powered Megacharger network.

More stats spilled out from there, including a 0.36 drag coefficient, a bit less than a $3 million Bugatti Chiron, thanks to a flat bottom. Musk also said the company was guaranteeing the Tesla Semi for 1 million miles.

""It's like driving a Model S or Model X, but it's just big,"" Musk said, rererring to the brand's two current models, an electric luxury sedan and SUV.

At that point, someone in the crowd yelled: ""Elon for president!"" Musk laughed.

Two trucks sat in a large hanger-like facility, alongside two examples of conventional diesel trucks. The Tesla Semis were painted menacing black and glimmering silver. One featured spidery side view mirrors while the other did not, suggesting that Tesla engineers are playing with using cameras and screens in place of traditional mirrors.

While the exterior’s smooth surfaces are eye-catching, the Tesla Semi’s interior was designed to make truck drivers swoon. In the place of a typical cramped two passenger compartment is an airy space you can walk around.

By far the biggest revolution is in the driver’s seat placement. It is dead center and far forward thanks to the absence of an engine, allowing greater road visibility. A jump seat is positioned to the right and rear of the driver.

From this central, Formula One-style driving position, it's easy to monitor two screens, one left, one right, offering details of the truck’s running condition and the trucker’s shipment details.

The Tesla Semi has the upcoming Model 3 to thank for its existence. Beyond borrowing cockpit screens, flush door handles and the car’s Autopilot system, the Semi’s powertrain consists of four Model 3 drive axles, one powering each of the four rear wheels (the front wheels are unpowered).

The battery pack for the Tesla Semi, which is located low and behind the driver, remains a mystery in terms of its construction and precise range.

But as with many Musk events, the unveiling was full of flash and scant on details, including how much the sleek big rig would cost, when it would go on sale and whether Tesla had any buyers.

While it might seem odd for a man aiming for Mars to tackle a truck, the appeal for Musk is the size of the market.

Trucking is a $700 billion a year industry in U.S., and offering a product that could offer huge fuel cost savings has the potential to upset the diesel-powered status quo.

More: Tesla unveils its electric big rig truck tonight

There are roughly 4 million big rig trucks on the road today hauling a vast majority of U.S. goods around the country, according to the Diesel Technology Forum. Almost all of them run on diesel engines. In 2017, some 260,000 new big rig trucks will be on the road, according to ACT Research.

Reacting to Musk’s challenge, Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, issued a statement saying that “diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine. … Aspirations and predictions for new fuels and technologies are high, but must be evaluated in the context of reality.”

The reality for the Tesla Semi is that while a comfortable cab and a lower cost per mile drivetrain would be welcome by most truckers and transportation companies, implementing such an overhaul faces hurdles.

Ian Wright, one of the founders of Tesla who now runs electric bus and garbage truck company Wrightspeed, welcomes the spotlight Musk has put on electrifying big vehicles, but has questions.

“By addressing some of the worst polluters you can make a much bigger (environmental) impact than changing up cars,” he says. “But no one buys trucks as a fashion statement. It will be all about how much the Tesla Semi and its batteries cost, how much their weigh, and how much that weight would cut into a trucker’s payload and therefore what he stands to make.”

Some analysts predict Musk may be onto something, with a caveat around charging. Musk has vowed to dot the U.S. with supercharging stations, thereby eliminating range-anxiety issues for motorists and now truck drivers.

“The business case for e-trucks are viable in some scenarios,” says Brian Irwin, managing director automotive and industrials at Accenture. “While the overall market might not be ready yet, this could change, and quickly, if a better charging infrastructure solves those issues and stricture regulation increases the pressure on diesel trucks.”

Other analysts note that Tesla already has competition in the space, particularly from Daimler, Volkswagen and even diesel truck stalwart Cummins. A Swedish company, Einride, has taken the EV truck to another level, eliminating the driver altogether in its prototype.

Michael Harley, group managing editor for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, says that Tesla would do well to focus “on short-haul, or last-mile, delivery which would benefit (the trucks with) regenerative breaking (which recharge batteries), low noise and emission-free EV motoring.”

Tesla itself has to prove itself with the upcoming rollout of the Model 3 sedan, an entry-level vehicle that Musk has said remains in “production hell” as some 400,000 deposit holders wait for their cars to arrive sometime in 2018 or 2019.

Musk’s company also has been hit with a range of lawsuits and complaints recently from workers who charge that Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factories have been the site of racist and sexist behavior and anti-union crackdowns.

Tesla has denied the charges, and said a recent space of layoffs were due to poor performance.

Those issues aren't likely to be resolved soon or disappear. But Thursday the spotlight was on Musk as master showman pushing yet another industry's buttons with his insatiable and visionary drive.

Boudette,"As a result, Tesla is estimating it will cost $1.26 per mile to operate, compared with $1.51 a mile for a diesel truck. The cost can fall further — to 85 cents a mile, according to Tesla — if groups of trucks travel together in convoys, which reduces wind drag. “This beats rail,” Mr. Musk said.

Tesla said it had no partnerships to announce on the truck project at this point, but an early adopter emerged Friday when Walmart said it had ordered 15 test vehicles — five for its United States operations and 10 in Canada — for use when production begins. “We believe we can learn how this technology performs within our supply chain, as well as how it could help us meet some of our long-term sustainability goals, such as lowering emissions,” said Ryan Curell, a Walmart spokesman.

In typical Tesla fashion, the truck is a sharp departure from industry norms. The cabin is spacious enough for a driver and passenger to stand. The driver’s seat is in the center of the cab, not on the left side. It is flanked by two laptop-size video screens providing navigation and scheduling data as well as images of blind spots and other areas around the truck.

It will be equipped with radar sensors, cameras and processors to enable drivers to use a version of Autopilot, the advanced driver-assistance system featured in Tesla cars such as the Model S and the new Model 3.

Autopilot can automatically steer, accelerate and brake for other vehicles and obstacles, although drivers must keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel while using the feature.

Tesla could face difficulty if it is unable to deliver on its promised range of 500 miles on a single charge. Analysts at Bernstein, an investment bank, estimated that Tesla’s truck would be able to travel 300 to 450 miles a day before needing to recharge its battery pack. “We see 300 to 450 miles a day as a significant constraint,” the bank said in a research report.

Mr. Musk said Tesla envisions building a network of superchargers for trucks across the United States and other countries. He gave few details but said they would be solar-powered. “So your truck will be running on sunshine,” he said."

But with a price on par with a Bentley or Aston Martin, the question is, can it deliver on the kind of luxury and drivability those buyers expect? That's going to take a lot more than just sternum-cracking acceleration.

Prices for the Roadster will start at $200,000, with a required deposit of $50,000. A limited edition Founders Series of the car will cost $250,000 and will have to be paid for up front and in full.

At these prices, someone could buy an Aston Martin DB11 or a Bentley Continental GT. Those cars can't match the Roadster's advertised performance figures -- but there's a lot more to a sports car than just speed.

Related: Does Tesla have enough cash to fix Model 3 production woes?

The Roadster's ability to go from zero to 60 in under two seconds is unprecedented, and would make this the quickest production car ever. It can run the quarter mile in 8.8 seconds. That's faster than a Dodge Challenger Demon, an 840-horsepower single-seat car designed especially for drag racing.

And its top speed of over 250 miles an hour puts it in the same league as the $3 million Bugatti Chiron. That figure is especially surprising, given that top speed is not an area in which electric cars tend to excel. (High speeds mean much more battery-draining wind resistance.)

Anyone who can afford to spend a quarter million dollars on a car is used to high level of quality of craftsmanship. That means Tesla needs to overcome the production issues it is currently having with the far simpler Model 3, as well as the sort of quality issues it's been having with the complex Model X.

Tesla sued over Model 3 delays

Sports cars also need to corner well and give the driver a sense of confidence and control. Tesla's original Roadster, produced from 2008 to 2012, was built on the skeleton of a British Lotus sports car. Lotus is legendary for how well its cars handled, and for an obsession with light weight, which also helps with cornering and control. For a company building a high-end sports car, there could hardly be a better place to start. This Roadster will presumably be all Tesla (TSLA).

Electric drive does provide some advantages for a sports car. First, most sports cars have an engine that concentrates weight somewhere in the car. A lot of sports car design is about how to carry that big block of metal through turns at high speeds. Engineers and designers work hard to position the engine as low as possible in the car, and in a place that will give the car stable, controllable and predictable cornering characteristics.

Tesla reveals semi-truck and new sports car

In an electric car, the weight is concentrated in battery packs, but those batteries don't need to be all together. In Tesla's other vehicles, they're spread out under the floor of the car, giving them a very low center of gravity and weight that's evenly balanced.

But, batteries are heavy and weight is still a problem, no matter where it is. That's why electric cars are, generally speaking, heavier than gasoline powered cars. Tesla engineers will still have to overcome, or minimize, the sheer weight that will come with that level of range and performance.

Still, based on Tesla's claims, the Roadster certainly the potential to be a big winner for Tesla that could help generate the profits it so badly needs and even more buzz."

Contributor, Innovations

Tesla’s stock price recently took a hit because of concerns about its delivery capabilities and about increasing competition from carmakers who are switching their product lines to electric. With a market cap still exceeding $50 billion, it can be easy to argue that Tesla’s price remains severely inflated, especially when you compare it with those of GM and Ford — which produce 20 times more revenue. You can understand why Tesla remains one of the most shorted stocks — with billions of dollars in bets against it.

But Tesla has an advantage that many people don’t understand: It is much more than an automotive company; it is a technology company building technology platforms. With these, it is positioning itself to also become the leading player in the energy industry and sharing economy. It will bring the same integration, data analysis and elegance to these industries as it did to cars.

I have referred to my Tesla Model S as “a spaceship that travels on land.” It drives differently from any other kind of car, and is lightning fast, smooth and slick. To me, other electric vehicles, such as the BMW i3, the Mercedes B-Class, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Bolt, all of which I have driven, seem by comparison to be a clumsy repackaging of old technologies. They feel more like cassette players than iPods. I have every expectation that Tesla’s Model 3, which I have on order, will be almost as good as my Model S, despite costing half as much.

Tesla cars have been designed from the ground up as computers on wheels. Almost every function is controlled by software, and this enables the company to continually analyze data and optimize its functioning — just as Google Search and Apple Siri do. With the billions of miles’ worth of driving data it is gathering, Tesla is on track to deliver full autonomous driving capability earlier than many other car manufacturers will. And because all of its new cars, including the Model 3, come equipped with the sensors that will be necessary to the autopilot software once it’s released, Tesla has a considerable advantage over its rivals.

In July 2016, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would use these technologies to enable a ride-sharing platform called the Tesla Network, through which owners will be able to rent out their cars as autonomous taxis, thereby recouping their investments and even making profits from their cars. As he explained, “Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5 percent to 10 percent of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.” With highly sought-after cars and a head start, Tesla could grab a significant share of the vehicle-sharing economy — an economy that is expected to transform the transportation industry and disrupt the automobile market.

Tesla is already diversifying its businesses so that it doesn’t sink with the automotive industry when this happens. Underlying the Tesla cars is another technology platform that it is commercializing: the battery. Tesla’s Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that provides homes with the storage of solar-captured energy for use at night or during power outages. This complements the solar roof tiles that Tesla is selling, which look like ordinary tiles and are priced competitively. So what you have is what Musk has called “a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works.” This is the kind of advantage and elegance that came with the Apple iPhone, which integrated music, telephony, and computer applications into one device.

In the same way as Tesla could make car ownership a revenue generator for its drivers, it could do the same for solar power. Homeowners could share their excess energy with other homeowners and provide charging stations for others’ Tesla vehicles. This would also dramatically expand the Tesla supercharger network, enabling charging of cars almost anywhere.

On a larger scale, Tesla is offering utility companies grid-scale energy-storage systems, demand for which will enable it to scale up its production and gain a cost advantage. It has just won a bid to provide the government of South Australia with the world’s largest lithium-ion battery system — 129 MWh of storage, deliverable at up to 100MW, enough to power more than 30,000 homes. Musk committed to having the system installed in a record 100 days. And the data Tesla gathers from this installation will allow it to optimize energy-storage operations as its self-driving data enables it to optimize its cars.

Yes, Tesla has had production issues and missed delivery targets. But that is how technology companies work: They iterate until they get things right; they think big, take risks and change the world. They make extremely optimistic projections and often miss these, and this is what causes investors to panic and short stocks.

Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the percentage decline in Tesla’s stock price from its September peak.

Tesla, the upstart that has defied the unwritten rules of the auto industry, is finishing up a year in which the challenges of manufacturing a mass-market electric car in large quantities finally hit home.

After years of bragging about its advanced manufacturing techniques, the Silicon Valley automaker faces a reality check when it comes to making its first mainstream car, the Model 3 electric sedan.

With output failing by a wide margin to meet Musk's promise of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of December, Tesla could be facing a make-or-break 2018. The new year may determine whether the company will need to again go hunting for cash and whether it maintains its leadership position in electric vehicles.

Speeding the rollout of the Model 3, which at about $35,000 will be roughly half the starting price of Tesla's luxury models, is essential to company's financial health. Reason: Tesla lost several million dollars per day in the third quarter in its rush to begin manufacturing.

""Is this the year investors will say, 'Enough’s enough,' or will they continue to fund Tesla?"" Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said. ""That’s the big question. I suspect investors would continue funding them if they see progress on the Model 3.""

So far, investor enthusiasm remains high. Tesla briefly passed General Motors as the most valuable automaker in the U.S., as measured by stock price and shares outstanding, in April. Tesla shares sailed to an interday high of $389.61 in September but have since settled back 20% to about $312 on Wednesday.

At present, Tesla is valued at about $53.3 billion, less than GM, at $59.4 billion.

Now Tesla's main focus is on the Model 3, which will require successfully exiting what CEO Elon Musk has called ""production hell."" The problems are in stark contrast to the successes that the company has scored in producing two luxury electric-vehicle models, defying the conventional auto industry in the process, and selling cars direct to the public rather than through dealers.

Tesla, which declined an interview request, has denied reports that workers at the automaker's Fremont, Calif. factory were assembling some parts by hand at one point. But Tesla did acknowledge it hit significant ""bottlenecks"" in production and Musk said that at one point he was ""really depressed"" about it.

More: Elon Musk promises to make a Tesla pickup truck, said he is 'dying to build' one

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas estimated in a report Dec. 15 that Tesla would make 8,000 Model 3 vehicles in the entire first quarter, falling tens of thousands short of the company's initial hope. He also estimated that Tesla will burn through another $1.1 billion in free cash flow next year, but that it has ""substantial flexibility"" when it comes to liquidity and avoiding a cash crunch.

Musk has blamed the company's underwhelming Model 3 production partially on an unidentified supplier that failed to live up to expectations, causing insufficient production of the critical lithium batteries made at Tesla's Reno, Nev. factory.

""It's our fault for picking the wrong supplier and then not realizing it until way later in the game,"" Musk told investors in November.

He also acknowledged that the company had struggled to perfect the newly automated and supposedly extremely advanced processes it designed to make the Model 3.

""There's vastly more automation with Model 3,"" he said. ""Either the machine works or it doesn't [and] it's lumping along and we get short quite severely on output.""

Separately responding to a Twitter follower on Tuesday, Musk tweeted he's ""dying to build"" an electric pickup truck. Musk suggested he would tackle that job after the Model Y, a Tesla crossover SUV that he has hinted about via both Twitter and on a Tesla conference call earlier this year.

I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017

For Tesla to get things right in 2018, it will have to avoid production miscues and pick the right suppliers. That's how the world's biggest automakers do business.

The company's future is riding on it. Here are the keys to Tesla staying on track in 2018:

Model 3 production must be fixed — and fast.

The longer the sluggish output continues, the more likely the company will lose customers who have placed refundable $1,000 deposits to reserve their place in line. Although Tesla fans are loyal, loyalty has limits.

Another factor: Tesla desperately needs to begin offsetting the red ink from its costly production expansion with sales revenue. Without it, the automaker could run out of cash very quickly, potentially forcing it to issue more debt or sell more stock to raise capital.

""2018 should be a year of reckoning for Tesla,"" AutoPacific analyst Dave Sullivan said in an email. ""This will be the year that Model 3 has to hit production targets. If anyone expects their cash burn to suddenly stop, I believe they will be very disappointed.""

Elon Musk can't spread himself too thin.

The visionary innovator leads Tesla, which has been merged with rooftop solar energy company Solar City, and rocket maker and launch company SpaceX. He's also building a tunnel-making outfit called the Boring Company, developing a brain stimulation start-up called Neuralink and funding a nonprofit designed to educate people about the benefits and dangers of artificial intelligence.

Inside of Tesla, he's developing a wide range of products, as well, including the company's new semi-truck, solar roof tiles, autonomous vehicle technology and a new Roadster supercar.

It's all potentially worthwhile and promising. But is it too much? And does he risk becoming distracted from the basic execution of manufacturing new cars?

""He’s got these big visions and on multiple fronts,"" Krebs said. ""He is spinning a lot of plates that are all tied into his vision of the future. But at the end of the day you have to get down to the nitty-gritty of making things.""

Labor strife must be avoided.

After Tesla fired hundreds of employees at once in the fall, questions arose about the company's relationship with its workforce.

The Detroit-based United Auto Workers, which is aiming to unionize Tesla's Fremont plant, accused the automaker of firing employees who were rallying workers to the union's side. The UAW filed unfair labor practice charges against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board.

UAW President Dennis Williams told reporters on Dec. 20 that Tesla employees ""are very concerned about health and safety in that plant and other issues.""

Musk has blasted the suggestion that the firings were inappropriate, saying the company has ""an extremely high standard"" and that workers were let go after customary annual performance reviews.

Tesla's standards are ""not high because we believe in being mean to people,"" he said. ""They're high because if they're not high, we will die.""

Keeping allies happy

Although Tesla did not publicly identify the supplier it blamed for production bottlenecks, it's not the first time the company has had a falling out with a key partner.

For Tesla to meet its goals, the company must maintain strong relationships with its allies. But there are signs some of its friends are keeping their options open.

For example, Tesla is engaged in a battery partnership with Panasonic at its Reno facility. That alliance is critical to the company's performance and it can't afford any problems there.

But Panasonic turned heads in December by striking a battery partnership with Japanese automaker Toyota.

While Panasonic said the deal did not affect its collaboration with Tesla, the move put Tesla on notice: Suppliers have other ways to make money.

If Tesla failed to meet the deadline, Australia would get its money back, no questions asked.

Tesla came through, and after initial testing, the record-setting battery was switched on earlier this month. It was just in time, too, as South Australia’s brutal summers begin in December. In fact, within two weeks of going online, the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery system (as it’s officially called) was put to its first test. On Dec. 14, one of the coal-power units at Loy Yang, one of the biggest power stations in Australia tripped up, causing a sudden and massive drop of power—560 MW, enough to power some 170,000 Australian homes.

This was exactly the type of problem the Tesla battery was built to solve; the Twitter bet was made after Musk announced publicly that his batteries could solve South Australia’s chronic summer power-outage problems. Tesla passed with flying colors. In literally less than a blink of the eye—it happened so fast the Australian energy market regulator couldn’t time it—the Tesla battery, 620 miles (about 1,000 km) away from the coal plant, shot a 7 MW jolt of electricity into the grid, stopping the bleeding and starting the grid back on its way to recovery.

Then, on Dec. 22, it happened again: a different coal unit at Loy Yang tripped, this time causing a 353 MW loss in capacity, and again, the Tesla battery came to the rescue, responding in milliseconds with a 16 MW injection to keep the grid under control.

Almost all grids have a backup power source contracted to sit dormant during periods of low-energy need, and kick into gear when needed. In most cases, these backups are fossil-fuel “peaking power plants”—fossil fuels remain the most reliable way to provide energy in emergencies. The success of Tesla’s battery system, which is charged by wind power, could be seen as a proof-of-concept that a renewable-plus-battery-storage system could replace the need for backup fossil-fuel plants.

The Tesla battery is technically only contracted for a few specific services to the local grid, so the Hornsdale Power Reserve didn’t have to help out in the case of this larger Australian energy failure. And in fact, it really couldn’t have solved the problem on its own.

As fast and clean and big as the Tesla battery is, it’s still pretty measly in the grand scheme of things. It can power about 30,000 homes, but 70 MW of the 100 MW/129 MWh system can only last 10 minutes; the other 30 MW can provide three hours of power. In that region, at that time (based on Australia’s Frequency Control Ancillary Services market), the contracted backup to the grid was a coal plant at the Gladstone Power Station, which in these two recent cases, did kick in a few seconds after the Tesla battery, relieving the battery of its duties.

In other words, the lithium ion battery farm is a great backup—maybe the world’s best, given its speed—but still needs to be bailed out by fossil fuels, eventually.

Another issue is that batteries attached to wind power generators, like this one, are inherently unstable. As Akshat Rathi reported for Quartz earlier this month, lithium ion batteries can only hold energy for a few weeks at most, and they start to lose their charge as soon as the charging source is removed. If the wind stops blowing in Adelaide, Musk’s big battery becomes useless. So for now—until either battery prices drop significantly or we devise a way for them to hold charges for longer—these sorts of systems are really only good as backup for peak energy periods, like summer in Australia. That’s why we haven’t seen battery farms sprouting up all over the place: governments and utilities don’t want to spend money on something that’s useless for most of the year.

That said, some analysts say the costs of renewable energy and batteries will drop fast enough that these systems could compete with fossil fuel “peaker plants” as soon as 2025. And Tesla’s success in South Australia already has many clamoring for government interventions into the energy market that would make Tesla-like systems more financially feasible, and help speed up the death of fossil fuels.

This story has been updated to clarify the size of the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery system, and the nature of the Gladstone Power Station’s role as grid backup."

Tesla founder Elon Musk says his company will build an electric pickup truck, feeding interest among the entrepreneur's fans and sparking speculation about when it might be produced. Tesla is still working to get several vehicles to market, including its Roadster and Semi.

Musk made the remark on Twitter, responding to a request for a pickup truck by saying, ""I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y.""

The Model Y is Tesla's planned crossover SUV that will be based on the same architecture as the Model 3 — the family sedan that was supposed to herald the company's entry into the mass market but ran into production snags after it hit the streets in the second half of 2017.

Tweeting about his plans for a pickup, Musk said, ""Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.""

Musk's tweet about the pickup has been liked more than 12,000 times in the 24 hours since he posted it. The tweet hit a sweet spot for people who are fans of both Tesla and pickups, scratching an itch that has generated a number of theoretical renderings of what a Tesla pickup truck might be like — including a complete photo gallery.

Responding to questions about the unnamed pickup, Musk later predicted that the truck would be similar in size to Ford's stalwart F-150 — and in the sort of tease at which he is an expert in delivering to Tesla's faithful, Musk added, ""Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I'd like to add.""

In November, Tesla unveiled two vehicles — the Semi truck and the Roadster — that Musk said would hit the U.S. market in 2019 and 2020."

Boudette,"The Model 3 will be priced around $35,000. Mr. Musk envisions it reaching a much wider range of customers and has said he expects it to push Tesla’s output to 500,000 cars a year in 2018.

In June, Mr. Musk told shareholders that Model 3 production was set to begin in July at the company’s assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., although he stopped short of saying when the car would be available in volume.

Mr. Musk has said Tesla is working to automate its assembly plant further to increase Model 3 output. He said at the shareholder meeting that the company was beginning to consider additional assembly plants.

“There is no room at Fremont,” he said. “We are bursting at the seams.”

Tesla has had discussions with Chinese officials about opening a plant near Shanghai. China accounted for about 15 percent of Tesla’s revenue in 2016.

To prepare for the addition of the Model 3 to its lineup, Tesla built a huge, $5 billion factory in Nevada to produce batteries for its electric cars. Tesla has also bolstered its coffers. This year, it raised $1 billion through offerings of stock and debt. A Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings, acquired a 5 percent stake in the company.

The company needs the extra capital because it continues to post losses in most quarters. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla lost $397 million, compared with a loss of $282 million in the period a year earlier, but its revenue more than doubled, to $2.7 billion.

Even with the swoon in shares Monday, investor optimism about the Model 3 has pushed Tesla shares up about 65 percent this year. The company has a market value of $58 billion, about $4 billion more than G.M. and $12 billion more than Ford Motor."

CEO Elon Musk revealed Sunday that its much-anticipated mid-market sedan, the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, will reach its first buyers on July 28. That’s on track with the company’s previous estimates despite delays and production woes with its previous model, the Model X SUV.

Musk also noted on Twitter Sunday that the Model 3 had passed regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. So far, Tesla stock has jumped about 2% on the news.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the company’s first major push into broadening its consumer base. Here’s what you need to know.

The Tesla Model 3 price is less than its predecessors…

The base price for the Tesla Model 3 is reportedly $35,000, which is significantly lower than its previous models. The Model S can be had for $68,000, and the Model X costs about $82,500. Still, the Model 3’s $35,000 figure assumes that the buyer wants to add no bells and whistles. Last year, Musk estimated that the average Model 3 would cost closer to about $42,000.

That said, buyers might actually be prepared to pay even more than that. According to a recent survey of over 10,000 Tesla lovers on Model3tracker.com, the average buyer is actually holding about $50,176 in preparation of the Model 3. Some buyers may be eligible for state or federal alternative energy incentives, however.

…and there’s already a backlog of orders

According to an update from Tesla in May 2016, about 373,000 people want to buy the Model 3. For context, the electric automaker produced about 84,000 cars in 2016.

That likely means that some who reserved their Model 3 car late (reservations first opened in mid-2016) may have to wait until mid 2018 or later to actually receive their vehicles. As for everyone else, it remains to be see who will get their cars first. Though in the past, Tesla has suggested its California customers and existing Tesla owners may get preference.

Musk is well aware of this backlog of reservations for the Model 3. It’s part of the reason why the CEO is retooling production and removing some steps of traditional car making. But by the end of July, the CEO said he plans to deliver 30 cars, upping that number to 100 the next month. By September, Tesla plans to deliver 1,500 cars, with 20,000 by December, Musk wrote on Twitter.

The company plans to be building about 500,000 cars in 2018.

The Model 3 is a more affordable version of the Tesla Model S

Musk has described the Tesla Model 3 as “a smaller, more affordable version of Model S with less range and power and fewer features.” He added that the “Model S has more advanced technology.”

While the Model 3 will still be equipped with Tesla’s autopilot system, it won’t have any significant new technology or features. It will also be slightly slower than its predecessor, going from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds, compared to 2.3-4.3 seconds with the Model S.

The Model 3 will be able to drive 215 miles in a single charge.

In terms of size, the Model 3 will be 184.8 inches in length with room for five adults, which is a little less than the five adults and two children that fit in the Model S thanks to its rear-facing seats.

And as for the Tesla Model 3 interior and exterior—well, pictures speak louder than words.

Tesla’s revenue could skyrocket

Tesla reported revenue of $7 billion for the full 2016 year.

Based on Musk’s estimates and Tesla’s most recent report on reservations, the Model 3 alone will result in revenue of about $15.7 billion over the course of the next two years. Granted, those statistics are outdated. The reservation figure is from 2016—suggesting that the revenue from the Model 3 could be even higher than that.

Revenue, however, is not the same as profit. Although it’s unclear exactly how much it will cost Tesla to build a Model 3, UBS projects that for the company to break even, Tesla will have to raise the price of the Model 3 to $41,000."

The long-awaited electric car that’s priced for the mass market is expected to roll off the factory floor on Friday, Elon Musk said.

Musk said the $35,000 Model 3 passed regulatory requirements two weeks ahead of schedule and that the first 30 owners will receive their cars during a handover party on July 28, Musk said, paving the way for an ambitious production timeline. Musk had said earlier this year that the Model 3 would arrive by July. The company appears to be making good on its stated trajectory, even as Tesla has been beset by production delays and has overshot schedules in the past.

Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017

After the initial rollout, Tesla is slated to produce more than 1,500 Model 3 cars in September, and by the year’s end, Musk expects the company to produce 20,000 units every month. Demand is so high for the vehicle, Musk has said, that customers who put down $1,000 to reserve one now won’t see their cars until late next year. Tesla hasn’t released order numbers since May 2016, when it said that 373,000 Model 3 reservations had been placed.

By 2018, the automaker is aiming to have produced a half-million cars, an enormous leap over last year, when the company produced about 84,000 units.

While some experts say that Tesla has learned from the production issues it faced with its SUV, the Model X, others have questioned the company’s ability to sustain demand and to squeeze profits from its cutting-edge autos. “To produce niche cars like the Model X and the Model S is one thing, but to roll out a mass-market mainstream car is way more challenging from a production standpoint,” said Jessica Caldwell, the director of industry analysis with the auto-research website Edmunds.com.

Tesla declined to comment beyond Musk’s tweets.

[Ignored warnings a factor in deadly Tesla crash, a challenge for partially-automated cars]

Tesla says the five-seater will boast a range of 215 miles per charge. Early Model 3 customers can choose the car’s color and wheel size. Later customizations include two motor options: one optimized for highway driving and the other for stop-and-go traffic, Musk said during the annual shareholders meeting last month.

But it’s unclear how these configurations will mark up the entry-level $35,000 price tag. Additional costs for Model 3 add-ons could undercut the car’s selling point as an affordable vehicle for a wide range of customers, Caldwell said. Buyers will be eligible for a full $7,500 federal tax credit up until Tesla reaches its 200,000th electric vehicle sold in the United States.

Investor anticipation and optimism around the Model 3 have lifted Tesla’s stock price to record highs. Tesla shares were up after Musk’s tweets on Monday but then dropped, closing down 2.5 percent to $352.62 a share. Still, the company’s stock is up more than 64 percent this year, driving Tesla’s value, now at nearly $60 billion, above some of the biggest automotive players in Detroit. General Motors is valued at $54 billion, and Ford is worth $46 billion.

Pulling off a successful launch of the Model 3, and sustaining high-volume production is crucial to Tesla’s broader goal of widespread adoption of electric cars, Caldwell said. “In order to promote electric vehicles, it has to go to the mainstream, and right now they are only selling expensive cars to a very limited, wealthy audience.”

In another sign of Tesla’s ambition, the company plans to unveil a working prototype of its semi-truck model at an event in September. Musk also hinted that the event would showcase a surprise announcement. Teasing the audience at the June shareholder meeting, Musk said: “I’d really recommend showing up for the semi-truck unveiling. Maybe there’s a little more than we are saying here.”

Production is then expected to grow exponentially: 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 by September, and then 20,000 per month by December.

Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017

Tesla is expected to dramatically increase Model 3 production in 2018 with total Tesla vehicle production approaching 500,000 units annually. The Model 3 already has over 400,000 pre-orders with Tesla’s rabid fanbase clamoring for any glimpse or tidbit of news related to the upcoming vehicle.

The Model 3 was first unveiled over a year ago at a lavish event at Tesla’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California. At the time, Musk said he was ""fairly confident"" that deliveries will begin by the end of 2017, and ""you will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000, even with no options.""

At a shareholder meeting last month, Musk said the first Model 3 customers would be limited in their ability to customize their orders — basically just color and wheel type. “I should say that we’ve kept the initial configurations of the Model 3 very simple,” Musk said. “A big mistake we made with the X, which is primarily my responsibility — there was way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish.”

Tesla’s sky-high valuation — it recently surpassed BMW’s market cap — depends largely on Musk’s ability to sell his vision of sustainable, battery-powered driving to a much broader population. The two current Tesla vehicles, the Model S and Model X, are both extremely expensive. Even with tax incentives, both cars easily push $100,000. The Model 3 will start at $35,000, making it the cheapest in Tesla’s range.

In order for Tesla to sell ten times as many cars as it does now, it needs a much cheaper automobile. That's the Model 3. It's the future of the company."

The vehicle, which will cost around $35,000, is Tesla’s first attempt at winning over mainstream car buyers. In the past, the automaker has produced vehicles squarely targeted at the luxury end of the market—with its Model S costing almost $70,000 before any extras are added.

Tesla will deliver the new Model 3 sedan to its first 30 customers on July 28, which just meets the promised July deadline set out by Musk. But in building a populist car, the company must make it in quantity—indeed, 400,000 people have already paid $1,000 deposits to secure one of the vehicles.

The projections for increasing output are as ambitiously Muskian as ever. The automaker will build just 100 of the cars in August, but it hopes to increase that to 1,500 in September, then 20,000 in December. In 2018, it aims to pump out 500,000 of the vehicles in total, and then increase that to one million by 2020.

Musk says that Tesla’s highly automated production line has been designed to make that possible. The Model 3 production line is intended to use fewer and fewer humans as time goes on—ideally until there are none to get in the way of the robots. “You can't have people in the production line itself, otherwise you drop to people speed,” he has said.

But as we’ve explained in the past, it is unclear whether Tesla’s facilities can keep up with the dramatic rates of increased production that Musk promises. While America’s largest auto plants do crank out more than 500,000 vehicles a year, they are established and stress-tested facilities that have slowly built up to that capacity. Tesla, meanwhile, will be debugging its facilities while increasing output at breakneck speed.

It’s not impossible, and if anyone can do it, it probably is Musk. He is, after all, a man who said he’d recycle rocket boosters, received incredulity from incumbents in the space industry, and then went right ahead and showed them all it was possible. Scratch that: he made it look easy.

But Musk has a hit-and-miss track record when it comes to meeting his self-imposed deadlines. While Tesla may this week hit its target for having the vehicle first roll off the assembly line, ensuring that they keep rolling at a fast enough rate will be quite another challenge.

Tesla's third-quarter delivery numbers were both impressive and depressing. The carmaker is on pace to sell 100,000 vehicles annually for the first time in its 14-year history. But it's also far, far behind with the production of its new Model 3 sedan, the vehicle that's supposed to bring Tesla to the masses and spell the beginning of the end for gas-powered cars.

Tesla said it would produce 1,500 Model 3s in September — it has produced fewer than 300 since launching the car in July.

Getting to 20,000 in monthly production by December now seems like a hopeless expectation, as does CEO Elon Musk's prediction that Tesla will manufacture 500,000 vehicles annually by the end of 2018.

This means the half-million preorders for the Model 3 could go unfulfilled for several years, putting many $1,000 refundable deposits for each new car in doubt. That threat is real, but the markets are unconcerned. Tesla stock is still up 65% in 2017, and the brand has lost none of its captivating aura.

But a carmaker that has been around for as long as Tesla should be good at something that Tesla clearly isn't: building vehicles.

So why is Tesla struggling to build the Model 3 on its own admittedly ambitious schedule? There are five main reasons."

(SATIRE)—Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Tesla Motors, is revered for his visionary ideas: a mass-market electric car, a private space transport company, a mode of regional transportation that relies on vacuum-sealed tubes.

On Monday, Musk revealed his latest groundbreaking concept in a bid to once again transform the automobile industry: a gasoline-powered car.

At a press conference held at the automaker’s headquarters, Musk announced that Tesla will begin mass production of a gas-powered vehicle in 2022. He plans to call this vehicle the Model T.

“We can definitely make a innovative new car, but that’s not the hard part,” Musk said. “The hard part is, how do you make an innovative new car that Americans actually want to buy? We think we have the answer.”

He added: “The Model T will be super next level.” (Henry Ford was unavailable for comment.)

Famous for its ambitious projects, Tesla’s success has not been without growing pains. The automaker has been struggling to keep up with the demand for its latest electric vehicle, the Model 3. A recent Wall Street Journal report claimed that parts of the car were built “by hand,” rather than on its automated assembly lines; Musk denied the report, adding, “Even if we did, that makes our cars artisanal.”

To stanch the tide of criticism, Musk said Tesla has been searching for a low-cost, efficient way to serve customers in need of a new ride. Gasoline might be the answer.

“I’ve been criticized for my plans for Mars travel and Hyperloop transport,” Musk said during the press conference. “I understand these concepts are too advanced for some. So I went back to the drawing board.”

When asked if Tesla risks besmirching a brand built on electricity, Musk dismissed the idea.

“Honestly, a lot of people don’t really seem to care if their cars are electric,” Musk remarked. “So while this gas-powered vehicle might look like a step backwards, I take solace in knowing the profits will help me eventually transport people via pneumatic tube, whether they want it or not.”

The Model T will be the company’s first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine. The model specifications boast a capacity of five passengers and roughly 31 miles per gallon on the highway. The vehicle will not have any autopilot capabilities (the company’s signature “Ludicrous Mode” has been swapped out for “Sensible Mode”) nor software available for over-the-air updates.

“Apparently, analog technology is what some people want,” said an exasperated Musk, who was reportedly seen hurling his Diet Coke into a wall after the press conference was over.

The Tesla Model T is already in high demand. Upon hearing news of planned production, Urban Outfitters committed to purchase 400,000 of the vehicles.

“Today’s millennials yearn for the styles of yesteryear,” said an Urban Outfitters spokesperson. “Just like the vinyl record player, gas-powered vehicles with average fuel economy are very much cool again.”

The Model T has also seen support from a demographic previously underserved by Tesla: Americans who love to consume fossil fuels.

“When it comes to my car, it’s gotta be two things: American and gas-powered,” said one customer who pre-ordered a Model T. “But Tesla’s cars run on electricity, which I didn’t know when I bought one. Each week I end up buying gallons of gas that I can’t even use. I just pour it all down the drain. Once I have a Model T, I can stop doing that.”

Tesla noted that all pre-order sales are final, and that it will not issue refunds if legislation banning gas-powered vehicles is signed before 2022.

In a statement on Thursday, Tesla said it needed to set up more overseas factories to make cars that customers could afford. Such a strategy is a must in China, which charges steep tariffs for imported cars.

“Tesla is working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in the region to serve the Chinese market,” a company spokesman said. “Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets.”

“While we expect most of our production to remain in the U.S., we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve,” the spokesman said."

Tesla has said it wants to build electric cars in China to avoid a 25-percent tariff on imported vehicles.

The company did not provide a timeline for setting up a China plant, but said it expects to “more clearly define” its China production plans by the end of the year.

Tesla shares closed up 1.7 percent at $382.61 in Thursday trading.

China’s central government requires foreign companies such as Tesla to have a Chinese partner in new auto manufacturing ventures, with the foreign company owning no more than 50 percent.

Tesla did not say which companies it might partner with, sparking rampant online speculation. At least three companies - Shanghai Electric Group Co (601727.SS), Shanghai Lingang Holdings Co (600848.SS) and Tianjin Motor Dies Co (002510.SZ) - reported in exchange filings that they were not in touch with Tesla about its plans in response to media reports implicating them.

Much of the speculation has centered on Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK), the internet giant that is China’s largest company. Earlier this year, Tencent acquired a five-percent stake in Tesla for $1.8 billion.

Tesla has not said which vehicles it plans to build in China. However, a supplier familiar with the company’s thinking said it was considering the Model 3 sedan and a crossover companion called Model Y. The Model 3 is slated to begin production in July at Tesla’s Fremont plant in California, with the Model Y tentatively scheduled to follow in mid-2019.

In a separate but related development, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Thursday he was concerned about Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) announcement earlier this week that it will move some production of its Focus small car to China and import the vehicles to the United States.

“If it happened for reasons that are non-economic reasons, then I think the administration should take action,” Lighthizer told U.S. lawmakers.

The official confirmation, which was provided in an emailed statement, puts to rest months of speculation that Tesla was going to open a factory in the world’s largest automotive market.

The electric automaker and energy storage company said it expects to “more clearly define its plans for producing electric vehicles in China by the end of the year.” The news of the talks was first reported by Reuters.

“Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets,” the company said in an emailed statement. “While we expect most of our production to remain in the US, we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve.”

It isn’t immediately clear if Tesla would take on a local partner as part of a joint venture in China, a long-held requirement for foreign companies wanting to set up shop there.

Today, Tesla produces all of its cars in the US. However, if the company hopes to increase its production to 500,000 vehicles a year — that’s a six-fold increase over 2016 numbers — and reach more consumers in Europe and Asia, it will have to open factories closer to those customers.

A factory in China should theoretically help Tesla sell more cars there. Today, the company has to pay a 25 percent tariff on the cars it imports, which in turn, raises the price tag of the vehicles.

Rumors of an impending deal with China heated up in April after Musk made an unexpected visit to the country and met with Vice Premier Wang Yang, a high-ranking government official. Just a month before, Tesla disclosed that Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings bought a 5 percent stake in the company.

Tesla had a rough start in China. Sales fell short in 2014 despite an aggressive effort to open service centers and stores, roll out its fast-charging stations known as Superchargers, and kick off a hiring spree that led to more than 600 staff.

However, Tesla turned its sluggish sales around and had a breakthrough year in 2016 with sales topping $1 billion — three times higher than 2015, according to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. While the US is still Tesla’s largest market, China has vast potential thanks to the growing percentage of car ownership and the country’s effort to improve air quality and encourage sales of electric and hybrid vehicles."

Yesterday (June 22) the company confirmed that it is “in talks” with the municipal government of Shanghai to manufacture its vehicles in the country. A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement:

“Tesla is working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in the region to serve the Chinese market. As we’ve said before, we expect to more clearly define our plans for production in China by the end of the year. Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets. While we expect most of our production to remain in the US, we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve.”

The announcement follows more than a year of speculation that the electric-vehicle maker would set up shop in China, and confirms that Tesla is altering its China strategy away from merely exporting vehicles in order to reach more Chinese consumers.. Earlier this year, Musk made a stealth visit to China to visit Wang Yang, one of the nation’s highest-ranking officials, to discuss Tesla’s plans.

Tesla has been selling vehicles in China since 2014, but to date, its share of the electric vehicle market remains marginal, at just 2% as of June 2016, according to trade blog CleanTechnica. There are several reasons for this, one of which is price. Tesla currently exports its vehicles to China, and the government places an import tax of 25% on Tesla cars. The sticker price for the most simple Model S in China is $104,972, compared to $69,500 in the US.

As a result, Tesla sales primarily go to wealthy, status-conscious consumers. While that’s still a huge group of people in China, price-conscious middle-class buyers have dozens of cheaper, homegrown competitors to choose from—including models from BYD, which only makes electric vehicles, as well electric models from car makers like Geely, Chery, and Zotye.

The only way to dodge this tax is to manufacture in China, and the only way to manufacture in China is to form a joint venture with a domestic Chinese carmaker (usually one affiliated with a city government), with foreign ownership capped at under 50%.

Tesla has indeed turned a corner in China after years of lackluster sales. Fortune cites data from research firm JL Warren Capital estimating that Tesla tripled its annual sales in China in 2016, selling 10,400 cars—amounting to 13% of its worldwide sales. The jump in demand will likely only heighten the company’s desire to manufacture in China. Meanwhile, thanks to subsidies and incentives, China’s electric-vehicle market is booming—new registrations have far surpassed that of the US.

Tesla did not answer questions about whom it would form a joint venture with (or if it would form one at all), or its expected start date for manufacturing. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the company was considering setting up a plant in the Linggang development zone, one of many fledgling government-backed hubs for manufacturing and technology.

Investors are seeing dollar signs. On June 22, the day Tesla confirmed its plans, shares of Tesla closed 1.64% higher from the day prior, and 3.65% higher than the close just before Bloomberg first reported Tesla’s ambitions.

Tesla isn’t the only American company to announce plans for manufacturing in China this week. On June 21, Ford confirmed that it would build its new Focus vehicles in China, not Mexico, to sell for export abroad."

The Tesla Model 3 electric sedan's long-awaited release in July poses a novel question to motorists: Has the time finally come to consider ditching the gas pump in favor of a plug?

Until the Model 3 and General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt electric car, that question was irrelevant to most because there were no long-range, battery-powered vehicles with a price anywhere near the industry's mainstream cars.

Tesla's first electric vehicles were the Model S sedan and Model X crossover, but those ultra-luxury offerings can cost more than $100,000. Let's just say buyers weren't taking the plunge for the sake of saving a few bucks per day on gasoline.

Tesla provides first glimpse of Model 3

Tesla adding 100 service centers, 1,000 technicians as Model 3 goes on sale

But the Model 3 starts at $35,000 before a $7,500 tax credit and travels at least 215 miles on a single battery charge, making the compact sedan a serious option for many American families.

Tesla has released few details about technical specifications, interior design and financing options, and the company declined to comment for this story. But many of the factors to consider are already well known about the Model 3, which will reach a few customers later this month before manufacturing quickly accelerates later this year.

One important factor is lack of availability. If you haven't already placed a refundable $1,000 deposit, it will take at least a year to get the Model 3.

That's because the company received nearly 400,000 refundable deposits, and those people are first in line to buy the car when it's available. The Model S, by contrast, arrives within 30 to 60 days after ordering.

""If you’re in the market for a new car now, can you wait another year or 18 months? You’ve got to give some thought to that,"" said David Bennett, manager of automotive programs and car-buying expert for AAA. ""Anytime you’re buying a car, are you expecting any life changes within the next year, three, five years? And if so, you want to plan ahead thinking of those.""

Here are several key things to keep in mind when deciding whether to place an order.

•You can buy the car online or at a Tesla store. Tesla does not operate traditional car dealerships. Instead, the company sells vehicles directly to consumers. You can customize your car on the website or in the store with help from a Tesla employee.

•There's no haggling. Unlike most traditional dealerships, there's no negotiating on price. It's fixed. But few people will pay only $35,000 because optional features are expected to add costs.

""What I tell people is don’t think $35,000 is all you need to buy the car,"" Kelley Blue Book executive publisher Karl Brauer said. ""That’s the base price. If you want more options it will go up from there.""

CLOSE Tesla shares are lower in Wednesday's trading session after the company's shareholder meeting revealed that not every Tesla car owner will have free access to the company's Superchargers. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook

•Make sure you understand the tax break. Many buyers will qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit on electric cars and possibly state incentives, such as credits available in California.

But it's important to understand that you must still pay the full price up front. The tax benefits come on your next return. Plus, some buyers won't qualify for the full credit if they don't owe the full $7,500 in taxes that year.

•Budget for the insurance and consider gas savings. AAA's Bennett said many new-car buyers forget that their new vehicle will likely be more expensive to insure than their older model.

On the other hand, Model 3 owners are likely to save on fuel costs by switching to electricity, which is typically much less expensive than a tank of gas.

Drivers should consider the ""total cost of ownership over any period of time for any new model,"" Bennett said, including depreciation and maintenance.

What's vexing about the Model 3, however, is that it's so new that no one can predict with certainty how the car will hold up over time. Which leads to the next point.

•Consider your service options . With hundreds of thousands of new Tesla vehicles set to hit the road over the next few years, the automaker is adding 100 new service centers and 350 new mobile vans to provide service where owners are living or working.

But Brauer warned that many Americans live far away from service centers and may not be easily reachable by mobile technicians. For now, the company has no service centers in about half of the states.

""Confirm where you’re going to be in relation to the closest service center,"" Brauer said. ""Having mobile service options and vans isn’t like the panacea to the limited service facilities problem.""

Tesla said earlier this month that its service expansion includes plans to add 1,400 technicians, ""all of which allows us to service more cars at a faster rate and to offer a great customer experience as we prepare for many new Teslas to hit the road.""

•Don't forget you'll have to pay to use Tesla's charging network. Charging up at Tesla's growing network of thousands of supercharging units throughout the country will cost per use.

Most Model S owners can charge for free. Anyone who charges at home will pay the cost of locally generated electricity, which could come from fossil fuel sources.

•Initial quality might be lacking. Tesla has acknowledged missteps in early manufacturing processes, including with the Model X, which the company said ""has been fairly criticized"" for the ""production quality and field reliability.""

With the Model 3, Tesla is ""shortcutting the durability and quality testing"" procedures that typical manufacturers carry out, Brauer said. Instead, the company is conducting digital tests.

With CEO Elon Musk planning a rapid ramp-up to 20,000 units per month by December, Tesla's Fremont, Calif. factory is under intense pressure to quickly iron out any engineering flaws or manufacturing defects.

""There's potential issues there,"" Brauer said.

•It will get you most places on a single charge. The Model 3's battery allows the vehicle to travel about 215 miles, though actual performance varies based on driving patterns and weather.

That's about double the mileage of the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle, which starts at $30,680. It's short of the Chevrolet Bolt's 238 miles.

Just don't forget that unlike a plug-in hybrid vehicle, which uses battery power or gasoline, the Model 3 will run out of juice if the battery is drained. Industry experts call fear of this happening ""range anxiety.""

•The Model S is more luxurious. Apparently concerned that enthusiasts will view the Model 3 as a step up in luxury — much like Apple typically improves the iPhone with each new version — Tesla has taken steps to differentiate the two vehicles.

The Model 3's trunk opens manually, while the Model S gets a powered rear liftgate.

The Model 3 has one 15-inch center touchscreen console, while the Model S gets a 17-inch touchscreen console and a digital instrument panel.

The Model S has a high-efficiency particulate air filtration system, sophisticated suspension design, ""auto-presenting"" door handles, optional 21-inch performance wheels. The Model 3 does not have any of those features.

• Consider alternatives. Right now the Chevy Bolt is the only other similarly priced option with similar range.

The Bolt starts at $37,500 before the tax credit.

After handing over the first 30 sets of keys, Elon Musk will hustle back to the factory, where he hopes to build 20,000 more of the ‘affordable’ electric cars by the end of 2017. Then production really accelerates: Musk has pledged to build 500,000 cars in 2018, more than double the total number of vehicles that Tesla has sold, to date.

Even if Tesla can deliver all those cars, cashing checks is but a tiny part of building an automotive business. Perhaps the bigger challenge for the Silicon Valley outfit is building the infrastructure that will keep its cars charged, and fix them when they break. Giant touchscreens and ludicrous acceleration may attract buyers, but easy ownership will make them come back for more.

Tesla has struggled here: Model S and X owners have already voiced concerns about struggling to get service appointments, waiting months for repairs after crashing, and queueing for supercharger spots at busy times. That's why the automaker announced this week it will triple its service capacity, and has plans to double the size of its Supercharger network.

This work might not be as glamorous as introducing a shiny new model, but having this backbone in place is key to making the Model 3 a success. Tesla want to lure customers from companies like BMW and Toyota, so it has to match the easy, same-day service they're accustomed to.

“If you want to steal buyers from the other brands, you can not expect to offer them a massively different experience,” says R. A. Farrokhnia, Columbia University business and engineering professor. “It has to be more or less the same.”

More Cars, More Service

When it comes to routine repairs, Tesla has a huge advantage over conventional automobiles. Its cars are computers on wheels, always connected over a cell signal or WiFi. Tesla says it can spot and diagnose 90 percent of issues remotely, so it can order needed parts before the customer pulls into the service center.

Today, the company operates just over 150 service centers around the world. It’s adding 100 more, with greater capacity—up to 40 repair lanes in some cases—and 1,400 new technicians to crew them. Electric cars are less complex than those with internal combustion engines, with fewer moving parts and no need for messy tasks like oil changes, which should limit the need for car lifts. Tesla says altogether, it will be able to service cars four times faster than the standard repair shop, using three times less space.

More cleverly, the company is also adding 350 mobile service vans to its fleet, equipped with espresso machines, snacks, and kids activities, to keep customers happy while their car is fixed at home, work, or on the side of the road.

Yes, Tesla has a tendency to make wildly optimistic projections. But in this case, starting from nothing gives it an advantage. Just as it plans to build its cars from first basics, it can design car servicing the same way. Farrokhnia says other car makers wish they could streamline service appointments and introduce new tech, but it’s tougher to get independent dealers to get on board and invest. “Some of this incredibly low hanging fruit is still missing from the broader car dealership experience, but with Tesla having a clean slate, they can do it,” he says.

And because Tesla already has over 350,000 Model 3 reservations, it knows where its customers will be, and can build up service infrastructure exactly where it’s most likely to be needed.

Super Duper Charging

One of the most innovative moves Tesla made from day one was not just building electric cars, but a network of charging stations along freeways to assuage range anxiety and enable long-distance travel. But here, the company is a victim of its own success. Queues are common at the most popular Supercharger sites, so drivers sometimes have to wait half an hour before even starting to charge (which typically takes another 20 to 40 minutes to take on enough electrons to continue on a journey). In November, Tesla stopped automatically offering free charging for life to new customers, to temper demand. The influx of Model 3s will exacerbate this problem.

Tesla is on the case. In April, it announced it would double its network to more than 10,000 chargers globally. Stations are getting bigger too, with more stalls at popular spots—several dozen, versus the current six or eight. Instead of just along highways, chargers will be located in cities for apartment dwellers, without access to home charging.

Investing this kind of work and money before the Model 3 materializes may seem risky, but Tesla has no choice. If it gets it right, by the time Model 3 production is fully up-to-speed, the rest of the company will be too."

The update provides those trying to escape the path of the storm with an additional 30 to 40 miles above the typical range of the vehicle, according to Electrek.

Tesla’s 60 and 60D vehicles offer a range of just above 200 miles on a charge. Faced with an order to leave, one Tesla owner contacted the company, saying that they needed an additional 30 miles of range to get out of the mandatory evacuation zone they were in. In response, the company issued an update to other drivers in the state, providing them with the full 75 kWh capacity of their vehicles through September 16th. One driver posted a screenshot of his app, which showed off the new extended range. A Tesla spokesperson confirmed that the company’s 70kWh vehicles also received the update.

Tesla introduced its cheaper Model X 60D and Model S 60 / 60D vehicles last year. The vehicles are equipped with a 75 KWH battery, but they are software locked to use only 80 percent of that available power. Drivers could unlock that extra capacity with an update for an additional $3,000. Tesla has since discontinued the Model S 60/60D and Model X 60D vehicles, saying that most owners were simply opting for the higher range vehicles.

SAN FRANCISCO — It took Hurricane Irma for some Tesla owners to remember that their electric cars actually had more than range than promised on the showroom floor.

When one Florida owner of a Tesla sold a few years ago contacted his dealer to see if his battery's extra range could be activated remotely, allowing him to get away from the sprawling storm, the company responded by quietly maximizing the range on all the applicable Model S and X vehicles.

While this all sounds like an automotive Great Oz bestowing power magically and selectively on its owners, the truth is simpler.

When Tesla sold cars back in 2016 and early 2017, it offered a cheaper version of its powerful electric vehicles by using software to limit the range of the 75 kilowatt-hour battery to 60 kilowatt-hours, thereby cutting the distance the car could travel by about 30 miles.

This limited-range approach allowed Tesla to build one battery, and gave owners the option of paying as much as $9,500 to unlock full power and extend range to as much as 300 miles. Tesla has discontinued that approach, and today makes 75 kw/hour or 100 kw/hour batteries, with ranges of 265 to 351 miles.

Even today, owners of those previous models can pay that fee to permanently boost the range.

Tesla did not offer a comment on the unpublicized upgrade, but in an email to USA TODAY, a spokesperson said that the boosted cars would have their extra range through Sept. 16.

The electric automaker typically uses over-the-air software updates to improve features and monitor telemetry. But its move to improve battery range caused some to wonder aloud whether Tesla's remotely controlled batteries were a good thing.

""If @Telsa can remotely extend battery range can it b maliciously limited too?"" asked @mattarrow.

Tesla owners seem resigned to the same sort of fingers-crossed relationship that is familiar to anyone living in the permissions-filled internet age.

""To me, it's like when you agree to use cookies, you know (companies) are following you around but you accept it,"" says Larry Chanin, president of the Florida Tesla Enthusiasts club, which has 600 members.

""It's the same with a Tesla,"" he says. ""To maximize use of the car’s capabilities you need to keep them on. Only the most paranoid individuals would see this as a Big Brother kind of situation. I like it, makes me feel good. I just see it as an adjunct to innovation and progress.""

Chanin says he was contacted over the weekend by a member who was shocked that his 60 kw/hour Tesla suddenly seemed to be displaying additional range. ""I had to explain to people what was going on, but they seemed happy,"" he says.

Omar Sultan, president of the NorCal/Reno Tesla Owners Club in the Sacramento, Calif., area says that the stealth nature of the battery boost was surprising. ""No blog post, no tweets from (CEO) Elon (Musk). They just did it,"" he says. ""As for feeling like they're watching over you, it's part and parcel of owning these cars.""

Sultan says Tesla does offer an opt-out option for those who do not want their telemetry data tracked, but he doesn't know of many people to go that route.

""You could say there's certainly potential for abuse, but you either trust the company or you don't,"" he says. ""I've heard some people grumble, saying 'Well what am I getting in return for passing on all this information about my driving,' but the answer is a better car. So it's a trade-off.""

But this act of kindness also highlighted that it had been selling identical cars at different prices

Tesla drivers who fled Hurricane Irma last weekend received an unexpected lesson in modern consumer economics along the way. As they sat on choked highways, some of the electric-car giant’s more keenly priced models suddenly gained an extra 30 or so miles in range thanks to a silent free upgrade.

The move, confirmed by Tesla, followed the request of one Florida driver for a limit on his car’s battery to be lifted. Tesla’s cheaper models, introduced last year, have the same 75KwH battery as its more costly cars, but software limits it to 80% of range. Owners can otherwise buy an upgrade for several thousands of dollars. And because Tesla’s software updates are online, the company can make the changes with the flick of a virtual switch.

It is, points out economist Alex Tabarrok, an example of price discrimination – in this case, the art of selling superficially worse versions of the same or similar product for less. And it is nothing new. “The only thing that has changed is that companies can now change the offering during the life cycle of the product,” says Dr Georg Tacke, a consumer pricing expert and the chief executive of global consultancy Simon Kucher. “As more software gets into our hardware, the more we are going to see this.”

In Damaged Goods, a paper on the subject published by MIT in 1996, economists Raymond Deneckere and Preston McAfee showed how limiting products to make them cheaper can even cost a company more in the short term. In 1990, IBM launched LaserPrinter E, a cheaper version of its LaserPrinter. The only difference? A chip modification that slowed the printing speed to five rather than 10 pages per minute.

But, as Tacke explains, manufacturing two genuinely different versions of a product costs a lot more. The challenge is to predict the willingness to pay of customers while making them feel as if they have benefited from value – or better features. “If you have one product and the price is too high, people don’t buy it. But if it’s too low, you don’t exploit some customers’ willingness to pay,” he says. “So you differentiate and, yes, that means damaging the product in some way.”

This is why there is now also a market for “remapping” modern cars: tweaking their software to unleash hidden performance – like a video game cheat – without touching the engines. Mobile phone and household appliance makers use similar marketing ploys to differentiate products – and sell more overall.

But should we feel cheated by this sleight of hand? “Get used to it,” says Tacke. The key to pulling it off, he adds, is to manage expectations and to do the research to get the prices right. Tesla customers driving the cheaper cars knew what the payoff was. And the company had the last laugh; it no longer offers cheaper cars with the “damaged” battery, because most people bought the upgrade anyway."

The company began producing cars this way to streamline manufacturing; it could produce the same type of battery but provide different price points, charging customers up to $9,500 for an upgrade to full capacity.

Tesla has since stopped offering the software-limited batteries.

A spokeswoman for Tesla declined to comment, and did not specify how many Tesla owners had benefited from the upgrade.

For Chris Forman, a pilot, the $6,000 discount for a 60-kilowatt-hour battery instead of a 75-kilowatt-hour version was enough to persuade him to spend roughly $70,000 on his Model S in November.

“I never thought I was paying for a car that was neutered — I was paying less to get less range,” he said.

Mr. Forman, who lives in Broward County, Fla., had flown to St. Louis for work on Friday when he checked his Tesla app and saw that his car, plugged in at home, had reached 242 miles of range and was still charging. He had never seen the vehicle exceed 215 miles.

He said he was impressed with Tesla’s initiative, especially given that the company is in the process this month of ramping up production of its Model 3 mass-market vehicle.

“I was totally blown away. It was super awesome of them to do that,” Mr. Forman said of the software upgrade. “Tesla is always thinking outside the box.”"

Now, we're back with a list of the coolest features that drivers will find when they get behind the wheel of a Tesla Model S. The car is absolutely jam-packed with technology, from cameras flanking every angle to a built-in sketchpad for bored passengers. There are dozens of hidden quirks and fun toys to choose from, but we've selected 11 favorites from our time with the Tesla Model S. Listed out from most important to least, here they are:

1. Autopilot

Autopilot is Tesla's advanced suite of active driver assistance. The system is capable of controlling the throttle, brakes and steering in certain situations. It can even make lane changes if the driver activates the vehicle's turn signal. For a more in-depth look at Autopilot, see the full review here.

2. Ludicrous Plus mode

Ludicrous Plus mode on the Tesla Model S Mack Hogan | CNBC

To unlock the full potential of the Tesla's drivetrain, drivers have to put the vehicle into Ludicrous mode. This, of course, is a reference to the satirical film ""Space Balls,"" in which the spaceship's speedometer has four options: Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed and Plaid. The newest update, though, features Ludicrous Plus mode. It can be activated by holding down the Ludicrous option in the settings menu for 5 seconds; this will trigger the hyperspace animation shown above. Users are then told that Ludicrous Plus will accelerate wear on the motor, gearbox and battery. Asked if they want to continue, the driver gets two options: ""No, I want my Mommy"" or ""Yes, bring it on."" Opt for yes, and you've now unlocked the ability to go from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in a dizzying 2.4 seconds, officially. Third parties, though, have recorded times as low as 2.24 seconds.

3. Superchargers

No gasoline here Mack Hogan | CNBC

Superchargers are Tesla's network of fast chargers. Right now, they're the only widely available fast chargers in the United States. Because they allow users to recharge hundreds of miles of range in only an hour, they're the best way for electric vehicles to conquer road trips. At present, they only work with Tesla vehicles. That means if you want an electric vehicle that can take you from coast to coast without bumming electricity off houses and businesses, Tesla's the only game in town.

4. Over-the-air updates

The Model S was the first car to offer software upgrades via over-the-air updates. Just like your phone, the Model S downloads new software over time that irons out bugs and introduces new capabilities. Autopilot updates, Ludicrous Plus mode and dozens of other improvements have been added to the Model S, and are sent out to all owners with compatible vehicles. Tesla will even sell you a car with an array of cameras designed to enable full self-driving capability through a future software update.

5. Streaming services

Streaming radio options on the Model S Mack Hogan | CNBC

Because the car is internet-connected to provide software updates, Tesla was also able to bundle in audio-streaming services such as Slacker and TuneIn. Slacker allows you to create radio stations and personalize them by thumbing songs up or down. It works like Pandora, but there were no ads, and I never hit a skip limit. TuneIn allows you to connect to live radio stations from across the country. If you're in Columbus but want to listen to your favorite Bay Area DJs, you can do that. TuneIn also offers podcasts, and as you can see I was listening to a particularly relevant episode of Radiolab during my time evaluating Autopilot.

6. Web browser

Tesla's web browser is cool but slow Mack Hogan | CNBC

The internet connection also enables a built-in web browser. For safety reasons, you can't watch videos on the screen, but everything else is fair game. One thing I should note: While it's a unique and cool feature, the web browser was the least polished part of the Tesla's software. Web pages took ages to load, and scrolling was often slow and jittery. Images, too, sometimes failed to load. It's a work in progress.

7. Auto-raising suspension

Automatic suspension on the Model S Mack Hogan | CNBC

Many luxury or off-road vehicles now come equipped with air suspension, which allows the car to adjust the firmness of the ride to better suit driving conditions. For sporty driving, you may want firmer suspension. On the highway, you want it nice and soft. Another advantage is that air suspension allows users to adjust the ride height of the car. On the highway you may want the car to hunker down for aerodynamics, but you'll need to raise it to clear speed bumps when you get to the destination. The Model S, though, takes some of the thinking out of it. You can set the car to automatically lower at high speed then rise back up as you exit the highway. If you manually raise it at a certain point, the car will remember that spot and automatically raise the next time you go over the same area. Pretty smart stuff.

8. Advanced parking sensors

I love the Model S parking sensors Mack Hogan | CNBC

Parking sensors have been around for decades. That's nothing new. But Tesla does them better. In my tired old Lincoln, the parking sensors start beeping when they detect a squirrel six counties over from the left side of your bumper. They're full on blaring when you're three car lengths away from a parked car and have gone into a solid monotone wail when you could still lie down between your car and the other vehicle. Tesla handles it differently. Instead of just different levels of screaming, the Tesla shows you where the object is being detected and how far away it is. No, not only in terms of ambiguous red and yellow lines, but in inches. It's the first car where the parking sensors aren't massively annoying.

9. The key

Tesla's awesome key fob Mack Hogan | CNBC

The key is shaped like the car. Isn't that cute? If that isn't enough, it's also a pretty clever key. With no visible buttons, it can still do more than the average fob you have on your car. Just by pushing different parts of the little car, you can open the front trunk (frunk), unlock the car, lock the car or open the trunk. Chain together a double tap and hold of the roof with a tap to the front or back and you'll activate Summon. Depending on whether you hit the front or back of the key, the car will pull itself out of a parking spot without you even being inside. It'll pull out up to a set distance or until it detects something in the way.

10. The app

The Tesla app is full-featured Mack Hogan | CNBC

If you don't want to use the key to activate Summon, you're welcome to use the app. The app will also unlock or lock the car, flash the lights or trigger the horn. Your phone can even show you where the car is and what its charge level is. Finally, the app allows you to set the climate control of the car no matter where you are. When I was sitting in my apartment getting ready to leave, I'd activate the climate control so by the time I walked to my garage — far outside the reach of a normal keyfob for remote start — the car was nice and toasty.

11. Easter eggs

The Tesla Rainbow Road Easter egg Mack Hogan | CNBC

Finally, the Model S is packed with hidden features that are fun to mess around with. There's a drawing pad so you can practice your artistry from the comfort of the car. Tap the red planet and your GPS will show the vehicle as a rover on Mars, a nod to Elon Musk's other company, SpaceX. Then there's my favorite, the one shown above. Hit the hidden cowbell, and you'll be prompted to pull the Autopilot stalk four times. Do that, and the audio of the ""More Cowbell"" skit from Saturday Night Live will start to play and the Autopilot display will show you on Rainbow Road."

DETROIT — Electric car maker Tesla is expanding its service operations and hiring more than 1,000 technicians to meet expected demand for its new Model 3 sedan.

The Model 3, cheaper than Tesla's existing cars, goes on sale this month and is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of new customers to the brand.

To accommodate them, the company is adding 100 new service centers worldwide over the next year, bringing its total number of service centers to 250. The new service centers will be in areas that have the most reservation-holders for the Model 3.

Tesla also is adding 350 vans to its mobile service fleet, mostly in the U.S. The vans go to owners' homes or offices and repair their cars while they wait, typically for about one hour. The vans are equipped with tools and replacement parts as well as an espresso machine, snacks and kids' toys.

Until now, Tesla had around 30 mobile repair vans, which were used mostly in cases where the owner lived too far from a service center. About six months ago, the company began deploying the vans in the San Francisco area in order to ease the burden on its service centers and see if they could help meet anticipated demand for the Model 3. Customers were happy with the new arrangement, so the company decided to roll out mobile service in more locations.

At a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is about half the cost of Tesla's two other models. Tesla hasn't said how many people hold refundable, $1,000 reservations for the car, but it has said it expects to make 500,000 vehicles in 2018. That's up from 84,000 last year.

RELATED:

Like its stores, which are owned by the company and not by franchised dealers, Tesla has upended the auto industry with its service model. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said several years ago that unlike traditional dealerships, Tesla didn't intend to make a profit on service and repairs. U.S. dealers made $110 billion in service and parts sales last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.

Tesla said it's charging the same amount for non-warranty repairs done at service centers or through mobile vans. It hasn't released details on the warranty plan for the Model 3, so it's not yet clear if it will match Tesla's other vehicles. The Model S and Model X have a four-year, 50,000-mile vehicle warranty and an eight-year battery warranty with unlimited miles.

Unlike traditional dealers, Tesla also doesn't want customers to have to go to a service center for repairs that can be done remotely. The company says 80 percent of repairs to its cars, including replacing the tires or fixing electronic glitches, can be done without a lift, which means it's just as easy to perform them out of a mobile repair van. That leaves service centers free to concentrate on more complicated repairs that require a lift, like motor or battery problems.

Tesla is hiring 1,400 new service technicians this year to staff the service centers and mobile repair vans.

Quite frankly, I was wondering how long it would take until this happened. I should know: I'm signed up for the Tesla Model 3 and have no intention of actually buying it.

My relationship with Tesla didn't begin on what I'd describe as a positive note. Back in 2013, I was hired to direct a commercial for a beautiful cottage community being built in Point Roberts, Washington. The developer wanted to include a Tesla in the ad, so I found a Model S through a university friend whose brother had just purchased one.

Yes, the car was exquisite on the outside; my crew and I marveled at the look. But none of us were very impressed with what we found on the inside. The leather seats seemed to have a cardboard feel to them, and the trim levels weren't anything close to what you'd expect for a car with a price tag hovering around $90,000 USD.

But it was the battery that really turned me off. We were driving it a fair bit throughout the day, in a manner that would've used up roughly half a tank of gas in a comparable internal combustion-powered vehicle. By the end of the shoot, we were literally crossing our fingers, hoping the car would make it to the charging station so it could drive home. If not, all of us realized we'd have an expensive and useless brick on our hands.

Luckily, it made it. But what followed was a 45-minute wait for the car to have enough of a charge for the relatively short commute back to its owner.

So, my initial impression? Great-looking car on the outside, iffy on the inside, huge battery issues, and an unrealistic price tag. Tesla was an experimental car for wealthy techies.

Fast-forward to March 2016. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the Model 3 as, ""a mass market, affordable car."" The press declared it as ""sexy and fast."" And I decided to take a second look.

With a workable price point of $35,000 USD and a decent range of over 200 miles, maybe this could work for my family of 5? I've always hated paying for gas, and trucking kids around to sporting events all over earth's creation had proven the point: I needed to find a cheaper transportation alternative.

The more I looked into it, the more I liked it. The price was really what sold me. So, a month after the Model 3 was announced, on March 30, 2016, I visited the Tesla website, paid my $1,000 deposit, and was officially in line.

The disillusionment began almost right away.

After visiting ""Model 3 Counter"" and being told my estimated spot in line was 410,862 with an estimated delivery date of June 2020, I began to question my sanity. Those figures would be later updated to the 203,535 th place in line and a delivery date of May 2018—but the damage was done. I would never wait for anything that long, especially after laying down $1,000. If my wife had told me I'd have to wait two-and-a-half years after proposing to her, I think I would've ditched her. So, why should a car be any different?

My serious questions began in the fall of 2016 when Mercedes announced the Mercedes EQ, the German carmaker's electric SUV concept vehicle. The company said it would have a range up to 310 miles, a price point of around $40,000 USD, and cars rolling off the assembling line in 2019.

I owned a 1992 Mercedes 500SL AMG when I was younger. It was the most incredible car ever—so I could only imagine how solid the EQ would be.

The Mercedes EQ, coupled with the rave reviews and relatively inexpensive price tags of the Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Bolt, began to change my opinion about waiting for the Model 3.

But it was when I took a look at the market data for Tesla Motors that I changed my mind completely.

Up until a few days ago, Tesla was the most valuable carmaker in America with a higher market capitalization than the Big 3: Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler! For a company that churned out a measly 47,000 cars in the first half of 2017, something doesn't add up. By comparison, Ford sold over 234,000 vehicles in March 2017 ALONE!

Yes, based on the paid registrations ( 400,000 according to Forbes), so far the Model 3 has been an incredible success. But for people like me—cost-conscious consumers looking for real value—the Model 3 likely won't deliver. As more and more automakers make electric vehicles, I keep coming back to the same question: How is Tesla going to compete? When the Model 3 was announced, Tesla was the only legitimate EV manufacturer in the world. Now they're up against everybody: Mercedes, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, etc.

I'm not interested in gambling money on what ultimately turns out to be another DeLorean.

Yes, I'm signed up for the Model 3. But when it comes time to actually purchase it, I'll be taking my $1,000 deposit back and heading to a Mercedes showroom. I bet I won't be the only one."

In December, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, most car companies used their display space to show off new models and concept cars. Tesla (tsla), the idiosyncratic electric-vehicle maker—which more often than not passes on these industry events—brought a house.

Dubbed the House of the Future, it was outfitted with Tesla-brand solar panels and one of Tesla’s home battery storage units, the Powerwall. Tesla’s fleet of highly sought-after vehicles—consisting of the Model X, Model S, and the recently released Model 3—was there too, of course. The cars and the homes of the future are each components of the state-of-the-art, cleaner-energy ecosystem that Tesla is defining and designing for us all.

There’s an obvious metaphor in that. Few, if any, companies think as big as Tesla: To say the 15-year-old company is merely reinventing the automobile industry would be selling it short. And few, if any, have had as swift and profound an impact on the way we conceive of an object, as mythic and everyday, as the car. “They’re bringing the Internet of things to the automobile, or vice versa—the automobile to the Internet of things,” says Mark Baskinger, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Design. “That’s really interesting as they’re positioning themselves as a different paradigm.”

Wall Street has clearly bought into the vision. As of mid-December, Tesla’s share price was up 61% in 2017, pushing its market value to $58 billion—on par with GM (gm) and above that of Ford (f).

Playing the role of visionary is Tesla cofounder and CEO Elon Musk. But while some snicker at his grand ideas—let’s go colonize Mars!—the accomplishments of his car company are hard to deny.

See the full Business by Design list here.

From Tesla’s push toward automation and self-driving capabilities to its treatment of car as software (with system updates beamed out over the air) to simply making electric vehicles cool, the traces of Tesla’s new paradigm are increasingly visible in the way more traditional automakers are designing and engineering their cars.

Tim Huntzinger, an automotive designer who teaches in the renowned transportation program at the ArtCenter College of Design, says perhaps Tesla’s biggest influence will be on the well-worn model of how cars are made and sold. “They managed to sell so many Model 3s, even before the Model 3 was in its final design stages,” says Huntzinger, marveling at the feat. “It was almost like they were doing Kickstarter for cars. They were able to bring in hundreds of millions in revenue before actually creating final tooling for the vehicle.”

It’s been an almost unprecedented success. Says Huntzinger, “That’s huge for the automotive industry. For the entire history of the automotive industry, you had to spend millions or hundreds of millions to even turn a cent. Many companies have gone out of business that way.”

Huntzinger, who compares Tesla’s ethos to Apple’s, adds that the elevated role of the consumer in that process is also transformative. “To get feedback from customers early in the process—that’s totally new and totally different.”

There’s also the radical approach Tesla has taken with the car-buying experience—to make it pleasurable, by placing its stores in malls and letting people order their cars online. “The purchasing experience is so different [from what] we’ve all been forced into with the dealership model,” says Huntzinger. “It’s super-refreshing to see the customer being put first.”

Later this evening, Musk will host an exclusive handover party for 30 customers who reserved the Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market electric car. They will be the first people in the world (not named Musk) to receive what is widely seen as one of the most important electric cars of our time.

For Tesla, it’s all been leading to the Model 3. If you believe the hype, this is the car that will rescue us from the evil clutches of the internal combustion engine — and for just $35,000. So the pressure is on Tesla to finally deliver on its promise of bringing clean, sustainable driving to the masses.

it’s all been leading to the Model 3

“The Model 3 is far more than just another car,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at AutoTrader. “If successful, it would mark a breakthrough for electric vehicles and would be promising in terms of the proliferation of the technology. However, the challenges are formidable.”

For the hundreds of thousands of people who plunked down a $1,000 deposit to reserve a Model 3, today is a moment of both angst and elation. After all, they’re not guaranteed a car until they’ve had the chance to access the online design studio and configure the vehicle to place an order. And Tesla’s employees, who reportedly made 10,000 of the estimated 500,000 reservations, are being given priority. Which means very few non-Tesla-employed people will be driving this car until at least next year.

Still, many have drunk Musk’s Kool-Aid, believing themselves to be on the road to environmental and technological righteousness. But they also openly question whether Tesla will be able to deliver the Model 3 as promised, echoing the skepticism from Wall Street about the company’s ability to meet its production goals. Tesla has failed to meet dozens of projections over the years, to the point where blown deadlines have become a hallmark of Musk’s tenure.

The first production Model 3 rolled off the assembly line at Tesla’s Fremont factory earlier this month. Musk has said production is expected to grow exponentially: 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 by September, and then 20,000 per month by December.

Musk is expected to host a handover party for the first 30 customers

We know what the Model 3 means for Tesla. This is a make-or-break moment for the buzz-worthy electric carmaker that has seen its valuation soar, thanks to the stalwart belief by investors that Musk has his fingers on the digital pulse of the future. Moreover, experts agree this is one of the most important — if not the most important — electric car ever released.

But when speaking to would-be buyers of the Model 3, a more aspirational narrative emerges. Some just want the facts: how much is it going to cost, when will the configurator launch, what version of Autopilot will they get, etc. But other reservation-holders say the Model 3 represents the future, a cleaner, more sustainable way to travel. And ironically, buying this car gestures toward a future where personal car ownership, and driving itself, is entirely obsolete.

We interviewed a handful of Model 3 reservation holders. Here’s what they told us:

“I really believe in electric vehicles”

August Bigelow, a 33-year-old software developer, first bought his 2010 Volkswagen Jetta TDI believing he was doing his part to improve the air quality in his central Utah town. So he was understandably dismayed when he learned in 2015 that VW had installed illegal software in millions of diesel vehicles, including his own, to deceive regulators about NOx emissions.

“While it’s an excellent drive, I am reminded every day of the pollution it’s expelling,” Bigelow said. “I bought that Jetta because I was told — lied to — that it was a clean and good car.”

Now he can’t wait to turn in the Jetta and use the buyback money from VW to buy a new car. “I wanted a Model 3 because I really believe in electric vehicles,” he said. “My hope with the Model 3 is that it's finally an electric car that is performant, with enough range for the majority of my use, and ends up pushing the automotive industry forward.”

“It’s my dream car”

Neeraj Periwal, 25, a content marketing manager for Cisco Meraki in San Francisco, said it’s “nerve-wracking” to put down $1,000 for a car, and then not receive any updates about the status of his order. “But then again, for most people — including myself — who put down a reservation, $1,000 isn't enough to break the bank.”

Though he’s never owned a Tesla, he’s always been a fan of the electric carmaker. “I want a car that clearly represents a break from the past,” Periwal said. To him, car ownership is headed toward extinction, thanks to innovations like app-based ride-hailing and autonomy. He sees the Model 3 as an investment in that future.

“If possible, I would love to continue living without a car until autonomous, on-demand cars become a reality, at which point I'd be able to pay a small monthly fee to have unlimited transportation wherever I need to go,” Periwal said. “The Model 3 is a new type of car. It's modern, yet affordable. It's my dream car — though whether I want a car at this point in my life is still up for debate.”

“It’s the future of cars”

Don Drake, 46, an independent technology consultant living in Arlington Heights, Illinois, doesn’t expect to receive his Model 3 for at least another year — and probably longer. “Before the end of 2017? Haha, no way,” Drake said. “Before the end of 2018? I sure hope so.” He was disappointed when he read he’d likely to have to wait even longer for an all-wheel-drive version of the Model 3. But living in the snowy suburbs of Chicago doesn’t leave him with a lot of options.

Drake has always wanted a Model S, but couldn’t justify the expense of Tesla’s luxury sedan. “I want one because it’s the future of cars and autonomous driving is the future of transportation,” he said. “The technology is amazing.”

He vowed that he would never buy another American car after problems with two previous US-made vehicles. “I’m breaking that vow with this order, and it still makes me a little nervous,” Drake said. “I’m hoping that this car lives up to the hype and will work, be fun to drive and be as safe as it’s advertised. I’m also hoping it doesn’t break the bank, but I know from experience that cars starting at $35,000 can get to $60,000 pretty fast with fancy upgrades.”

“My biggest hopes for this car”

Jordan Hart, a real estate consultant from Dayton, Ohio, was first in line outside the Cincinnati Tesla store back in March 2016, ready to hand over his $1,000 deposit for the Model 3 sight-unseen. But unlike other reservation holders, Hart says he’s confident he’ll receive his car before the end of the year. That’s because someone figured out that by looking at the HTML code of Tesla’s Model 3 reservation page, you could find your place in line.

Tesla has since hidden that from public view, but Hart took a screenshot. “I'm in the top 30,000 globally,” he boasted.

Hart’s not your typical Tesla fan. Earlier this month, he and a friend set the record for fastest transcontinental drive in an electric car: a “cannonball run” from California to New York in a Tesla Model S in 51 hours and 47 minutes. That said, Hart has a very specific wish list for the Model 3, especially as it relates to Tesla’s trend-setting semi-autonomous features.

“My biggest hopes for this car are that Autopilot will advance enough to allow fully self-driving from on-ramp to off-ramp on highways... and that it will be able to pick me up and drop me off at restaurants [and] stores before it goes and finds a parking spot on it's own,” he said. “I'm also hoping there is some exciting new tech on the interior that Elon has kept secret.”

Tesla has yet to offer a clear look at the interior of the Model 3. The quick glimpses and spy shots we’ve seen so far indicate the car lacks an instrument panel, trading the traditional cluster of controls for a single, 15-inch touchscreen display. It could end up turning off a lot of potential customers, but Tesla is betting heavily that self-driving cars are the future of transportation. “The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need,” Musk tweeted recently. “How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?”

“My first ever ‘new’ car purchase”

Dan Mitchell drove his grandmother’s old Ford Taurus all through high school and college. His next car was a used 2009 Kia Rio, which he used to criss-cross the country while doing political work. He continued driving the Rio through business school and up until last year, when he reserved a Model 3. “My Kia didn't even have power windows or locks,” Mitchell said, “so the Model 3 would be a huge upgrade.”

Mitchell, 31, put down a deposit while in business school at UCLA, thinking he was going to stay in California, however, he recently moved to Boston to work at a start-up and now relies mostly on public transit and ridesharing apps. “Like many other millennials I really like not having to worry about parking [and] driving and can get more done on my commute,” he said.

That said, he’s excited about the change he believes the Model 3 represents. “My hope is this car could be a step forward for the entire automotive industry, toward a future of every car being electric, self-driving, and shared,” he said. “Progress is going to take time, however by being an early adopter, maybe I can do my part and help speed it up, just a little.”

Mitchell is doing more than most to speed up that progress: “I put down two deposits, the other was for my mom, who lives in the Bay Area and is still very excited about getting the car.”

“The ultimate gadget”

For Tyler Hayes, a 33-year-old communications manager from San Diego, the allure of the Model 3 are twofold: “I've wanted a Tesla since the Model S debuted, for all the reasons most people want a Tesla vehicle, including the speed, no gas consumption, and attractiveness. But I also see Tesla cars as the ultimate gadgets, full of rad technology and a way to get rid of all the unnecessary hassles of a combustion engine.”

Wall Street has set low expectations for the ability of Tesla to meet its production and delivery goals. Morgan Stanley predicts only 2,000 Model 3s will ship this year, while Goldman Sachs assumes 2,205 vehicles will be delivered. Still, Hayes is hopeful he’ll get his Model 3 sometime next year. If spring comes and goes without a delivery, he says he’ll start getting nervous.

While Hayes and other reservation holders wait, Tesla’s expanding fan base fills its online message board and subreddits with speculation and predictions. Sites like Tesla Motor Club and Teslarati contain posts parsing every Musk quote and every snippet of code for clues about this hotly anticipated vehicle. Wading through all this content, one loses perspective on the Model 3. It becomes less of a car and more of a catalyst — but for what? Hayes says he’s trying to stay grounded.

“I know the Model 3 seems largely a mystery, or there's enough information missing that people's imaginations are filling in the gaps and making this a magical car, but my hopes for it are mostly simple,” he said. “My hope is that if the Model 3 turns out to be a dependable, fast, and attractive car like it appears it will be, then I'll be satisfied with it.”"
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608331/teslas-model-3-is-a-long-way-from-elon-musks-grand-goal/,pos,1.0,2.723087888032805e-28,Tesla’s Model 3 Is a Long Way from Elon Musk’s Grand Goal,2017-07-28 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:18:36.857018,James Temple,"Eleven years ago, Elon Musk laid out a grandiose, three-point plan for a niche electric car startup known as Tesla Motors. The company would deliver three vehicles at successively lower prices, funneling cash from sales of its sports car and luxury sedan back into research and development, driving down costs and speeding up the timeline for the ultimate goal: an all-electric, low-cost family car.

Only once clean vehicles reached the mass market could the company achieve what Musk saw as Tesla's overarching purpose: expediting the shift from ""a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy"" (see “Elon Musk’s House of Gigacards”).

On Friday, against all reasonable expectations a decade ago, the company will arrive at the final step of that initial plan. During a carefully staged event at its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Tesla will deliver the first of its long-awaited Model 3s to several dozen early customers. The four-door sedan starts at $35,000 before incentives, with a range of 215 miles per charge.

You can quibble over whether that's genuinely affordable (auto observers would generally call it “entry-level luxury”). But there's little doubt the vehicle will lure a wider mix of customers to electric vehicles—and no dispute that Tesla has already reshaped the automobile market. The company helped make plug-in vehicles appealing in a nation infatuated with brawny, gas-guzzling cars and trucks, forcing other manufacturers to initiate or accelerate their own EV plans.

But arriving at step three, of course, is very far from fulfilling Musk’s grander vision. For all the rapid recent growth, electric vehicles are still a tiny market, representing less than 1 percent of new sales globally.

Electric vehicles will almost certainly grab a swelling portion of the auto market in the years ahead. But it will be a long time before they tip into the truly mainstream, and longer still before they could meaningfully reduce the sector’s dependence on those hydrocarbons.

Many things still need to change in underlying infrastructure, consumer appetites, public policies, and battery prices before any of this can happen. And there is wide disagreement about how fast that’s likely to unfold, and where Tesla will stand once it does (see “Tesla’s Next Broken Promise”).

Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiling the company's home battery in 2015.

A bevy of batteries

As ever, count Musk as the optimist on these scores.

Earlier this month, during an onstage interview at the 2017 National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island, he predicted that more than half of all new cars produced in the United States will be electric “probably in 10 years.” That’s more than a decade ahead of most optimistic estimates.

To put Musk’s forecast into context, half of U.S. demand in 2027 would add up to 9.1 million electric vehicles, based on Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates. If those all ran on 60 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery packs—reportedly the standard package for the Model 3—it would require enough manufacturing capacity to produce 546 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery packs annually. And that's just for the United States market.

To put that into context, worldwide EV battery production stands at only 90 gigawatt-hour today, and there's only 270 gigawatt-hours in the planning or construction phases, according to BNEF.

Initially, Tesla said its massive “gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada, would produce 50 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery packs per year, but more recently raised its projection for final capacity to 150 gigawatt-hours. That means achieving Musk’s goal would require companies to plan and build four to 16 additional gigafactory-scale operations just for U.S. car production, all within the next decade (see “Does Musk’s Gigafactory Make Sense?”). Tesla's first factory is expected to be fully operational in 2020, meaning it took six years to complete from the time it was announced. The company's second gigafactory is primarily dedicated to producing solar panels, but the company said that three more factory sites could be disclosed by the end of this year, presumably devoted to batteries. Attempting to add anywhere near that level of manufacturing capacity will, of course, further extend a company already carrying a hefty debt load—an issue that could pose real risks should Tesla encounter unexpected headwinds (see “Tesla’s Money Problems Are No Surprise”).

The company didn't respond to an inquiry from MIT Technology Review.

Colin McKerracher, head of transport analysis at BNEF, expects U.S. demand for electric vehicles to reach only 3.2 million by 2027, less than 18 percent of the total, though he does say a successful Model 3 launch could accelerate adoption. According to his models, it'll take another decade to cross Musk’s halfway threshold, reaching 54 percent on a global basis in 2040.

Consumer tastes

Anything approaching 50 percent penetration, whether in 10 years or 23, will require radical shifts in consumer preferences.

U.S. auto sales reached a record high in 2016. But trucks and SUVs led the way once again, accounting for 63 percent of transactions, driven in part by low gas prices. None of that suggests that a giant portion of American consumers are clamoring for plug-in cars, which still entail some clear disadvantages.

""They're more expensive, they don't drive as far, and it takes time to recharge,"" says Jeremy Michalek, director of the Vehicle Electrification Group at Carnegie Mellon University. “You have enthusiasts, but for mainstream consumers it's still just an inferior product.""

Of course, there’s still only a handful of electric vehicle models available in the U.S., including Tesla’s high-end Model S and Model X, the Ford Focus Electric, and the recently released $36,496 Chevy Bolt, which managed to beat Musk to the quasi-entry-level market segment. But a growing number of manufacturers are going after the space, with some two dozen models debuting at last fall’s Paris Motor Show. Volvo recently announced all of its vehicles will have an electric motor by 2019 (which includes “mild hybrids”), and it will launch five new all-electric models by 2021.

If the Model 3 is a hit, it may well grab market share from other internal combustion engine cars around the same price point, and encourage more manufacturers to bulk up their EV offerings, McKerracher says.

Still, BNEF predicts that mass-market adoption will occur in most markets only once electric cars reach price parity with internal combustion engines. That’s not likely to happen on an unsubsidized basis until 2025, at which point the research group expects lithium-ion batteries to have reached $109 per kilowatt hour, down from $273 last year.

But not everyone agrees battery prices—and by extension, EV costs—will fall that fast. Michalek’s research found that most of the big price declines from manufacturing EV batteries at larger scales have already occurred. Any additional steep declines will require technological innovations, which are harder to accurately forecast, he says.

The other force that could drive down costs, and accelerate adoption, would be more supportive public policies. Some U.S. states are pushing hard, including California, where legislators recently proposed adding another $3 billion in subsidies on top of already sizable state EV tax credits. But any additional federal policies pushing adoption aren’t likely to pass under the current administration and Congress.

Another critical challenge surrounding electric vehicles is charging infrastructure. Widening the market beyond the well-to-do means attracting apartment dwellers as well as homeowners. They don’t necessarily have their own parking lots or garages—or a strong desire to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars installing charging capacity on someone else’s property.

Tesla's Gigafactory, near Sparks, Nevada, began producing lithium-ion batteries in January.

Public policies and resources could help accelerate the necessary changes on this front as well. Various nations, states, and cities are already trying assorted approaches, including requiring new construction to include charging capacity, or adding publicly funded curbside charging.

An accommodating grid

Researchers generally believe existing U.S. energy generation can accommodate a vast number of electric cars. A 2007 study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that without adding a new plant or transmission line, the U.S. grid could reliably charge 84 percent of the nation’s cars, pickups, and SUVs.

That continues to hold true, but does require managing the grid in more efficient ways, says Michael Kintner-Meyer, a co-author of that study. Notably, utilities will need to employ price incentives or technological tools to ensure EV owners are charging their battery packs during the night—rather than, say, all at once after work.

That load balancing, however, raises an interesting issue: In much of the country, the cheap, flexible power sources at night are often coal-fired power plants. That means you could actually end up with higher greenhouse emissions from a particularly dirty energy source, Carnegie Mellon’s Michalek notes.

And that gets us to the fundamental challenge facing Musk’s larger vision of using electric vehicles to green the transportation sector. Cars and trucks that don’t burn fossil fuels—whether they run on lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, or some other technology—will be a necessary condition for achieving that goal. But they’re nowhere close to a sufficient one.

The vehicles will only be as clean as the power sources used to charge them, and more than 80 percent of U.S. energy generation still comes from fossil fuels.

“In the long term, these technologies may be the only way we're able to reach these targets,” Michalek says. “But whether we actually reach them or not depends on what we do with the rest of the electricity system.”"
https://qz.com/1040213/teslas-biggest-competition-for-the-model-3-will-not-come-from-other-electric-vehicles/,pos,1.0,5.693290129447639e-20,Tesla’s biggest competition for the Model 3 will not come from other electric vehicles,2017-07-28 11:00:03,2019-06-24 14:18:38.170405,,"Tesla says more than 1 million people will be buying its electric cars annually by 2020, many of them the Model 3 arriving on July 28. Given today’s electric vehicle (EV) market, that destination is still a long way off.

Though it gets talked up a lot, the EV market has yet to launch. Sales of electric cars represent just 1% of the record 17.55 million cars sold last year in the US. GM’s electric flagship, the Chevy Bolt, hasn’t seen spectacular sales despite sunny reviews (GM announced it was pausing factory production this summer to help clear inventory off its lots). Other models aren’t exactly driving themselves off the lot either.

Despite this, Tesla is undeniably on top. The company’s Model S sedans and Model X SUVs accounted for more than half of the EV market in the US in 2016, more than the next 12 models combined. Tesla itself is one of the world’s most valuable carmakers just 14 years after its founding as a Silicon Valley startup.

This might seem like unalloyed good news for Tesla, but it’s not. For CEO Elon Musk, the competition isn’t other EVs; it’s gasoline engines. Tesla needs to take on the conventional car market to survive, and it needs buyers to defect en masse from fossil fuels. That’s not happening, yet.

The launch of the Model 3, the company’s first mass-market electric vehicle, on July 28 will mark the beginning (or perhaps the end) of Musk’s quest to deliver an affordable, superior EV to the world’s driveways and highways. The $35,000 electric vehicle (before incentives) has stirred up a frenzy of interest since Tesla announced it in 2014, and more than 375,000 people forked over a $1,000 deposit to get on a waiting list for the car.

Tesla must find a way to sell cars to drivers who still view electric vehicles with suspicion or indifference, or it will falter under the burden of its costly (and mostly profit-less) expansion. Until recently, Musk had the breeze at his back. The company’s stock price soared (too much, Musk has asserted), and production numbers were back on track after some bumpy years. But in July, manufacturing delays arose. Skittish investors started to sell, and Tesla’s market cap, once eclipsing every other carmaker, was sent back to second place, just behind GM. Its stock shed more than $10 billion in market value over two weeks from a June 23 peak of $63 billion. Now, with all eyes on the Model 3, critics say Tesla may stall out.

“Elon Musk likes making history, which is good because he’ll have to accomplish several unprecedented feats to pull off a successful Model 3 launch,” wrote Karl Brauer, publisher at Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader. He cited a production increase never achieved by any automaker before (400,000 Model 3s in 2018 from only about 35,000 in 2017), a relatively small number of dealers and service centers, and less durability testing than all previous high-volume vehicle.

Once the Model 3 clears these hurdles, it must then find at least as many people willing to buy its car ever year that it now has in its entire backlog. ”This is very unlikely in the US market anytime soon,” warns Sam Abuelsamid of the consulting firm Navigant. With the car market showing signs of softening, analysts predict US car sales will plateau over the next decade, perhaps even declining by about 15%, potentially dragging down EVs with it. Tesla, with only three models, must expand its stable at the same time it’s ramping production and fighting market headwinds.

But advocates say EV market growth will defy the larger market trends. EV sales spiked 40% last year over 2015, picking up from a 32% annual growth rate over the last five years. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates if the trend continues, 10% of all US cars will be fully electric by 2025. To do this, carmakers will have to sell and market their EVs just like they do their conventional models—something that has not generally been done. Until now, EVs have largely been compliance cars: vehicles sold and marketed (half-heartedly) by big automakers primarily to meet fleet emission regulations in the US and abroad.

That’s changing as more than a dozen new EV models are set to debut by 2020, competing head to head with conventional cars on style and performance. Rebecca Lindland, an automotive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, says Tesla has a clear advantage: people buy Teslas because of the brand, not because they are EVs.

“People have an emotional response to Tesla, but not necessarily to Leaf, Bolt, and other models” said Lindland in an interview (she has a deposit on a Model 3). “People are buying into [Musk’s] mission. On some level, it’s to save the world, and he has a product to back it up as well.”

That’s helped by the fact that Tesla is far and away the most visible EV brand. Analytics and data visualization firm Quid examined 3,142 US news articles on electric vehicles in 2017. It found that Tesla was mentioned in coverage across almost every major EV topic, and appeared in about twice the number articles compared to its nearest competitor, the Chevy Bolt.

Whether that’s enough to deliver Tesla enough market share is an open question. “Is it doable?” says Lindland. “Absolutely.” Toyota, for example, sells more than 250,000 cars per month in the US. But competition will be fierce. BMW will release two new electric models by 2020, and is accelerating its electric-car effort across its entire lineup. Mercedes plans to launch four EVs by 2018. Volvo will go all-electric by 2019. The Chevrolet Bolt is already on the road. Prices on EVs will go down at the same time that gas prices remain low. Even when the total cost of ownership for EVs falls below that of conventional cars (expected to happen in the next few years), a slightly higher sticker price may deter many buyers, argues Abuelsamid at Navigant. ”It’s going to be tough for mainstream consumers to make the jump until affordability gets much better,” he wrote.

But the biggest barrier to selling Model 3s to the masses? It may just be knowing about them, reports Elektrek. A recent survey of 2,500 American found that 60% were still “unaware of electric cars,” eclipsing concerns such as range or charging station availability. Here, even Musk’s showmanship may not be enough to move the market. The industry as a whole will need to find a sales strategy that equates electric cars as something suitable for any car buyer. Once buyers see an electric vehicle not as a different type of car, but as a better one, then the market for EV can truly take off."

In this world of maximum pricing, Apple could charge the super-rich the tens of thousands of dollars they would probably be willing to pay for iPhones, while poorer consumers would pay much less than the going rate.

Fortunately for rich consumers—and unfortunately poorer ones—this isn’t possible. Usually, companies are only able to offer their product at one price (less wealthy people would simply sell the product to richer people if they didn’t). Given this constraint, companies choose the price that will lead to the most profit, which is usually somewhere in the middle of how much the wealthiest and poorest are willing to pay.

Sometimes, companies do figure out a way to charge different prices to wealthier and poorer consumers for virtually the same product—economists call this “price discrimination.” They often do it by selling an intentionally limited version of the product. A perfect case of this intentional limiting came to light during Hurricane Irma.

In 2016, Tesla sold two different versions of their Model S and X electric cars. One version had a 60 kilowatt per hour battery, and another a 75. The 75-kilowatt version cost $9,000 more.

Prior to Irma’s landfall, Tesla announced that it would flip the proverbial switch, and allow the 60-kilowatt cars to become 75-kilowatt cars. This enabled the 60-kilowatt vehicles to go 230 miles per charge, rather than 200. “We hope that this allows you to travel to your next destination with confidence and ease,” Tesla wrote their Florida customers.

Tesla was able to upgrade the kilowattage in the cheaper version of the car because both models actually have the same 75-kilowatt battery. The company just chooses to limit the capacity in some cars so they can have two different price points.

The response to Tesla’s decision has been mixed. While some observers congratulated the company for proactively reacting to the impending storm, others were disturbed by the revelation that the company could so easily increase the capacity on their cars. If the battery could be more powerful without any extra cost to Tesla, ask critics, why deny this capability to certain drivers?

The answer: Limiting battery capacity actually makes Teslas more affordable.

The extra $9,000 that Tesla gets from its less price-sensitive customers is what allows it to charge a price for the lesser version of the car, the one that more cost-conscious consumers might purchase (though of course anyone purchasing a $60,000 Tesla is not poor). Perverse as it may seem, having a version of the car that gets less mileage actually makes it more accessible, which ultimately might make it better for the environment—assuming that Teslas are more environmentally friendly than the alternative car the Tesla buyer would have purchased.

The economist Alex Tabarrok of the blog Marginal Revolution points out that this is common for firms in research heavy industries. “A familiar example is software companies that offer a discounted or ‘student’ version of the product with fewer features,” write Tabarrok. “Since the software firm’s costs are mostly sunk R&D costs, the firm can make money selling a low-price version so long as doing so doesn’t cannibalize its high-willingness-to-pay customers…”

Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk has described the company’s car as a “sophisticated computer on wheels,” is much more like a software firm than other auto makers. It makes sense that they follow a similar pricing strategy."

But Tesla's journey to becoming this new company has not always been easy. While the company has celebrated plenty of achievements, it has also experienced its fair share of setbacks.

Here's a breakdown of the company's most defining moments since its founding."

At the unveiling of the Model 3 this evening at the company's design studio in Hawthorne, California, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car will deliver at least 215 miles of range beginning at just $35,000 — that's a bold claim, and an important one for Tesla to meet. Musk is ""fairly confident"" that deliveries will begin by the end of 2017, and ""you will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000, even with no options."" And it will be one of the safest cars in the world, according to Musk.

0-60 MPH in less than 6 seconds

Tesla says more than 130,000 preorders — buyers need to put $1,000 down — have been placed, and that number will continue to rise.

The base car will do 0-60 mph in less than 6 seconds, with versions that go ""much faster."" Range will be at least 215 miles, but Tesla hopes to exceed those numbers in the final car. All Model 3 cars will include support for Tesla's high-speed Supercharging network, because ""it's about going where you want to go,"" according to Musk. By the end of 2017, when the Model 3 launches, Tesla says it will have a total of 7,200 Superchargers, double the number available today.

215 miles of range, plus supercharger support is standard

Like the Model S, the Model 3 will come in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions, and there's a 15-inch landscape touchscreen inside — an interesting change from the 17-inch portrait touchscreen in the Model S and X. Autopilot hardware is standard, and all safety features will be active automatically. Five adults will fit comfortably — ""comfortably is the important part here,"" says Musk.

Watch: 4k race footage of the Tesla Model 3

The front to rear roof area — from the windshield all the way to the trunk — will be one continuous piece of glass. And, just like the Model S, it will have front and rear trunks for storage. ""More cargo capacity than any gasoline car of the same external dimensions,"" says Musk. You can even fit a 7-foot long surfboard on the inside.

starts at $35,000

The two current Tesla vehicles, the Model S and Model X, are both extremely expensive. Even with tax incentives, both cars easily push $100,000. In order for Tesla to sell ten times as many cars as it does now, it needs a much cheaper automobile. That's the Model 3. It's the future of the company.

But don't expect to get your hands on one any time soon. The Model 3 isn't expected to begin production until late 2017, more than 18 months from now. Tesla will happily take your preorder for a modest $1,000 down payment. Tesla plans to more than double the size of its dealership and service network by the end of next year, to sell and take care of all these new cars.

For comparison, the biggest direct competitor for the Model 3 is the Chevy Bolt. GM says that car will have an electric range greater than 200 miles and a price, after tax incentives, of around $30,000.

But today is all about the Model 3, the pinnacle of the Tesla Motors master plan. Elon Musk laid it all out in a blog post ten years ago:

Build sports car - The Tesla Roadster

Use that money to build an affordable car - The Model S

Use that money to build an even more affordable car - The Model 3

At the announcement of the Model 3 this evening, Elon Musk even thanked Model S and Model X purchasers for funding the development of the car. The Model 3 is the culmination of a decade's worth of work. Elon Musk is betting billions on it, and it needs to deliver. The future of Tesla Motors, quite literally, rides on its success."
https://www.wired.com/2016/03/meet-teslas-model-3-long-awaited-car-masses/,pos,1.0,9.768355287393128e-33,"Meet Tesla's Model 3, Its Long-Awaited Car for the Masses",2016-04-01 03:57:48,2019-06-24 14:18:45.669367,Alex Davies + Aarian Marshall + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"The $35,000 Tesla Model 3 is finally here. It is sleek, quick as hell, and meant for the masses. And it is the most important car the company will ever build.

The Model 3 is the car Tesla Motors has promised since the company's founding, the car that CEO Elon Musk is convinced will push EVs into the mainstream and the technology to an inflection point. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is the car Musk believes will change the world.

""It's very important to accelerate the transition to sustainable transport,"" Musk said on stage. ""This is really important for the future of the world.""

In person and on paper, the Model 3 is a stunner. It's a handsome sedan, with four doors and five seats, and all the comfort and practicality you'd expect of an upscale mid-size sedan. The battery is good for a 0 to 60 mph time under six seconds, a range of 215 miles. It's packed with tech, stylish, and a bargain if Tesla can deliver it at the $27,500 base price Musk promises you'll pay after the federal tax credit.

The specs and price are key, because so far Tesla Motors has aimed squarely at the affluent. The company's first three models—the innovative Roadster sports car, exquisite Model S sedan, and tech-slinging Model X SUV—made electric cars fun, cool, and compelling. The Model 3 is meant to do something greater: sell the masses on electric propulsion.

Tesla is hardly alone in hoping to do this and, frankly, got beaten in the race to build a $30K EV wth a triple-digit range by General Motors. In January, the Detroit stalwart introduced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, a battery electric hatchback with a range of 200 miles and a price of 30 grand after the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Still, Musk isn’t the slightest bit worried and, to be fair, has little reason to be. The Bolt is lovely, but Tesla has a proven ability to get people excited, and there's no denying the company has a cachet many automakers do not. You don't often see people lining up outside dealerships simply to place a $1,000 deposit on a car they haven't even seen—something that happened at many Tesla stores this week. By the time Musk pulled the sheet off the Model 3 at the sprawling Space X campus here in Hawthorne, California, 115,000 customers had put their money down.

""They’ll absolutely have a wow factor, because it’s Tesla,"" says Gary Silberg, an automotive analyst with KPMG. ""They’ll know how to market it, and from that perspective, there’s no doubt in my mind it’s gonna be a big success.""

Tesla doesn't have to worry about creating a market for the 3. Nor does it have to worry about actually building it. No, the upstart automaker has to do something much harder.

If the company is to truly influence, let alone change, how humanity moves around, it must become more than a niche automaker building luxury vehicles and playing gadfly to the big players. That means producing vehicles on a massive scale and generating sustainable profits. To do that, Tesla must think and act a lot more like the very automakers Musk is so quick to ridicule as out-dated and old-fashioned.

It's time for Tesla to grow up.

A Different Kind of Car Company

Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning founded Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk, flush with cash after selling PayPal to eBay for $1.4 billion, joined in early 2004 as its chairman and primary benefactor. He took over as CEO in 2008, shortly after the debut of the company's first car, the Roadster. The two-seater was a proof of concept, designed to show that EVs could be cool. It was based on the Lotus Elise, hit 60 mph in 3.7, and squeezed 245 miles from a 950-pound battery. Car & Driver called it “a revelation”. Tesla sold about 2,400 Roadsters in four years.

Then came the Model S, a truly remarkable sedan good for almost 300 miles on a charge. Even now, four years after its debut, the sedan remains a marvel. It's everything most people would ever want in a car—roomy, comfortable, practical, quick, and reliable. Motor Trend and Automobile Magazine called it the car of the year in 2013, and Consumer Reports gave it its best score ever.

The strategy is to enter at the high end of the market, then drive down market as fast as possible. Elon Musk in 2006

Tesla has steadily improved the S, using over-the-air software updates to make every car even better. It made hardware changes, too, offering a second motor to provide four wheel drive, bigger batteries for more range, improved electronics, and self-driving capabilities. The 0 to 60 time plunged to a stomach-dropping 2.8 seconds—on par with six-figure exotics.

Meanwhile, Tesla built an international network of 1,600 “superchargers” where owners can plug in for free and charge the battery to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. It fought for the right to sell cars directly to customers. It took over an enormous factory once owned by GM and Toyota. It broke ground on a ""gigafactory"" where it will work with Panasonic to build almost unimaginable numbers of batteries. And in October, it introduced the Model X, a handsome, falcon-winged SUV based on the Model S.

So far, so good.

The Master Plan

All of this has unfolded in accordance with the ""master plan"" Musk laid out in a 2006 blog post. ""Almost any new technology initially has high unit cost before it can be optimized and this is no less true for electric cars,"" he wrote. ""The strategy of Tesla is to enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model.""

Thirteen years after Eberhard and Tarpenning founded the company, Tesla remains firmly entrenched in step one of that process. Its cars are wonderful, but have only gotten more expensive over time. When he announced the Model S in 2009, Musk said it would start at $57,400. Today the base price is $70,000 and the average sale price is $105,000, according to an estimate Morgan Stanley made in 2014, before the company added pricey—and popular—upgrades like autopilot and all-wheel drive. (Tesla will not reveal the average sale price of its cars.)

Nobody makes money—or not a lot of money—on the low-end brands. Automotive Analyst Gary Silberg

Of course, there's a reason automakers love the luxury market—it's where the money is. ""Nobody makes money—or not a lot of money—on the low-end brands,"" Silberg says. Hans-Werner Kaas, a senior partner at McKinsey, says luxury cars offer margins around eight to nine percent, double what you usually get from volume products.

Even with Porsche, Audi, and others jumping into the high-end EV market, there’s no reason to think Tesla wouldn't hold its own in an increasingly crowded market. It could very easily continue selling 90,000 or so sedans and SUVs a year and keep everyone happy.

But that's not how you change the world. And Musk, more than anything, wants to change the world. It's true with Solar City, it's true with SpaceX, and it's absolutely true with Tesla Motors, a company with the stated mission of ""accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable transportation."" You don't do that selling cars only to people in places like Palo Alto and Los Angeles and Scarsdale.

You do it selling cars to everyone.

A Fresh Face

The Model 3 is the car to do that. Autopilot features come standard, and Musk promises five-star safety ratings in all categories. Inside, the Model 3 feels just like the Model S and X—sleek and minimalist. The whole roof is glass, which makes any sunroof look like a peephole. And Tesla's trademark enormous center console screen—here 15 inches instead of the usual 17—has been flipped to sit horizontally.

""You will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000,"" Musk says. The first cars, produced in late 2017, will go to West Coast customers, with deliveries gradually moving east. Europe and Asia will follow, along with right-hand drive markets. Current Model S and X owners get priority. Tesla's history teaches us most customers will have to wait months, or years, to get their car. And it shows us that car is worth waiting for.

Growing Up by Driving Down

For all Musk's talk of disrupting the industry, Tesla Motors has been little more than a voluble pest. The company sold 50,580 cars last year. General Motors moves that many in a single weekend.

That explains how GM won the race to build the 200-mile, $30,000 electric car. It threw time and money and resources at a really hard problem—building an EV that delivers on those two metrics is no easy feat—and spent more than a decade solving it. And it relied upon the sprawling infrastructure and established supply chain that makes building and selling huge numbers of cars (relatively) easy.

And that is the world Tesla is entering with the Model 3. The fixed costs of the auto industry—the equipment, materials, labor, and so on—make for slim profit margins on a $35,000 car. “You need to have your different types of cost and profit levels really tightly under control for making money in such a segment,” McKinsey’s Kaas says. And you have to drive volume. To get your return on upfront investments into equipment, Kaas says, “you need scale.”

They have to make sure that they make a profit. Kelley Blue Book Senior Analyst Rebecca Lindland

Tesla is slowly getting there, and investing $1.5 billion to do it. Battery production at the Gigafactory in Nevada should begin later this year. Things are ramping up at its automotive factory in Fremont, California, where GM and Toyota turned out half a million Vibes and Corollas and other models annually. Tesla wants to hit that number by 2020, which would make it as big as Dodge. And the company is expanding a retail network that already includes more than 200 stores in North America, Europe, China, and Japan. It's going to double the size of the Supercharger network.

The challenge is scaling up quickly enough to meet demand and make money. General Motors can afford to take a loss on the Bolt because more profitable models pad the bottom line. Tesla—which has never had a profitable year—doesn't necessarily have this luxury, especially if the 3 is to be its primary product. “They have to make sure that they make a profit,” says Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.

Profitability means using many of the tricks everyone else uses. Sharing parts between models, buying in volume from suppliers, and finding the best prices on things like wire harnesses, insulation, vents, and the myriad other parts consumers never see. “That’s where you need to save as much money as possible,” Lindland says.

It's an exceedingly tough game to play. Tesla has clearly done far better, and lasted far longer, than other upstarts (Tucker, Delorean, Fisker) that thought they could rewrite the rules. But an increasingly competitive market has killed far more established automakers. Remember Saab? How about Pontiac?

As if that weren't enough, there's another challenge to Tesla’s down-market move. The $7,500 federal tax credit that pushes the base price of the Model 3 below $30,000 won’t last forever. It only applies to the first 200,000 electric vehicles a manufacturer sells in the US. Tesla will be approaching that limit by the time the 3 hits the market late next year.

But there's some good news that will help Tesla.

The Good News

One of the biggest reasons EVs cost so much (compared to gas-powered cars) is the battery. The battery can account for one-third of the price of the car, which is why something like the Nissan Leaf or Fiat 500e costs about $30,000, while offering only about 100 miles of range. But those costs are falling, fast. Between 2010 and 2015, the average cost per kilowatt hour (kWh) dropped 65 percent, from $1,000 to $350, according to a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “By 2022,” the report says, “the unsubsidized total cost of ownership of [battery electric vehicles] will fall below that of an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

It’s also important to remember that the Model 3 is just the start of a new line of vehicles. Musk has said Tesla will use the car’s core structure as the basis for a series of vehicles, including a small crossover. It’s a common industry move, a way to amortize the infrastructure costs over more vehicles. And taking preorders will help Tesla gauge how many cars it needs to build, avoiding the risk of producing more stock than it can sell.

Third, selling cars isn’t Tesla’s only route to the bank. California is one of 10 states that require automakers to offer at least some zero emissions vehicles. Automakers can circumvent that mandate by buying “ZEV credits” from automakers who find themselves with surplus credits. Tesla, which has a surplus of credits because it only sells electric cars, earned $51 million selling spare credits in the first quarter of 2015 alone. Those credits are slowly losing value under the complicated regulations governing them, but selling a lot more cars should make up for that.

Ultimately, though, Tesla has earned the benefit of the doubt. Musk has consistently made big promises, then proved the doubters and naysayers wrong, first with the Roadster, then with the S and the X. Bringing zero-emission motoring to the proletariat and radically remaking how people get around is Tesla's biggest promise, and Musk's greatest challenge, yet. But together they've made it this far. Musk doesn't always deliver on time or within budget, but he always delivers."

These early buyers didn't know what the car would look like -- a lot like a smaller Model S with an up-turned nose -- or that it would have a starting price of exactly $35,000. They also didn't know that it would go from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds and have a range of at least 215 miles.

""We don't make slow cars,"" CEO Elon Musk said at the car's unveiling, adding that these are minimum specs the company hopes to exceed. ""You will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000, or even close, even if you get no options,"" he said later.

Musk said the Model 3 will seat five comfortably, and he emphasized ""comfortably."" After the launch event at the automaker's Southern California design studio, Tesla executives gave guests brief rides in prototype Model 3 cars. The vehicle does, in fact, seat at least four people comfortably. Five would probably be a squeeze.

The windshield and back window nearly touch, leaving only a narrow bar of actual roof to separate them, which makes for a nearly complete view of the sky over occupants' heads. There is no gauge cluster in front of the driver, only air-conditioning vents.

A rectangular touchpad screen mounted on the dashboard between the front seats is the only information display. The car's speed is displayed in the upper left corner within easy view of the driver.

The car I rode in was an all-wheel-drive dual-motor version which would cost more than $35,000, but also be more powerful that the base model. Acceleration was neck-strainingly quick, and the ride was -- as always with electric cars -- strangely quiet.

Like the larger Model S, the Model 3 has a trunk and a ""frunk,"" meaning there are large storage areas at both ends of the car. That gives it more storage space than any gasoline-powered car of similar size, Musk boasted.

Musk stuck by his promise that the Model 3 will go on sale by the end of next year. The Fremont, Calif. factory where Tesla (TSLA) builds its cars used to produce nearly half a million cars a year when it was owned by General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM), he said, so it should have no trouble meeting Tesla's needs for this third model.

That’s not much for a car that Musk, a significant part of Wall Street, and much of the technology community, believe could tip the world away from gasoline-driven vehicles, curb climate change, and profoundly shake up urban lifestyles everywhere. If the make-or-break vehicle is a blockbuster, it will justify investors’ big bet—they have valued Tesla not like a car company, but a Silicon Valley technology startup. But if it sells only at middling scale like current electrics, cash-burning Tesla could go bust.

Though it was short, the drama was palpable in a glitzy nighttime ceremony in Hawthorne, California, as Musk summoned three of the Model 3s onto the stage, accompanied by sweeping music and roving lights. The car will cost $35,000, and go 215 miles on a single charge, he said, 15 miles further than generally expected.

As proof of the car’s credibility, he said in the end, more than 115,000 buyers around the world had plopped down $1,000 each to reserve a Model 3, sight unseen. The crowd whooped.

Entry-level luxury

The Model 3 is a compact, four-door sedan that will seat five adults, and comes with a number of standard features that are normally found on luxury cars, including autonomous functionality. It also has two trunks, one in front and one in back.

Tesla Motors The Model 3.

Cosmin Laslau, an analyst with Lux Research, a market research firm, called the car a triumph. He said that its design bests the first-mover in the nascent $35,000, 200-mile electric category—the Chevy Bolt, which General Motors unveiled in January and, by delivering its first cars by the end of 2016, will beat Musk to the market by at least a year.

“Tesla has been able to keep its premium design look in the Model 3: Whereas the Bolt looks very much like the economy hatchback it is, the Model 3’s design actually looks the part of entry-level luxury,” Laslau told Quartz. “This is the right design to compete in the $35,000 bracket against BMW, Audi, and others. They nailed it. Kudos to their design team, bringing downmarket details like the flush door handles and huge interior touchscreens that are becoming Tesla signature touches.”

Here’s a quick look at the front interior:

Whether the number of pre-orders holds remains to be seen since the money is refundable, said Sam Jaffe, an analyst with Cairn, a research firm. “Far more important will be how many reservations they have next summer,” Jaffe told Quartz. “If that number is over 250,000 at that point, they will most definitely have a successful product launch.”

Musk was a bit equivocal on when the cars would be ready for delivery to its customers. “I feel fairly confident they will be delivered next year,” he said, leaving apparent wiggle room in case—as has been his habit so far—he is late.

Musk has explicitly built up to this moment

The unveiling was the culmination of a decade of strategizing by Musk, who has said since 2006 that his objective was to bring electric cars to the masses. His first three electrics—the Roadster, the S sedan and the X crossover SUV—all cost north of $100,000 once normal extras were factored in. All along, he promised that the approximate price of his mainstream vehicle would be in the $30,000 range.

Musk has not vowed to build the largest electric car company in the world, but to trigger the creation of a mainstream electric car industry. In 2014 he declared Tesla’s patents more or less open source (more or less, because Musk retains the prerogative to decide whether a specific company or lab can use them for free).

All along, he has wished Tesla rivals the best of luck in electric cars, too—by most appearances, a sincere wish. For Tesla to succeed, Musk believes, there has to be a whole ecosystem of electrics; consumers need a large variety to choose from.

Most of the rest of the industry has responded aggressively, perhaps out of fear that Musk may be on to something. GM, Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, Nissan, and others have announced accelerated plans to put electrics on the road by the end of the decade. VW, facing heavy financial and legal challenges over its use of a defeat device on its diesel cars, has been especially passionate about making the shift to electrics—all its brands, including Audi and Porsche, have recently announced imminent plans in the space.

But Tesla has been the star of the show, based in part on Musk’s stagy personality, but also his stylish design touches, exquisite taste that analysts compare with that of Steve Jobs, the late Apple CEO.

In the short March 31 ceremony, Musk emphasized that the Model 3 would meet painstaking safety standards, and include a glass roof that he said provides “a feeling of openness.” Although it is not clear that this feature will be widely demanded, he said that a 7-foot surfboard could fit inside the car.

Musk also set out to answer to widespread criticism that, even if electrics turn out to be affordable and desirable, cities are not equipped for electric cars. He said that Tesla is doubling the number of so-called Supercharging stations around the world to 7,200, and the number of ordinary charging stations to 15,000, by the end of 2017. He also said that Tesla is also doubling the number of its servicing facilities to 441.

A Tesla owner will be able to charge up and obtain servicing near any medium-size urban area in the US, Europe and Asia. “You can conveniently go where you want to go when you want,” he said.

As usual, the setting was important

The announcement was made amid a party at the Tesla Design Studio in Hawthorne, a community near the best southern California beaches and just southeast of Los Angeles International Airport. The same lot contains a facility for SpaceX, Musk’s commercial space cargo company. A full house of some 800 guests were offered a full bar including champagne and liquor, plus at one point a Talking Heads soundtrack, and snacks including tuna tacos. Here is what it looked like inside (courtesy @lancethedriver on Instagram).

In the hours before the unveiling, lines formed at Tesla stores around the world to reserve a Model 3: In a series of posts on Reddit, someone in Palo Alto reported 500 people in line; someone else counted 200 in Montreal; another 500 in Austin an hour before the store opened; 130 people in Stockholm; and a few dozen in Amsterdam. Model 3 reservees debated one another as to how early they are in the queue to get their cars once they are available.

In the end, Musk made the day about personal showmanship, showing up outside the Tesla store at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles, 14 miles north of his Hawthorne office, and thanking those standing in line for the Model 3. One of those with whom he shook hands, Dan Mitchell, tweeted this selfie."

Reuters/Bobby Yip; Business Insider/Dave Smith • No major automaker with 500,000 pre-orders for a new car would be so slow to hit full production.

• Tesla is actually shifting from serving a small market well to a potentially large market badly.

• There are options, but Tesla doesn't appear to want to choose them.

Tesla semi-officially launched the Model 3 in July, delivering 30 vehicles, mainly to insiders and employees. In August, the delivery tally rose to 75, according to InsideEVs.com.

That's more than double the July number, and don't forget that at Tesla's July handover event, CEO Elon Musk stressed that the company would be in ""production hell"" for at least six months.

Tesla's goal is to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles per month by the end of the year. A good start would be hitting an anticipated 1,500 total for the month of September. The pressure is on because the carmaker has something like 500,000 pre-orders for the vehicle — but has never manufactured even 100,000 annually.

You might justifiably ask yourself, ""Hey, hasn't Tesla been around for over a decade? Why is it so hard for the company to execute on its model basic business — building cars?

Over 100 years ago ...

Contrast this with the production ramp of the famous Ford Model T. Henry Ford's revolutionary mass-produced automobile started what we would now call full production in about 1911, when 12,000 examples rolled off the assembly line. By 1914, that number had risen to 300,000.

If you don't like case studies from over 100 years ago, ponder the production curve for the Chevy Bolt, an all-electric, 200-miles-of-range vehicles that General Motors launched last October (in limited markets) and priced at about $37,500 before tax credits.

Chevy sold about 600 Bolts in December of 2016 and took that number to about 1,200 the following month. In August, the company sold 2,100 cars.

Demand for the Bolt is nowhere near what Tesla has seen for the Model 3. But that's a distraction. For vehicles in high demand, GM has seen dramatic sales increases and pushed production accordingly: the Cadillac XT5 SUV sold 300 units last April, but in August, the brand moved over 7,000.

It isn't complicated

This isn't that complicated. A carmaker — or any other business, for that matter — see demand and capitalize on it, ideally at a profit, unless the objective is to amass market share and eventually pricing power through the development of a monopoly (a risky move, traditionally, as that attracts antitrust attention from the federal government).

It is complicated for Tesla because the company isn't exploiting its actual market advantage, instead, it is trying to create and dominate a new market. With its Model S and Model X vehicles, Tesla dominates the tiny market for luxury electric cars. But it wants to capture a massive portion of the currently marginal market for mass-market EVs — and by doing so encourage a rapid transition of all auto transportation from gas to electric power (Musk's overarching and quite noble plan).

The problem is that although the Model S and Model X are compelling, Tesla isn't very good at building them in even modest volumes, falling short on delivery guidance two years in a row. Demand for these vehicles might be topping out anyway, and Musk has said that S/X production was designed for a run-rate of about 100,000 units annually.

So what we're really witnessing here is a 14-year-old carmaker starting from scratch.

A source of frustration

This is frustrating for experienced auto-industry observers to watch, as even though Tesla has its critics, most people are rooting for the company to succeed and aren't hung up on the debate about whether the company deserves its $60-billion market cap or should be shorted into oblivion on Wall Street.

It's frustrating because although Tesla isn't a veteran of automaking, it's been in the game long enough to know how to do it. If Chevy had 500,000 pre-orders for the Bolt, you can bet it would have ramped production to 10,000 a month in, well, a few months. Some of Tesla's challenges can be traced to the supply chain — Musk recently noted that the company has finally gotten the attention of what he called the A Team at the top-tier suppliers.

They've already come, so just build it. Tesla But these explanations go only so far. If Henry Ford could figure it out at a time when we still had horses and carriages in city streets, Musk should be able to do it now, with a robot-packed factory, software-optimized production, and a vast network of suppliers to call on.

Even if he can't, there's always contract manufacturing: big car companies send their overflow demand to be serviced by companies like Magna, the largest contract player in the business.

If Tesla doesn't want to make customers wait four years to get their Model 3s, it needs to go from zero to 100 mph in the factory. Its track record suggests that, despite Musk's optimistic predictions, that won't happen. This actually isn't a big deal — unless Tesla insists on doing everything itself. And spending a long time in production hell."

Learn how its bold mission and Elon Musk's personality created a brand that attracts both fans and critics.

One early Friday evening in September 2016, I stood on the sidewalk in a St. Louis neighborhood as a white Tesla Model S85, driven by James Majerus, pulled up to the curb to pick me up. The twenty-six-year-old, a Tesla investor, is also a board member of the St. Louis Tesla Enthusiast Meetup group. We were heading to dinner at Michael's Bar and Grill to meet the gang.

There were half a dozen people in attendance—all there to share their love of Tesla with me. While there are a handful of other Tesla Meetup groups in the US alone, St. Louis has the largest contingent. Founded by Elizabeth Gattra in December 2012, the first meeting attracted about eight people. The group now includes 380 so-called ""enthusiasts,"" with about 50-100 active participants. I wanted to learn what sparked the group's creation and why they were dedicating time to promote the company.

""In those early days,"" said Gattra, ""those of us waiting for our cars were licking up every drop of information we could get from people who had already gotten their cars.""

They were ""kind of living vicariously through Tesla owners,"" Gattra said. ""There was a lot of Tesla talk, and talking about our experiences, and tricks and tips."" Back then, the group printed business cards, and Gattra hand-wrote notes. ""If anyone saw a Tesla, we would put a business card on their windshield or whatever,"" said Jim Versey, another member of the Meetup group, ""and we handed them out at car shows.""

The Meetup group is a cheerleader for Tesla. ""We do national drive week, we do birthdays, and we [attend] various other car shows,"" said Gattra. They attend the St. Louis Auto Show and the Saint Patrick's Day Parade every year, too.

And the group is not exclusively Tesla owners. ""Anybody who appreciates Tesla or wants a Tesla someday is welcome, and we do our best to make that known,"" Guy Vils, another member, told me. ""People are intimidated because of the cost [of a Tesla], and think there's going to be some kind of exclusivity associated with the group,"" he said. ""But we're very open.""

""When I first joined the group,"" said Versey, ""I expected it to be a bunch of old dudes, basically. Like, golf guys."" But when, at the first meeting, they went around the room stating what everybody did for a living, ""it was like 75% IT of some sort or another,"" he said. ""Coders and computer people.""

This kind of enthusiasm and grassroots marketing is what most companies would die for.

Every company can study Tesla, which will likely be a business school case study for years to come, as part of their broader digital transformation efforts. With some pizzazz, technology and marketing, many companies can appear forward-looking and cultivate better customer relationships. Tesla's approach boils down to tying a brand's mission to a larger vision, developing a 1:1 relationship with customers and do what your rivals are scared to do.

The birth of a movement

How did ""computer people"" end up becoming luxury car owners?

In 2003, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, two engineers from San Carlos, CA, set out to build a company that could commercialize the electric vehicle in the form of a luxury car. They named the company Tesla Motors, after the Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla, who is credited for inventing the electric lightbulb before Thomas Edison was able to market it. Like many Silicon Valley startups, Tesla Motors had a bold mission: It would ""accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""

Fast forward to 2008: Elon Musk, billionaire business magnate and former head of PayPal, was named CEO of Tesla Motors and the company introduced its first sports car, the Roadster. Over the next several years, Tesla took the lead in a niche market—electric luxury cars—venturing into mostly uncharted territory. By 2016, the company had earned a reputation for producing vehicles that offered cutting-edge technology, a premier driving experience, and a cool, sleek look.

And yet, global sales of Teslas in 2016 were shy of 80,000—less than a tenth of a percent of worldwide auto sales. The electric vehicle market is still miniscule, hovering around 2% of overall auto sales. And the cars themselves are hardly affordable for the masses—a 2017 Tesla Model S sedan can cost between $68,000 to $134,500, depending on the package.

But to Tesla—and to many of its customers—sales, alone, do not necessarily define success. Success, in the eyes of Musk and his supporters, is about something else: Changing the world.

Part of Tesla's mission depends on the conception of the company as more than just a carmaker. And that's not a tough argument to make. Beyond producing cars, Tesla Motors—now, simply, Tesla—is also a battery company, a solar panel production company, and, since November 2016, a ""glass technology"" company. In addition to leading Tesla, Musk is also the founder of SpaceX, a rocket company that is crafting plans to travel to Mars. And in March 2017, plans emerged of Musk's new company called Neuralink, aiming to merge human brains with computers.

But Tesla, above all, is a tech company. And in the same vein as early Apple adopters, Tesla loyalists form its backbone. These devoted fans are, in part, how Tesla has majorly challenged the traditional auto industry for the first time in 50 years.

Who are Tesla's customers?

Who are these 100,000+ Tesla owners? While they are paying a pretty penny for these cars, their reasons don't fully align with the reasons other high-end car owners flock to Porches and Maseratis.

The current average price of the cars (before the $35,000 Model 3 is available) translates into a wealthier group of owners.

""You get a very different group of people [from traditional luxury car owners],"" said Michael Ramsey, Research Director at Gartner. ""These are people who really wanted this car, and feel like they can justify it because they're not spending money on gas, because the car has so many cool capabilities—and they just never wanted a car so much that they could justify the cost.""

""There is a single-minded devotion to Tesla from its owners that is very uncharacteristic in the auto industry."" Michael Ramsey, Research Director at Gartner

That rang true with the St. Louis Tesla group. When I asked the members about their motivations to purchase a Tesla, I was surprised to hear that many of them wouldn't have normally bought an expensive car like this—but they saw something different in Tesla.

""A lot of people reach up to afford a Tesla, where they wouldn't [for a different high-end model],"" said Versey. ""I never would have considered a Lexus or a BMW or an Audi.""

Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and associate professor of engineering at the University of Southern California, agrees with the assessment. ""I don't think Teslas are just for the 'luxury-car' folks,"" he said. Instead, Miller sees the vehicles appealing to different groups: ""The techies, the early-technology adopters, and of course, the green/environmental population.""

In terms of loyalty to the brand, the ""use of the term 'cult,'"" said Miller, ""seems fairly accurate.""

But with the techies, early-adopters, and green contingent, there's still one group missing: The sports car lovers.

At Strategic Vision, Edwards has spent years researching who owns electric cars, and why they own them. When it comes to Tesla, 92% of new vehicle buyers said that the vehicle is clearly fun to drive. That's compared to 56% of those who purchase gas vehicles.

What are the other characteristics? They're mostly Caucasians, said Edwards. And they are often ""fairly wealthy or exceptionally wealthy,"" he said, with a median income in the neighborhood of a quarter million. Tesla owners, said Edwards, are sports car lovers who are ""not buying an electric vehicle. They're buying a premium sports car, a premium luxury vehicle. The fact that it is an electric car is part of the innovation, but it's not the principle reason they're doing it.""

""There are a lot of people who, when they discover the performance of the electric vehicles at those lower speeds, the lower torques, become convinced that it's the perfect vehicle. They love it. They see all the wonderful things about it,"" said Edwards.

What Tesla has done, he said, and a large reason for its success, is that it created a brand new customer base.

""Musk has created the most-loved car in the nation, from our data,"" said Edwards.

Not your typical automaker

""Here's a company that has been the first actually successful American startup car company since Chrysler, basically,"" said Ramsey. ""The way Tesla gathered attention and devotion from a set of customers is completely uncharacteristic, outside of anything short of the millionaires who buy Bugattis and Ferraris,"" he said. ""There is a single-minded devotion to Tesla from its owners that is very uncharacteristic in the auto industry. All of the other carmakers want to have that, but they can't.""

Other automakers are bound by ""shackles,"" according to Ramsey, that have held them back from gaining this status. Tesla, he said, developed unique workarounds.

For one, when you want to buy a Tesla, there are no dealers, so there's no price haggling—all customers pay the same amount for the same car. For another, the cars are made-to-order. Ramsey sees this as part of Tesla's appeal. ""There's an egalitarianism to it, and people are like, 'Okay, I'm not getting ripped off,'"" he said. Also, he said, Tesla isn't simply an electric vehicle—""It's beautiful, it's highly capable, and it's huge."" Why huge? It's roomy inside because it saves space used by traditional engines.

On top of it all, ""they're fun to drive, and they have all kinds of cool technical features that are hard to find on other vehicles,"" Ramsey said.

An important factor in Tesla's success is those tech features. While there are other cars that have impressive batteries and attractive, sporty exteriors, Tesla's over-the-air capability—which allows drivers to instantly download new software upgrades to the car—makes it stand apart from other auto companies.Tesla's over-the-air capability is, essentially, centralized computing. While many other cars have distributed computing capability, connecting certain pieces of the car through a central portal, the portal ""doesn't have a brain in it,"" Ramsey said. ""It's like an outlet with a bunch of different plugs."" Tesla, instead, has a more coordinated platform for updating software. Also, through a partnership with AT&T, all Teslas equipped with a modem and embedded SIM card come with pre-paid internet connectivity—meaning the transfer of real-time data via radio signal, safety diagnostics and other information related to driver behavior.

""Tesla's real advantage is they've got a really strong brand,"" said Ramsey, ""and they've got this over-the-air platform that everyone else is just afraid of, or incapable of offering, because of the infrastructure it takes to implement. I have long considered this the single reason that Tesla has an advantage on every other car company,"" he said.

Who is Elon Musk?

But highlighting Tesla's innovations tells only half of the story: The company is also a target of criticism that borders on condemnation.

Why? It's not the company itself that's at the root of how it's perceived—it's Tesla's leader. You could call Musk the Kanye West of the auto world: Theatrical, arrogant, and by some measures, genius. And, like Kanye, Musk has fans and haters.

You've got a CEO who is incredibly unique,"" said Ramsey. ""Really, [the attention Tesla gets] is not even about Tesla half the time. It's about Elon Musk.""

""The guy running Tesla is also the founder of a rocket ship company,"" said Ramsey. ""He is a great mind that is incredibly interesting, who people look up to. So the cult of personality around Tesla is really as much about Elon as it is about the car or the company.""

Musk's grandiose personality remains the subject of much debate.

There's a huge split in opinion of him as a public figure versus as a manager versus as a person one-on-one,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina and expert in autonomous vehicles. ""Reconciling each of those images is another fascinating project in its own right.""

But while opinions on Musk range widely, there is agreement that he has a singular vision. Musk is ""very clear about what he wants,"" said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision. ""He relies more on his own intuition and what he believes should be the next phase of where the world, or where us as a human species are going, rather than [where] other people are telling him we should go.""

Ramsey agrees. It's not that other automakers couldn't have developed the technology, he said. ""They absolutely could have, but they didn't and Tesla did,"" said Ramsey. ""Elon is fearless. He is part showman. There is absolutely an aspect to what he does, like a, 'Look, here's my vision, get on board. This is going to happen.'""

""Elon is not afraid to buck convention,"" said Ramsey. ""This is another reason people like Tesla: They don't ask for permission. They do it.""

Tesla vs. Detroit

Perhaps nowhere is the animosity toward Tesla felt more strongly than in Detroit, headquarters of the American auto industry.

One measure of the friction can be gauged by Tesla's presence at the North American International Auto Show, held in Detroit each January. Although Tesla has attended in the past, it did not participate in 2017. While auto shows can be a good place to unveil new models, ultimately, said Ramsey, car shows are about selling cars.

""A lot of people in Detroit have very strong feelings on Tesla, including a lot of skepticism about technologies or the safety engineering. There are conversations in which people are saying, 'We're waiting for the big crash, the big failure.'"" Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina and expert in autonomous vehicles

""It's a dealer event, and you can't buy a Tesla in Michigan because there are no [Tesla] dealers there,"" he said. Tesla can't have a dealer there because Michigan doesn't allow manufacturers to have their own dealership, which has been ""a huge issue for Tesla,"" said Ramsey. ""State-by-state, Tesla has been fighting legislatures over the ability to sell directly,"" said Ramsey. ""Franchise dealers feel like their business model is endangered if manufacturers start selling cars directly to consumers.""

But the friction extends past Detroit. ""Tesla has a general disdain for auto shows,"" said Ramsey. ""They don't play by everyone else's rules.""

And there's also tension between Tesla and other electric vehicle manufacturers.

Despite relatively small sales in the context of the auto industry, by December 2016, Tesla had sold more than 186,000 electric cars worldwide, making the company the second largest purely electric car manufacturer after the Renault-Nissan Alliance.

Electric vehicles have, in some form, been around for more than 20 years. But Tesla adopted a different approach, said Chelsea Sexton, electric car advocate and advisor.

""It cultivated a super standoffish, arrogant, attitude from the start,"" she said. ""Kind of called every other EV that came before, or is coming now, 'punishment cars,'"" she said. ""It's the 'everyone from Detroit is stupid' mindset,"" said Sexton.

And while Musk isn't the only one to hold that view, he ""promoted it and ran with it,"" she said.

But despite conflicting opinions on Tesla and Musk, there seems to be widespread acknowledgment that Tesla and Detroit are at loggerheads.

""A lot of people in Detroit have very strong feelings on Tesla, including a lot of skepticism about its technologies or the safety engineering,"" said Smith. ""There are conversations in which people are saying, 'We're waiting for the big crash, the big failure.'""

Tesla's challenges

Tesla's ""move-forward"" attitude may be both its strength and its Achilles' heel. While the reality is that this mindset has resulted in vehicles with capabilities other automakers are ""unwilling or unable to give you,"" said Ramsey, the company has also been sharply criticized for releasing semi-autonomous technology—in the case of Tesla Autopilot—before that technology was generally deemed safe enough to be used by the public.

Last May, I visited Tesla's headquarters in Palo Alto and tested the technology for myself. After being instructed to pay full attention and keep hands on the wheel while engaged in this semi-autonomous mode, I slid into the driver's seat, took the exit for Highway 280 South, and pulled the turning lever towards me to put the car into Autopilot mode. The feeling of the vehicle moving by itself, over the curvy Los Altos hills, was completely exhilarating.

A month later, Joshua Brown was driving his Tesla Model S—which was engaged in Autopilot mode—on a Florida highway when a white semi-truck crossed his path in the blinding sun. Neither Brown nor the Autopilot system braked in time, and the crash killed Brown, resulting in the first-known fatality while a car was engaged in Autopilot.

""There is now an established track record of Elon overpromising. That's worked so far, but there's a point at which the bloom comes off that rose."" Chelsea Sexton, electric car advocate and advisor

Critics who were already worried about the technology used the accident to reinforce their view that Tesla had stepped too far too soon. But while the accident made headlines worldwide, it was not unexpected. Smith and several other autonomous driving experts had previously expressed concerns about how the incident, which they believed was inevitable, would impact the social adoption of autonomous vehicles.

Missy Cummings, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, said Tesla drivers may not be aware of the limits of Autopilot.

""When you generate the kind of hype that Musk does, people who already have a Tesla think that their cars are more capable than they are. And we see in the case of Joshua Brown what that leads to,"" she said. ""I don't mind Elon Musk trying to generate business, but what he does, he instills false confidence in people for a capability that is simply not there.""

Cummings has a ""love-hate"" relationship with Musk. ""I would like him to be successful, but I worry that he's over-claiming the power of the technology,"" she said. ""And when he tweets about the capabilities of his car, he potentially can set the entire community back by overstepping his bounds.""

But the Tesla community—and even Brown's family—rallied around the company as it faced angry critics.

""The long and the short of it is, you can't stop progress,"" said Gattra. ""We are going to have autonomous driving cars, okay? Are we going to have hiccups? Yes, but we have hiccups today.

""We're going to see that with Autopilot. People are going to get overconfident. Everybody who drives a Tesla should realize that they have to pay attention, there is risk, and they have to decide how much risk they're going to take,"" she said.

The future of Tesla

Regardless of whether Tesla fans stick by the company as it faces criticism, a question remains: Is Tesla's model sustainable and scalable?

Tesla has promised its next major product, the Model 3, will arrive in 2018. This will be its first mainstream car, with a relatively modest price tag starting at $35,000. And beyond that, Musk has stated another bold claim: The Model 3 will be equipped with the hardware that will eventually make it capable of fully-autonomous driving, once the software is available.

""There has to be a point at which tweeting is no longer a sustainable communication strategy. They're gonna have to start making the cars."" Chelsea Sexton, electric car advocate and advisor

But the release of the Model 3 is significant in a larger way: Tesla sees it as bringing the company closer to its mission of delivering an electric vehicle to the masses.

There was an enthusiastic response to the news about the Model 3, and hours after the announcement for pre-orders, there were more than 100,000 reservations for the car—and by March 2017, nearly 400,000. Whether Tesla can meet the demand, and whether another carmaker can produce a similar car first, is an open question.

And, some experts still question whether Tesla can succeed with its current ""full steam ahead"" attitude.

""There has to be a point at which tweeting is no longer a sustainable communication strategy,"" said Sexton. ""They're gonna have to start making the cars.""

She says we still don't know much in terms of how the cars will be sold. ""We've seen it with the Model S and X, but there's a point at which you burn through the waiting list and you still have cars to sell,"" Sexton said, ""especially if they're doing the volumes they're promising."" For reference, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told Forbes that he expects Tesla to produce in the neighborhood of 2,000—not the 10,000 per week Tesla claims it will produce—in the fall of 2016.

""Looking at all of the overly rosy claims,"" Sexton said, ""there is now an established track record of Elon overpromising. That's worked so far, but there's a point at which the bloom comes off that rose. I would love to know the strategy for when that happens.""

Sexton also sees collaboration as a critical strategy for Tesla if the company wants to move forward.

""The island approach will only work for so long,"" she said. Tesla, she said, needs to partner with other automakers, opening up patents, or offer a partnership on the Supercharger network, the network of fast-charging stations for the cars, for example.

Jeremy Carlson, senior analyst with IHS Automotive, says that Tesla's Model 3 will compete with other luxury car companies. But he sees another potential obstacle for the company: Engaging in mobility services, such as ride-sharing and car-sharing.

Tesla released its ""Master Plan, Part Deux"" in July 2016, which includes ride-sharing in its business plan. But ""we don't exactly know how Tesla plans to engage in these mobility services,"" said Carlson. ""Tesla is looking at mobility services companies very broadly, but we have to be careful, because that's a segment obviously that's incredibly new, with respect to the longer automotive industry's history, and it's one that changes quite frequently,"" he said.

Carlson says there are a lot of different business models to look at in this area. ""Whether it's Waymo, who doesn't quite have a business model established yet, or you're looking at someone like Uber or Lyft or car2go, there's a pretty wide set of competitors outside of the industry,"" he said.

So with Musk's history of bold claims, potential issues meeting demand for Model 3, and competition in the highly competitive race to develop fully-autonomous cars, can Tesla stay ahead of the curve?

""People love that Musk's so unbound by fear of failure that he'll just do whatever. 'Sure. I'm going to retire on Mars. Sure. I'm going to sell two million cars a year by 2025.' A lot of [Tesla supporters] know things won't actually happen the way he's saying it,"" said Ramsey.

""But if he gets 75% of the way to his crazy vision, that's a pretty amazing outcome. If he ends up selling 800,000 cars by 2025,"" said Ramsey, ""that would be crazy.""

Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them.

Most automakers test a new model’s production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don’t have gaps or seams.

Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month.

Musk’s decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.

Musk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Tesla deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker’s efforts to stop burning cash.

“He’s pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process,” said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman.

Investors are already counting on Tesla’s factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals.

There are caution signs, however. The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn’t work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs.

“It’s an experiment, certainly,” said Consumer Reports’ Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla’s previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, “or it could be they have unsuspected problems they’ll have a hard time dealing with.”

Musk discussed the decision to skip what he referred to as ""beta"" production testing during a call last month with an invited group of investors. Details were published on Reddit by an investor on the call. (here).

He also said that “advanced analytical techniques” – code word for computer simulations - would help Tesla in advancing straight to production tooling.

Tesla declined to confirm details of the call or comment on its production strategy.

The auto industry’s incumbents have not been standing still. Volkswagen AG’s Audi division launched production of a new plant in Mexico using computer simulations of production tools – and indeed the entire assembly line and factory - that Audi said it believed to be an industry first. That process allowed the plant to launch production 30 percent faster than usual, Audi said.

An Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla’s vice president of production.

MAKING TOOLS FASTER

Typically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment.

Tesla’s decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as “soft tooling” ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla’s assembly line planning.

Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former’s value negligible, the source said.

“Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things,” said the person.

In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said.

Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla’s haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion.

Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was “close to the edge” as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017.

Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) .

Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an “alien dreadnought” factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage.

But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car."

The Model S was Tesla's first ""real"" car, designed and engineered from scratch and launched in 2012, just three years after the carmaker's brush with bankruptcy.

For the first new American auto company in decades, it was a home run. It was named Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2013, and it gave Tesla two things it urgently needed back then: revenue from a vehicle selling for around $100,000 on average; and an all-electric luxury car that was rapidly adopted by the well-heeled tech crowd of Silicon Valley.

Since 2012, Tesla has steadily improved the Model S, adding all-wheel-drive (the ""dual motor"" option), better range with larger battery packs, and not incidentally supercar-beating 0-60 mph acceleration, via Ludicrous Mode. The Model S of 2017 is fast, comfortable, and technologically advanced thanks to frequent over-the-air software updates, and capable of driving itself under some circumstances thanks to Autopilot.

It's a wonderful car, but it's been overshadowed by the arrival of Tesla's play for the mass-market: the Model 3 sedan, which will eventually be available for $35,000 (the $44,000 version is being delivered now).

All about the Model 3

The Model 3 arrives. Screenshot/Tesla Tesla revealed the Model 3 in early 2016 and semi-officially launched the car this past July. Something on the order of half a million pre-orders for the vehicle have rolled in. I attended the handover at Tesla's factory in Fremont, CA, and got to drive the car for about 15 minutes. Initial impressions were better than fabulous, as I wrote at the time.

Making good on the hype has meant that the Model S has been completely overshadowed by the Model 3. This isn't really a huge positive for Tesla; the company would like to sell a lot more Model S vehicles between now and the advent of full Model 3 production, which won't arrive until mid-to-late 2018.

According to CEO Elon Musk, Tesla is organized to produce a combined 100,000 Model S and Model X SUVs annually, and the carmaker doesn't want to see that number slide, particularly on a $35,000 vehicle that likely won't throw off as much profit.

Beyond that, the frenzy around the Model 3 has made us forget just how great the Model S is. The S remains Tesla's best car, in my view, better than the somewhat gimmicky Model X, with its ""falcon wing"" doors. The design alone — the car was penned by Franz von Holzhausen, who also created the Model 3 — has held up remarkably well. The S continues to be a suave, rolling advertisement for Tesla. In the five years since its launch, the vehicle has been only lightly refreshed.

Tesla's masterpiece

Musk with the Model S. Maurizio Pesce / Wikimedia Commons In Fremont, after taking the Model 3 out for a spin, I was invited to take a couple of laps around Tesla's compact test track. The Model S P100D was our chariot. And what a chariot! Tesla has upped the interior luxury quotient considerably; it's no longer possible to knock the S for having the price tag of a Mercedes S-Class and the seats of a Toyota Camry. The speed is literally neck-snapping. And for a car with a great big battery under the floorboards, it gets around the track quite niftily.

Tesla has no intention of discontinuing the Model S. As a result, the S has the opportunity to become one of those cars, a machine like the BMW 3- or 5-Series, or from an earlier era, the Lincoln Continental or Ford Mustang — a car that endures and mints new fans over successive generations. The Model S is also built to last. Two examples have rolled over 250,000 and 300,000 miles, and they're still going strong.

As versatile as an SUV, able to haul around as many as seven passengers (with a pair of optional jump seats), the Model S is a sedan and therefore not as traditionally collectible as a sexy sports car. But there's no denying its historical significance: it is without question the best and most important electric car ever made. It also transcends its powertrain. Simply as a car, it's marvelous.

As we prepare to see the highways and byways of the USA plastered in Model 3's, let's not forget the incredible Model S, Tesla's flagship vehicle."
https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15827652/2016-tesla-model-s-17-inch-tablet-electric-vehicle-screendrive-review,pos,1.0,4.057070250810951e-30,ScreenDrive: Tesla Model S is the epitome of a tablet on wheels,2017-06-19 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:18:57.487359,Jun,"Cars have become expensive, rolling gadgets that are full of screens, speakers, and sensors — but are they actually good gadgets? In our new series, ScreenDrive, we'll review cars just like any other device, starting with the basics of what they’re like to use.

The Tesla Model S embodies the whole “rolling tablet” concept more than any other car I’ve driven. That’s because the Model S dashboard is literally built around a giant, 17-inch tablet, one that communicates the core functions of the car and will feel intuitive to a generation of tablet users who are used to taps, swipes, and pinches. Unlike Ford and Honda and BMW and every other legacy carmaker, Tesla came into existence at a time when this kind of in-car technology was foundational, not evolving. So from the perspective of ScreenDrive, Tesla has had that distinct advantage in its tech underpinnings.

When I first saw a Tesla Model S in a mall showroom back in 2012, my initial thought was that such a massive interactive display would inevitably be a distraction while driving. After now having driven a Model S on multiple occasions, I still think there are elements of it that could be smarter or more intuitive. But overall I’ve enjoyed the in-car Tesla experience much more than I expected to — and I think it’s less distracting than a lot of other modern car interfaces. Its size ends up being beneficial in a lot of ways: maps are highly visible, apps are easy to swipe through, and the rear camera view is ginormous.

PACKAGES

For the purpose of this review Tesla loaned me a late-2016 Model S P100D. This is the top-of-the-line, best-of-the-best, impress-your-friends Model S you can get right now. (At one point I described it ineloquently to a co-worker as a “beast.”) It’s a sleek, all-electric sedan with a range of 315 miles per charge. But its looks are deceptive: it’s torque-y as hell, and ridiculously fun to drive (again with the eloquence). Its base price is $134,500, and it creeps up to $167,500 for a model with rear-facing seats.

This is the top-of-the-line, best-of-the-best, impress-your-friends Model S

For that kind of price tag, I’d expect little things like a nicer rearview mirror, better cup holders, and better fit and finish on the front hood. But you’re clearly paying for the power and the autonomous driving features, not the accents.

CONTROLS

The instrumentation inside the car isn’t relegated to the giant touchscreen. There are a few physical buttons as well, predominantly on the steering wheel. These are intuitive and easy to use.

On the left-hand side of the steering wheel there’s a scroll wheel for volume control, along with forward and back buttons for media. On the right-hand side, there’s another scroll button that controls a list of menu items on the behind-the-wheel display, including your contacts, recent calls, display brightness, fan speed, temperature, and more. Above that is the all-important voice command button, which I cover in more detail below.

DISPLAYS

The information shown on the display directly behind the wheel is easy to interpret; there are no complicated dials or gauges. The speedometer is in big, bold numerals. Below that is a digital representation of your own car, and, as you’re passing other cars on the road, shadowy replicas of the other vehicles around you. If you’re listening to music, that info will show on the left side of the speedometer; if you’re using maps, your next upcoming turn will be displayed instead. The right side of the display corresponds with the right scroll button on the steering wheel, showing you contacts and recent phone calls and so on. And on the lower left there’s a small battery icon.

The 17-inch tablet ended up being much less distracting than I thought it would be

Then there’s the main event, the nucleus of the multimedia system: the 17-inch tablet, with a behemoth 1920 x 1200 resolution LCD display. It runs on Linux, with Tesla custom software and apps built on top of it, and it’s powered by a Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor. It’s a touchscreen display, and in my experience it was very responsive, with no notable lags or latency.

This is where you can find everything from media to maps to calendars to a web browser. For this review, I’m focusing mostly on media, maps, and voice command. The web browser is useful in theory, but video streaming is disabled and I didn’t use it for much more than to look up restaurants (which also meant pulling over, due to the attention it requires). There’s a host of other fun stuff you can dive into on the tablet — including advanced driving settings and your driving efficiency, which is expressed in watt hours per mile —but I imagine a lot of this will only appeal to true driving enthusiasts.

One quick note: all of these applications can be viewed in either full-screen or dual-view, with a virtual button that lets you switch the positioning of the two apps you’ve selected. This “swap” button is small — a little too small for me. The best workaround is to tap another icon at the top of the screen and drag it to the position you want.

Tesla has created its own maps software for its cars, but it’s built on top of Google Maps data. It loaded directions quickly, was easy to see, and gave real-time traffic updates and suggestions based on available time-saving routes. You can search easily for points of interest, and get a list of nearby Tesla battery-charging stations just by tapping on a red bolt icon.

Overall I was impressed with the maps, but it’s worth noting that the maps experience will be slightly limited without access to Wi-Fi or an LTE signal. If the Tesla loses access to a data connection, you can search for a new address and load static maps for destinations you’ve previously visited, but you can’t search for points of interest or get real-time traffic updates. On the upside: the Model S receives software updates over the air, which means the built-in maps are updated that way, too — unlike other vehicles that might require you to load new maps on the car via DVD, USB, or an SD card. These software updates appear as release notes in the car’s “About” page, just like a computer or smartphone.

The media options were okay, but not quite as impressive as the maps. The Model S comes with a complimentary four-year Slacker music subscription, which is the equivalent of the Slacker Plus subscription. This is fine for passive listening, even if you’re not a big Slacker user. The same goes for TuneIn internet radio, which also runs natively on the display. But this tier of Slacker seems to have its limitations: you can’t, for example, play a Slacker song on demand more than once, or use the back button to go back in a playlist.

Most people will want to pair their smartphone to the car via Bluetooth, which is a fine enough solution. But, like the last car I reviewed, you won’t be able to see your app-specific playlists in the media section of the display, only whatever song or podcast you’re playing at the moment. I experienced a small issue that has been noted by others before: when playing certain media, like a Recode podcast, the image that appeared as the album art didn’t match what I was actually listening to. Tesla says that this inconsistent album art is caused by a “Bluetooth limitation.”

The best part of the media experience in the Model S is really just how fast everything happens: how quickly your phone or a new phone pairs to the car, or how fast a song or artist comes up when you use voice command. And because of the giant display, I had no problem seeing whatever media was playing at the time (plus there’s the redundancy of the media in the display behind the wheel), even if I couldn’t see or control full playlists that were streaming from my smartphone.

VOICE CONTROL

Voice command was probably the least advanced aspect of the car’s multimedia system. Despite how fallible they can be, I think Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay do a better job, thanks to access to an internet-connected assistant and the ability to interpret questions asked in natural language. The Model S responded quickly to my voice commands, but I had to use very specific terms, like “Play Chris Cornell,” or “Navigate to 100 Main Street.” I sometimes slipped up and said “Directions to,” which only showed a question mark in response.

You can’t use voice command to respond to text messages. And you can’t ask questions like, “Are the San Francisco Giants playing today?” or “Who is Elon Musk?” You can, for what it’s worth, access Siri over Bluetooth by saying “Hey Siri” to your phone, and the other audio functions in the car will mute while you communicate with Siri. But there’s no direct integration in the car’s voice button. There is a web browser on the 17-inch tablet that you will likely never use, and yet the voice control in the car is not connected to the internet. It’s an interesting paradox.

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE FEATURES

Maybe the best expression of Tesla Model S as a car for tech geeks is the fact that there are Easter eggs buried in the software. These are little surprises that you can dig up if you’re willing to experiment with the interface (or really, at this point, if you just Google them).

For example, if you pull back on the control stalk for Autopilot mode four times in quick succession, the virtual road in front of you takes on the look of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart and Christopher Walken’s voice fills the Model S, along with the sound of cowbells. I am not kidding. At the risk of undermining my credibility as a car reviewer: no, I didn’t drive it in “Ludicrous” mode, another Easter egg that shoots the car to 60 mph in around two and a half seconds. I was more focused on the multimedia inside the car. But I regret not trying this Easter egg, and I promise to try it sometime. For our readers, you know.

There’s a mobile app for Teslas, too. And since both the car and the app are connected to the cloud, the mobile app gives real-time updates regardless of proximity to the vehicle itself. This is not uncommon in cars now: every auto brand from Chevy to Ford to BMW to Mercedes-Benz to Hyundai has some type of application you can check outside of the car.

The Easter eggs buried in the software of the Tesla Model S underscore that it’s a car for tech geeks

But the Tesla app gives you a mobile window into one of the more (most) critical aspects of the car: the battery life. You can see how depleted the battery is, know when it’s charging, and get alerts when it’s done charging. The mobile app also has a remote unlock feature. Also, in a nod to the luxury lifestyle Tesla represents, there’s a “valet” feature in both the car and the mobile app that limits the speed of the car, locks the glove box, and prevents temporary drivers from seeing your home and work locations in maps.

CHARGING

I never experienced battery range anxiety with the Model S, but I also happen to live within 15 miles of two Tesla Supercharging stations, so I was able to plan accordingly. When I tapped on the red bolt icon, a list of local charging stations appeared immediately.

My first Supercharging experience was in the parking lot of the Computer History Museum, not far from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. The whole charging process took less than an hour — so brief that I didn’t plan my time well and began to incur “idling” fees, which I was informed of on my iPhone. It was one of those futuristic, convergent moments of tech on tech on tech that’s totally worthy of parody on HBO’s Silicon Valley. I felt mildly ridiculous. But it was also indicative of where cars are going. In a lot ways, Tesla is already there.

That’s not to say that a 17-inch tablet is the way of the future and that all carmakers should adopt this as their in-car infotainment system. The future may hold a whole host of other innovations that radically change our in-car experiences, whether it’s super intelligent voice command, gesture-based controls, or even fully autonomous cars outfitted like living rooms. But Tesla’s approach is the most realized vision of the future we have right now.

Unexpected manufacturing problems and the sudden emergence of competition is leading Tesla backers to reassess whether the Silicon Valley automaker's head start on long-range electric cars is fading.

After Tesla's second-quarter production faltered and Volvo announced plans to switch to electric vehicles and hybrids, Tesla investors were shaken. The company's stock lost more than 16% over a three-day span last week.

Taken together, the developments illustrate the volatility of the budding world of electric vehicles and questions regarding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ability to conquer the market.

""I don’t think there should be any shock that there’s increasing competition in the electric and hybrid electric field,"" said Efraim Levy, a CFRA Research analyst who tracks Tesla. ""All the major companies are announcing that they're making that shift.""

Here are four key threats to Tesla:

•Luxury automotive brands. Tesla's Model S sedan and Model X crossover remain essentially alone in the market for ultraluxury electric vehicles with price tags sometimes topping $100,000.

But that will change.

Tesla stock suffers as Volvo takes aim, heating up electric car race

Volvo ditching gasoline engines for electric, hybrid cars after 2019

Volkswagen Group, the world's largest automaker by sales volume, is aiming squarely at Tesla.

The company's Porsche brand is planning a 600-horsepower electric sports car dubbed the Mission E, which generated buzz among auto enthusiasts for its sleek design when it was revealed in late 2015.

Meanwhile, VW's luxury Audi lineup is planning the Audi e-tron quattro luxury electric crossover concept.

Other luxury brands, including Mercedes and BMW, are expected to hatch similar models.

•Mainstream models. General Motors stunned the auto industry by beating Tesla to the market with an affordable, long-range electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt.

The Bolt starts at about $30,000 after tax credits, not much more than Tesla's new Model 3 sedan, which begins production this month. And the Bolt gets better range: about 238 miles on a battery charge, compared to the Model 3's 215.

Chevy lacks the pizzazz associated with the Tesla brand, Levy said.

""But they're there first,"" Levy said. ""There's going to be more choices and more competition.""

•Manufacturing challenges. Tesla concerned investors with last Monday's announcement that it faced ""severe"" shortfalls in supply of high-range batteries during the second quarter. That caused the company to miss its sales goals for the quarter.

While Tesla said the supply problems had been resolved, the episode underscores the difficulty in manufacturing one of the most complex consumer products on the planet. The world's major automakers simply have more experience at it, potentially giving them an edge when production ramps up.

""That’s something their competitors have much more experience in,"" Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell said.

Tesla has a significant advantage with its new battery factory in Nevada, which Musk believes will deliver major cost reductions that will give the company a competitive edge.

But other major automakers have ""scale advantages"" with their worldwide operations that ""likely means that the cost-per-vehicle advantage will not be meaningful,"" Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to investors.

Tesla is ""a very tough competitor we are respecting a lot,"" Volvo global CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in a press conference. ""With this decision, we are really becoming the second premium carmaker of the world which will also be electrified.""

•Questions about demand. Tesla received about 400,000 refundable deposits for the Model 3, but serious questions remain about the long-term demand for its vehicles.

""Tesla’s in a unique position where they have hundreds of thousands of orders they have to fill,"" Caldwell said. ""But after that, how much demand is there? I'm not really sure yet.""

There's already evidence that ""demand is plateauing"" for the Model S and Model X, Johnson said.

Seemingly anticipating the demand issues, Musk has already announced plans for a new mass-market crossover vehicle and has signaled he's considering a pickup truck.

A Tesla spokesperson was not available to comment.

The automaker says it expects to complete production of “SN1” (or “Serial Number one”) of the Model 3, its first electric car for the masses. But the Model 3 isn’t just any car. Everything for the success of Tesla as a viable car company has been building up to this point. The Model 3 will define the future of the company — and the stakes for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk couldn’t possibly be higher.

Earlier this week, Musk tweeted that Friday was the day the first Model 3 would be rolling off the assembly line. In subsequent tweets, he added that the first 30 Model 3 customers will receive their new Teslas on July 28th at a handover party hosted by the automaker.

Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017

“I think I can say, without irony of mawkishness, that this is the most important electric car ever produced,” said Michael Ramsey, research director at Gartner. “That’s because if it meets expectations of hundreds of thousands of sales, it changes the global landscape for electric cars. And if it fails, it relegates the move toward electrification to the trudging march that it has been so far.”

“I think I can say, without irony of mawkishness, that this is the most important electric car ever produced.”

Skepticism about Tesla’s ability to meet the enormous demands of mass production is extremely high. Practically no one believes Musk will be able to meet the benchmarks he has set for the Model 3. Tesla’s share price has been savaged over the last week, losing nearly 20 percent of its value, while Wall Street analysts predict that demand for Tesla’s two other current vehicles, the Model S and Model X, has already peaked. Other experts say that Musk will need to reduce costs by as much as 60 percent if it wants the Model 3 to be profitable.

And then there’s the fact that most auto startups throughout the 20th century eventually failed and fell into obscurity. Tesla, a 15-year-old company, could be poised to challenge those odds. The manufacturing and quality challenges of starting a brand-new automotive company are titanic.

“The Model 3 is critical for Tesla's long-term viability,” said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book. “The company had been around for almost 15 years yet has never turned a profit. The Model 3 will be Tesla's first attempt at a high-volume car meant for mainstream consumers. If Tesla can satisfy the Model 3's pent-up demand with a dependable and profitable vehicle it will finally justify a stock value that has it rivaling GM in capital value. If it can't, Tesla will confirm many critic's suspicions that it's never had a truly sustainable business model.”

Tesla’s sky-high valuation — it recently surpassed BMW’s market cap — depends largely on Musk’s ability to sell his vision of sustainable, battery-powered driving to a much broader population. The Model S and Model X are both extremely expensive. Even with tax incentives, both cars easily push $100,000. The Model 3 will start at $35,000, making it the cheapest in Tesla’s range. In order for Tesla to sell 10 times as many cars as it does now, it needs a much cheaper automobile.

But the marketplace for affordable electric vehicles is suddenly much more crowded than it was when the Model 3 was first announced in 2016. GM was able to grab first-mover status when it released the Chevy Bolt, a $36,620, 238-mile-per-charge, electric vehicle, last December. Other midlevel electric vehicles include the Volkswagen e-Golf ($36,415), Ford Focus Electric ($29,995), and Nissan Leaf ($37,675).

These companies have the infrastructure in place to maintain quality and dealer service networks, however. There are signs that Tesla is rethinking its approach to selling and maintaining cars. (Most car dealers now act as the service arm for new buyers.)

Tesla can’t survive on its buzz-worthiness alone, but it’s certainly helped buoy its stock price. The number of people who plunked down the $1,000 deposit to preorder the Model 3 after it was first announced last year blew away pretty much everyone’s expectations. It took less than a week for the company to receive 350,000 preorders, leading Tesla to claim the Model 3 had the “biggest one-week launch of any product ever.” Eat your heart out, Apple.

But Tesla still has a long way to go before it can stick the landing. Musk says production is expected to grow exponentially: 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 by September, and then 20,000 per month by December. If the company fails to hit these marks or runs into manufacturing issues that happen at higher scales, or demand for the Model 3 drops, analysts argue it would be a setback not just for Tesla, but perhaps the entire electrification movement.

by 2040, analysts say that 54 percent of all cars sold on the planet will be electric

In 2016, Bloomberg’s new energy think tank predicted that electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles would make up about 35 percent of the world's auto market by the year 2040. This year, the group upped that figure considerably: by 2040, analysts now say that 54 percent of all cars sold on the planet will be electric. France’s environmental minister said yesterday his country would ban the sale of all fossil fuel-burning vehicles by 2040. And Volvo said it would stop selling gas-only cars by 2019.

The world is trending toward battery-powered, electric vehicles, thanks in no small part to Musk’s vision and ingenuity. Tesla has helped spur the biggest automakers to accelerate their electrification plans. “The Chevy Bolt might not exist now were it not for Tesla,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant. “VW Group is running as fast as it can to move from diesel to electric.”

But the timing of the Model 3’s release could spell doom for Tesla, which still sells a fraction of the automobiles produced by the world’s biggest OEMs. Auto sales are stagnant in the US, while most consumers are trending toward SUVs and crossover vehicles rather than sedans. Tesla faces the problem of introducing a compact sedan when the market is running headlong away from this form factor to sport utilities. “Their timing couldn’t have been worse,” Abuelsamid said."

The founder and CEO tweeted pictures of the new vehicle, which he only got because the actual first pre-order customer gifted Musk his place in the queue as a birthday present.

Alongside the pics, Musk tweeted an interesting bit of trivia about who gets dibs on the first edition of any new Tesla car: It’s the first person who pays full price for the vehicle. Musk earned that honor for the Roadster and Model X, but not for the Model S, he noted.

This first production Model 3 is black, a good callback to the original Model T from Ford, which famously came in any color you wanted as long as it was black. The Model 3 will have more paint options, but it’s one of the very few things customers will be able to customize on the vehicle, as Tesla is limiting options early to ease the production process.

As expected based on prototype models and early spy shots of the car, it basically looks like a shorter Model S, but with a similar sporty feel for a four-door sedan. Musk’s big reveal didn’t go long on technical details, however, so we’re still waiting on some of that info, including the exact range beyond the minimum 215 mile spec, for example.

Tesla noted recently that its first customers beyond Musk can expect deliveries to start around July 28, so that’s the date to look for more info.

Bonus: here is another new photo of the Model 3.

Elon Musk revealed Tesla’s Model 3 is unlocked by a smartphone and doesn’t have a traditional key or fob among a host of other details at the delivery event for the first 30 mass-market electric cars over the weekend.



As the Model 3 enters what Musk called “six months of manufacturing hell” as Tesla ramps up production to meet the more than 500,000 pre-orders, one of the most surprising titbits is that there is no traditional key to open and start Tesla’s mass-market electric car hope.

Instead, would-be buyers of the $35,000-plus five-seat electric car will have to unlock the car with their smartphones over Bluetooth. The car will detect the owner’s smartphone – almost all modern smartphones made in the last three years supports Bluetooth – and automatically unlock, ready to start and go.

Should the battery on your phone run flat, which is a very real possibility in the days of increased use for everything from music, cameras and now keys, Tesla has a backup in the form of an NFC key card that is apparently thin enough to store in a wallet.

Press the card against the car’s B-pillar to unlock it and place it between the seats on a special spot to be able to start the car. It’s designed for valet use, but should be good to get into the car and at least charge your phone so you can properly unlock the Model 3 and go.

But the key-less design wasn’t the only thing we learned over the weekend …

1. Two battery versions

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The minimalist interior of the Model 3. Photograph: Reuters

The Model 3 will come in two versions. The $35,000 base model has a battery with a 220-mile range, does 0-60mph in 5.6 seconds and has a top speed of 130mph. It can be “supercharged” to 130 miles of range in 30 minutes and charges at a rate of 30 miles per hour via a 240V, 32A home charger.

The range-extended version, which costs $44,000, will travel up to 310 miles per charge, reaches 60mph in 5.1 seconds and a top speed of 140mph. It will reach a charge of 170 miles in 30 minutes attached to a supercharger, and charges at a rate of 37 miles per hour with a 240V, 40A home charger.

The more expensive Model 3 with the longer range is currently being produced, with the cheaper version to be produced at a later date. A high-performance version of the Model 3 will also be available sometime in the middle of next year, according to Musk.

2. There are no instruments, just a 15in touchscreen in the middle

There’s no speedometer, battery gauge or anything else directly in front of the driver. Instead there’s a large, 15in touchscreen in the middle of the dash, which displays a virtual instrument cluster along with mapping, entertainment and cabin controls.

The Model S has a 17in touchscreen in the middle of the dash, but it is in mounted in a portrait orientation compared to the Model 3’s landscape orientation.

3. There’s a luxury pack option

All Model 3s come with navigation, 4G and wifi connectivity, voice controls, a reversing camera, dual-zone climate control and two USB ports in the front for keeping that phone-come-key charged.

But Tesla offers a $5,000 “Premium Upgrade Package” that adds upgraded cabin materials such as wood, heated seats, power adjusted seats and steering column, a tinted glass roof, heated and power-folding wing mirrors, LED fog lights, a subwoofer and upgraded audio, plus two more USB ports in the rear.

With four USB ports and a battery the size of a car, the Model 3 could be the biggest backup smartphone charger ever produced.

4. Enhanced Autopilot

The Model 3 has a comes with a range of sensors to enable the next version of Tesla’s driving assistance system dubbed Enhanced Autopilot. These include one forward-facing radar sensor, seven cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors and new, more powerful Nvidia Drive PX2 processor.

To enable Enhanced Autopilot, owners will have to buy a $5,000 upgrade, enabling traffic speed matching, lane guidance, automatic lane switching and self-parking abilities, including Tesla’s “summon”, which has the car drive out of a parking space or garage to your side by itself.

5. Full self-driving

Tesla is in the process of developing a fully autonomous system for its cars, which uses the equipment from the Enhanced Autopilot system. While the system isn’t ready, and won’t be legal to use in the UK and US until the appropriate legislation is passed, an upgrade to fully autonomous driving will cost just $3,000 on top of the Enhanced Autopilot upgrade.

6. Black as standard

The Model 3 comes in black, but if you want it in metallic silver, blue, a slate grey (midnight silver), white or red, it’ll cost $1,000 more. The car comes with 18in alloys as standard, but 19in sport alloys can be added for $1,500 more.

7. You can sleep in it

The rear seats fold down in a traditional 60/40 split, and apparently there’s a subculture of Model S users who camp in the back of their cars. Bloomberg found there’s enough room in the back of the Model 3 for someone 206cm (6ft 9in) tall to sleep flat along the car with the seats folded."

The Model 3 starts at $35,000 -- much cheaper than Tesla's previous offerings, which approached or could exceed $100,000.

But prepare to blow past its advertised price tag if you want the car's most eye-catching features.

Want a color other than black? Add another $1,000. What about the 19-inch sports wheels? That's $1,500 extra.

Other Model 3 add-ons are even pricier. The Tesla name might conjure images of self-driving futuristic cars for a lot of fans. But if you want your Model 3 to include those features, you'll have to fork over even more cash.

The car's ""Enhanced Autopilot,"" which allows the Model 3 to automatically keep pace with traffic, change lanes and self-park, is an extra $5,000. A car equipped with ""full self-driving capability"" is another $3,000 on top of that.

(Note that the self-driving software isn't ready yet. But cars equipped with the feature can use it when it is released.)

The battery that comes with the base model will let you drive 220 miles when charged. If you want to travel longer distances, that will also cost extra: A $9,000 battery upgrade gives the car a 310-mile range.

All 30 of the first Model 3s delivered Friday came with that upgrade.

Critics this weekend gushed about their experience driving Tesla's new car. But some were driving souped-up vehicles that far exceeded the base price.

Motor Trend's testing director, Kim Reynolds, got to take a Model 3 owned by Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's lead car designer, for a spin on the open road Saturday. (Most test drivers were confined to a Tesla-sanctioned course.)

""Have I ever driven a more startling small sedan? I haven't,"" Reynolds wrote.

But he pointed out that the cherry red sedan was significantly more pricey than the base Model 3 price. Reynolds estimated it cost $59,500 before tax incentives.

Von Holzhausen had opted for a ""premium package."" The $5,000 upgrade equipped his car with higher-grade materials, a panoramic sunroof, an upgraded sound system, heated seats and cordless phone charging, according to Renyolds.

That car also had the $1,500 19-inch sports wheels instead of the standard 18-inch. And of course, the red paint job cost another $1,000.

Mashable's Lance Ulanoff praised the car as ""how all cars should feel."" He drove a $44,000 version that came with the 310-mile range battery and could go from 0 to 60 miles-per-hour in 5.1 seconds.

The cheapest Model 3 still comes with several snazzy features, according to Tesla's spec sheet.

All drivers get a 15-inch touch screen display instead of the clustered dash board gauges that are standard on other cars.

The budget version also comes with a navigation system, voice-activated controls, LTE and wi-fi connection, keyless entry, rear-view cameras and emergency braking. They also have a top speed of 130 miles per hour.

Some Model 3 buyers will get to take advantage of a U.S. government incentive credit that knocked $7,500 off the total cost.

But that credit is only good on the first 200,000 vehicles Tesla sells. That means not everyone who orders a Model 3 will enjoy a rebate -- more than half a million people have already reserved the car.

Tesla plans to produce several thousand more Model 3s this year. But customers pre-ordering the car today will have to wait until late 2018 to receive their vehicle.

Morris,"Last week saw the delivery of the first 30 Tesla Model 3s to eager customers, as well as the first chance for many journalists and reviewers to get hands-on with the cars. There were at least three big questions ahead of the Model 3’s debut:

Does it feel like a Tesla? In other words, has the company figured out how to make something that, when you’re sitting in it, feels as special as a Model S, for a much lower price tag?

Is the weird instrument display—a single, center-mounted flat screen instead of gauges above the steering wheel—actually going to work for drivers?

And most importantly . . . is it fast?

While full reviews will have to wait, early test-drives show that the answer to those questions is yes—mostly.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Motor Trend, in a full-throated tribute, called the Model 3 “the most important vehicle of the century.” Reviewer Kim Reynolds describes the car’s “gush of torque” and “scalpel-like” handling, suggesting that the advantages of electric engines over gas have translated to the lower-priced vehicle. Of the display, Reynolds said “It’ll take a lot more miles than this to decide if the single off-center screen completely substitutes for a conventionally located gauge cluster, but I’m already adapting to it.”

Our own Kirsten Korosec praised the subtle refinement of interior, including hidden air conditioning vents and the car’s vast sense of space, thanks in part to its glass roof.

Mashable’s Lance Ulanoff gushed at the “wonderful” upholstery material of Tesla’s own design, while calling the nontraditional instrument array “disconcerting.” He also noted the responsiveness that comes, in part, from the car’s battery-anchored low center of gravity.

The Verge’s Tamara Warren felt a “glee factor” when driving the car—and noted that yes, it has a cup holder.

Based on a much shorter ride, the Washington Post’s Peter Holley described the sense of entering “uncharted territory,” saying the minimalist interior feels the way a car based on contemporary technology should. Holley found the off-center instrument display to be “safer and more intuitive” than a traditional layout.

Wired, while echoing most of the broader praise, also highlighted a marketing pitfall that Tesla hasn’t yet convincingly avoided. “If you’ve lusted after that expensive Model S,” reviewer Jack Stewart writes, “you’ll likely be satisfied with the Model 3 too.” Despite warnings from Elon Musk himself, some high-end buyers could make exactly that decision, cannibalizing Model S sales.

Most of these impressions, it should be noted, were based on upgraded versions of the Model 3, with real-world prices from $44,000 up to about $59,500. The bare-bones $35,000 Model 3 will, not surprisingly, have a little less range, a little less acceleration, and fewer features. There’s also plenty of uncertainty about build quality and reliability as Tesla spins up to produce a half million preordered Model 3s as quickly as it can.

Such issues may have been foreshadowed in the experience of a Wall Street Journal reporter, whose test drive included hiccups that may have been software glitches or, as Tesla later claimed, driver error.

Nonetheless, the consensus seems to be in—this is the car of the future, and everyone else just has to catch up."

The company handed over the key (cards) to the first 30 owners of the much-anticipated car at a glitzy launch event on July 29.

What’s the word so far?

It’s hard to find a bad review.

So far, no country outside of China is buying electric vehicles in large numbers. But Tesla plans to change that, manufacturing 400,000 of the cars per year by 2018. To sell those, car buyers will need to see the Model 3 not just as a different type of car, but as a better one. The biggest competition for the Model 3 is not other electric vehicles; it’s gasoline engines.

The early word from reviewers looks promising for Tesla. Their verdict: the Model 3 is not only impressive by electric vehicle standards, it’s a spectacular car by any measure. Any qualms tend to focus on a slight learning curve for dashboard controls, limited fast-charging infrastructure, and the cost for some of the premium features. No doubt issues will arise, but this is Tesla’s honeymoon.

Quartz rounded up the (sometimes breathless) highlights from the major reviewers about the new car.

It’s best in class (and maybe just the best)

The Model 3 feels like an automotive tipping point, writes Wired’s Jack Stewart. Tesla’s debut could mark the point at which almost anyone—not just Tesla fans and the environmentally conscious—could see themselves driving an electric vehicle.

The standard $35,000 Model 3 (before tax incentives) has a 220-mile range, five-seats, and can hit 131 miles per hour for a price equivalent to the median US car price. The more powerful $44,000 long-range version can travel 310 miles on a single charge. At that price, Engadget’s Andrew Tarantola writes, ”the Model 3 really feels like the car that will bring electric vehicles as a whole into the mainstream.”

Motor Trend showered the Model 3 with superlative praise. “The Tesla Model 3 is […] the most important vehicle of the century,” the magazine writes. “Yes, the hyperbole is necessary,” it continues, likening the Alfa Romeo Giulia X’s performance to a “wet sponge” compared to the Model 3.

Business Insider also did not hold back. ”I’ve driven pretty much every other all-electric car you can buy, and I can safely say that the Model 3 has no competition,” wrote Matthew Debord. “There isn’t anybody who’s going to sit in the driver’s seat of this car and not want it, if only briefly. The Model 3 stokes immediate desire, and the lust lingers.”

Fast, nimble, and wow

“The car sprints like an Olympic 100-meter champion,” raves USA Today. The $35,000 standard version hits 60 mph in 5.6 seconds with a top speed of 130mph (the upgraded version is slightly faster). The Model 3 has a smaller battery pack so it can’t perform the same theatrics as its premium cousins (an extra fast “Ludicrous” mode).

But that didn’t seem to faze reviewers. High-torque electric propulsion means the Model 3 still has a significant acceleration advantage over internal combustion engines. Tesla’s engineers also apparently took advantage of the car’s low center of gravity (the battery pack fits neatly under the chassis) to give it crisp handling. “The Model 3 is so unexpected[ly] scalpel-like, I’m sputtering for adjectives,” sputters Motor Trend.

Autopilot is awesome

The Model 3 comes with the same eight cameras, radar, ultrasonics, and plenty of computing power that the premium Model X and S offer. Although it costs more to activate Autopilot and advanced self-driving features, the car already has the ability to take over highway driving and other chores for drivers.

Testing the semi-autonomous Autopilot, TopGear’s Charlie Turner called it “a system that still feels like witchcraft.” In what is likely to become a standard feature in many cars, the gear shifter has an extra setting: Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive— and Autopilot.

So much interior

Tesla says it designed the interior of the car for the day when cars will drive themselves, and there’s no need for myriads buttons and displays. Appropriately, the Model 3 exterior feels “like a cockpit from the future,” says Mashable. The challenge was to provide expansive interior space, even as it shrunk the car compared to the Model S. “Subjectively it succeeded,” judges Motor Trend.

Tesla replaced the typical automotive dashboard with a “stylish, Scandinavian” touchscreen console, a horizontal 15-inch display that gives drivers all the information they need. Few buttons exist besides some thumb controls on the steering wheel. Multiple storage areas are tucked into the front of the car, as well as two smartphone charging docks. The individual vents for hot or cold air are replaced by thin openings in the dash blowing air into the cabin, and controlled by touching the screen and swiping where more AC or heat is desired.

A little pricey, but still a good deal

Tesla delivered on its promise to deliver a base Model 3 at $35,000 (or just $27,500 after federal tax incentives) with enough style to please most Tesla aficionados. “It’s clear the Model 3 has inherited a lot of its family DNA from those machines while cutting back on enough bells and whistles to bring the starting price down to $35,000,” writes USA Today.

If owners want more splash, it will add up. An enhanced Autopilot costs $5,000, while a future release of “Full Self-Driving Capability” will cost $3,000 sometime in the future. Adding in all the extras such as larger battery pack, bigger tires, custom paint colors, full-glass reward windshield and other amenities would cost $59,500 pre-incentives.

But for those willing to splurge, writes Business Insider, the Model 3 “is going to blow many, many minds. This is easily the most attractive entry-level luxury, all-electric car on the market.”"

It relates to the world's largest car market — China — where competition between Elon Musk's electric-car company and local Chinese EV makers is poised to accelerate. Tesla shares have moved this month on reports of production hiccups — even allegations it has resorted to making cars by hand — and when it was reported last Thursday that Consumer Reports will give only the Model 3 an ""average "" rating. But it's Monday's report that Tesla may become the first foreign automaker to produce in mainland China without a local joint venture partner — and a recent major change in the way the Chinese government will provide support for the electric-vehicle industry — that could really make or break the stock in the long term. Reports over the weekend indicated that Tesla was close to finalizing a deal to produce in a free-trade zone in Shanghai. This would allow Tesla to keep its intellectual property secret but might force it to pay steep tariffs if it is not granted a special exemption — essentially, treating the cars as imports. Tesla had previously said it hoped to identify a production site in China by the end of the year.

The reported deal comes as China is implementing new incentives for EV adoption to replace expiring subsidies and push automakers onto more aggressive EV investment and production schedules. ""This will be the strictest and biggest EV plan worldwide, integrating European and California's EV policy together, and will give strong momentum for China's EV development,"" said Jiayin Song, a Beijing-based senior associate at U.S.-based Rocky Mountain Institute, which helped China devise its long-term climate change strategy. It will be the new driver for EV development after the Chinese government gradually shrinks the size of fiscal subsidies for new energy vehicles. As the bulls and bears (22 percent of Tesla's public float were short the stock as of Oct. 10) fight over whether cash burn and production challenges can justify Tesla shares that are up more than 60 percent this year, the big moves by the Chinese government have to be weighed by investors. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire investor, told CNBC on Monday that he wouldn't buy Tesla shares right now even though it is clear to him that demand for oil will diminish as ""all other companies are going into the Tesla path of electric cars and even autonomous cars."" He said, ""Maybe some people believe the value is right. It's not for me to enter [at] that price. It's too exuberant for me right now."" The China EV market is somewhat of a double-edged sword for Tesla: The Chinese EV plan is a big endorsement of everything Tesla stands for at a time when the Trump administration is leaning more toward dialing back fuel efficiency standards in the United States. It's a chance to gain even more sales in China, where Tesla has been growing quickly. But Chinese government-subsidized local electric-car makers also are rapidly advancing. The major global auto companies — including Ford and GM — will also push further into the Chinese market and EVs as the government clarifies its support for these efforts.

Sometimes people are under the impression that China is either dragging their feet or somehow behind the U.S. in terms of sustainable energy promotion, but they are by far the most aggressive on Earth. It's crazy. Elon Musk speaking to a meeting of U.S. governors during the summer

Through the first half of 2017, Tesla sales in China were just under $1 billion, versus $2.8 billion in the United States. Year over year that represented a significant increase: In 2016's first half, sales in China were $252 million vs. $1.5 billion in the United States, according to a Tesla regulatory filing. That's a spike from roughly 16 percent of sales to 35 percent. In 2016, Tesla eclipsed the $1 billion mark in China in annual sales for the first time. Musk said this summer at the National Governors Association meeting, ""China's environmental policies are way ahead of the U.S. Their mandate for renewable energy far exceeds the U.S. Sometimes people are under the impression that China is either dragging their feet or somehow behind the U.S. in terms of sustainable energy promotion, but they are by far the most aggressive on Earth. It's crazy. In fact, the coalition of Chinese car manufacturers just wrote the Chinese government to beg them to slow down the mandate, because it's too much. "" China's support for EVs is so ""crazy"" that implementation of the new regulations was pushed back a year to 2019 to give automakers more time; the Chinese government was originally pressing for implementation next year. While dropping subsidies risks alienating some customers of Tesla and other carmakers, the Chinese government is banking on the idea that moves such as making it easier to get coveted perks, like license plates granting drivers access to certain areas of major (polluted) cities, will be at least as much of an incentive. The new rules regulate both automakers' company-wide average fuel mileage and the percentage of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in their new car sales, Rocky Mountain Institute's Song said. It requires automakers, both domestic and global, to obtain 10 percent of credits from new-energy vehicles beginning in 2019. The rule applies to carmakers that manufacture or import more than 30,000 traditional vehicles annually. Those who fail to comply must buy credits or face fines, she said.

At least one Wall Street bull says Tesla's Chinese lead is secure

On Tuesday analysts at Piper Jaffray wrote that with Tesla's brand already established in China — especially at the highest price points — and with China pushing to have all cars powered by electricity at some point in the future, the American brand's position is relatively secure. Indeed, Piper thinks it will remain the market leader in China indefinitely. The rules will help Tesla on one level, since it makes nothing but electric cars, but are intended to spur competitors at all price points to speed up the introduction and marketing of electric vehicles. And given the size of the Chinese market, and household incomes that are much lower than in the United States, it will create room for other players and more competition for Tesla. Goldman analysts led by Tokyo-based Kota Yuzawa recently published an estimate that 8 percent of global auto sales, which today would represent almost 8 million cars and light trucks, will be all-electric by 2030. China is already the world's largest car market and biggest part of any forecast. But that puts Goldman at the bearish end of Wall Street projections: Morgan Stanley, a longtime Tesla bull, projects the same EV growth to reach 27 percent. Goldman analysts allowed for a more aggressive ""hyperadoption"" scenario to reflect the growing possibility that government incentives and lower battery costs will drive even faster EV adoption — almost twice as fast as its base case.

But Chinese EV makers have something Tesla does not: Profits

Especially in China, there's room for local Chinese competitors to undercut Tesla's price points, especially in outlying areas, even as more affluent cities let the company push ahead. That includes relative giants, like BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings, according to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs research. These companies have something Tesla doesn't: profits. Hangzhou-based Geely has been the hotter of the leading Chinese auto stocks with EV lines, riding an earnings beat for the first half of the year to see its shares more than triple in 2017. The company saw revenue more than double to RMB 18.1 billion, while profit climbed 128 percent to RMB 4.34 billion, about $660 million at current exchange rates, beating forecasts because the company managed costs better than had been expected, analysts who cover the company wrote. The company sold about 7,000 electric cars during the first half of the year, out of 621,731 total. Tesla delivered over 47,000 cars in the first half of the year. But unlike Tesla, which had a net loss of near-$700 million in the first half of the year and has chosen to absorb large losses as it attempts to scale production and grab share in the luxury-EV market, Geely is solidly profitable. The company, which also owns Swedish automaker Volvo — which recently announced all new models will be electric after 2019 — is on track to make RMB 1.06 per share this year, for a relatively earthbound price to earnings ratio of 15, according to Goldman. That's still double the P/E ratios for automakers that make lots of gasoline-powered vehicles like Ford or GM, but way below the over 70 times 2019 projected profits that Tesla commands at today's prices. Beijing Electric Vehicle, the EV division of state-owned BAIC Motor, sold 36,084 units through the first seven months of the year, according to Bloomberg."

In 2014, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company was taking an open-sourced approach to their patents, allowing anyone to use them to forward the development and adoption of electric vehicles. This month, Tesla-inspired Chinese automaker Xiaopeng Motors launched the beta version of their first all-electric SUV.

As reported by Electrek, it’s hard to know which of Tesla’s patents Xiaopeng Motors used, but its clear their first vehicle certainly shares more than a few things with the California company’s own vehicles— specifically, the Model X. Xiaopeng’s SUV uses the same 18650 battery cell format as Tesla’s SUV, albeit with Samsung li-ion cells. This results in a vehicle with less range; Xiaopeng’s 300 km (186 miles) versus the Model X’s proposed 474 km (295 miles).

Then there’s the LCD instrument display, as well as the central touchscreen located in the interior. Both of these are almost 1:1 with those found in Tesla’s vehicles. Beyond that, the Chinese automaker intends to introduce driver assist and self-driving capabilities similar to Tesla Autopilot. Interestingly enough, they recently hired Junli Gu, who worked at Tesla as the machine learning lead for Autopilot.

It seems clear that Tesla’s readily available patents are allowing others to create new electric vehicles of their own, which will allow people to familiarize themselves with the concept. As a result, electric vehicles may soon become the norm. Given that they’re needed to reduce emissions, ensure cleaner air, and cut our reliance on fossil fuels, dealing with cars that all look a bit alike may be a fair price to pay."

Elon Musk's company has reached a deal allowing it to build cars in Shanghai's free-trade zone and sell them in China, according to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

Tesla (TSLA) declined to confirm the reports, but it has said it wants to lay out its plans for producing electric cars in the world's largest auto market by the end of this year.

Here are a few of the speed bumps ahead for pioneering Silicon Valley firm:

Heavy duties

Tesla is reportedly planning to set up a wholly owned manufacturing plant in Shanghai, which would be a first for a foreign carmaker operating in China.

The arrangement would help Tesla cut labor and production costs, which is a big selling point given that its vehicles carry a 50% markup in China. But cars in the Chinese free trade zone still wouldn't escape the country's steep 25% import tariff because the plant would be in in a free trade zone.

Foreign car companies usually avoid those costly fees by forming joint ventures with local manufacturers to build cars in China. The downside is that forces them to share profits and technology with Chinese partners, an unappealing prospect for Tesla, which has closely guarded some of its innovations.

Related: Tesla misses the mark on Model 3 production by a lot

""Musk certainly will not want a joint venture, otherwise all the secrets would be known to the Chinese,"" said Li Yanwei, a Beijing-based analyst with the China Automobile Dealers Association.

But Musk has been looking for years for a way to set up production in China in order to drive down Tesla's sticker price.

""All of our sales in China are effectively at quite a high penalty, but that will be alleviated once we move to local production,"" Musk told CNN last year, adding that the Model 3 ""will eventually be made in China.""

Fierce competition

China is already the world's largest market for electric vehicles and has set ambitious targets to increase sales in the coming years.

The country has already proved lucrative for Tesla: the company reported that sales in China more than tripled last year to more than $1 billion. And it nearly reached that total in just the first six months of this year.

But it will face stiff competition from other global automakers eager to cash in on China's embrace of electric cars. Beijing is also aggressively pushing local manufacturers to make advances in the technology.

Analysts suggest Tesla's main rivals are likely to be BMW, Mercedes Benz and Audi (AUDVF), who are all launching luxury electric cars in China in the coming years. Those automakers have also already teamed up with local partners, so their vehicles won't get hit with the import tariff.

Volvo (VOLAF) and its Chinese owner Geely (GELYF) want to peel away some of Tesla's market share with Polestar, a brand they recently recast as a maker of high-performance electric cars. And international giants like Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) also plan to develop fully electric cars in China.

Unlike many of its big competitors, Tesla has low brand recognition outside top tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai, experts say.

Chinese power plays

Tesla's factory deal may save it from sharing valuable technology, but the Chinese government could still make life difficult for the company by introducing new policies favoring domestic players.

For example, officials could ask Tesla to use local batteries in order to qualify for subsidies, raising quality control issues, said KL Lo, a Hong Kong-based auto analyst with Maybank. Tesla has gone to great lengths to build its own battery supply for its U.S.-produced cars.

Government subsidies are a major incentive for electric car buyers in China. They include free or more accessible license plates, which can cost thousands of dollars for regular cars.

Li of the China Automobile Dealers Association said Shanghai would probably help Tesla by boosting the number of available license plates, if it builds its factory in the city. But the company shouldn't expect much more from officials.

""I don't think Tesla will get any special treatment from the government, as it doesn't cooperate with Chinese state companies,"" he said.

They want to achieve that by producing competitive electric cars, but also by accelerating the whole industry’s transition, which is why they open-sourced their patents.

It hasn’t been clear if any company actually took advantage of Tesla’s patents yet, but now a new Chinese startup openly references Tesla’s technology and the open-sourcing of their patents as the motivation behind the company.

Xiaopeng Motors was founded by Henry Xia back in 2014.

Xia was working in research and development for the Guangzhou Automobile Group when Tesla announced that they are opening their patents and the young engineer saw an opportunity to create a startup.

He enlisted the help of several other automotive engineers and also recruited from the internet and tech industries to create Xiaopeng.

3 years later, they launched the “beta version” of their first vehicle, the Xpeng, an all-electric SUV.

Now we can’t say exactly what Tesla patents they are using, but there’s no doubt that the company was heavily inspired by the California-based automaker.

In terms of core technology, the first obvious link is the battery pack architecture. While almost every new automaker since Tesla has used the same long and flat battery pack design fitted on the floor of the car between the two axles, Xiaopeng also copied the battery module design inside the pack.

Here’s a side-by-side of Xiaopeng’s Xpeng pack and Tesla’s Model S battery pack (Model S picture by Jason Hughes):

They are using the same 18650 battery cell format, but Xiaopeng actually uses Samsung li-ion cells unlike Tesla’s custom Panasonic cells. Tesla currently uses 18650 cells for Model S and Model X packs and 2170 cells for Model 3 packs.

The Xpeng’s battery enables ~300 km (186 miles) of range, according to the company.

Despite the similar battery pack architecture, the Xpeng is significantly less powerful than Tesla’s vehicles, but it is aims at the lower end of the SUV market than Tesla’s Model X. But the similarities between Tesla and Xiaopeng don’t end here.

Moving to the interior. Xiaopeng put a Tesla-like center touchscreen as the main control center for the vehicle. Here’s a side-by-side of Xiaopeng’s Xpeng interior and Tesla’s Model S interior:

Now the inspiration changes into straight copying when looking at the user interface of the instrument cluster.

Here’s Xiaopeng’s Xpeng instrument cluster next to Tesla’s Model S instrument cluster:

The company plans similar autonomous and assisted driving features as Tesla’s Autopilot – hence the extremely similar user interface.

They recently hired Junli Gu, Tesla’s former machine learning lead for Autopilot, to lead their autonomous driving effort.

Things have been going well for Xiaopeng while using this strategy of copying being inspired by Tesla. They recently produced the first 15 Xpeng vehicles.

Now they are raising funds to expand production at a factory in Zhengzhou.

Earlier this summer, they raised 2.2 billion RMB ($320 million USD) and they are now reportedly aiming to raise 10 billion RMB ($1.4 billion USD) to expand their annual production capacity of 100,000 vehicles.

Tesla has reportedly fired hundreds of employees amid signs that the company is off to a slow start in manufacturing its crucial Model 3 electric car.

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker and tech company dismissed several hundred workers, according to multiple reports, including an initial story by the Mercury News. Reuters also reported the news.

The dismissals occurred after what Tesla described as ""an annual performance review"" of its more than 33,000 employees. The company did not provide specifics.

But the firings reportedly included engineers, managers, salespeople and factory employees.

The move comes as Tesla is aiming to rapidly expand production of its new mass-market Model 3. CEO Elon Musk had said the company would be making 5,000 cars per week by the end of the year, but that goal appears to be in jeopardy amid early stumbles.

It was not clear whether any of the firings were connected to the manufacturing problems.

Musk acknowledged on Oct. 6 that the company was facing ""bottlenecks"" in Model 3 production. He said Tesla was ""diverting resources"" to clear up the Model 3 production challenges, which was one factor in the company's decision to delay its reveal of an electric semi-truck by about three weeks.

The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Oct. 2 that ""a handful"" of its ""manufacturing subsystems"" have ""taken longer to activate than expected.""

The news that Tesla’s market value topped that of GM this week means that for the first time in the automobile era, America’s most valuable car maker is not based in Detroit. Instead, as cars become increasingly reliant on cutting-edge software and new energy technology, a Silicon Valley-based luxury electric car maker best exemplifies this convergence of the mechanical and electronic worlds.

Tesla is not profitable yet, but its high market valuation means that Wall Street is betting that Musk can revolutionize both the automobile and energy industries with his company’s innovative approach to making electric cars. Through software upgrades, Tesla can add substantial features and improvements—such as automatic braking, partial autopilot and robotic parking—to cars that it’s already sold.

“We really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels,” Tesla’s brash billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, said while announcing software updates for the Model S in March 2015. “Tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company. A huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop.”

Innovation, of course, is nothing new for the U.S. automobile industry. More than a century ago, Henry Ford cornered the market with his ability to combine state-of-the-art auto design with an affordable price tag. The Model T, first introduced in 1908, would make automobile ownership—and the freedom that came with it—available to the masses for the first time. The techniques of mass production that made this possible would soon become standard for the industry, even as the Great Depression wiped out smaller carmakers and left only the Big Three (Ford, General Motors and Chrysler) standing.

By that time, however, a new innovator had taken the stage. Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM’s leader in the 1920s and ‘30s, capitalized on the fact that many early car owners had become dissatisfied with their vehicles and started to look for larger, more stylish models that rode more smoothly. (Despite its groundbreaking status, and the subsequent improvements in automotive technology, Ford’s Model T remained relatively unchanged by the mid-‘20s.)

Sloan’s GM put an emphasis on regularly producing a wide variety of stylish car models as a way of enticing people to purchase new cars more frequently. His innovative strategy was one of planned obsolescence, or making customers dissatisfied with their current cars before the useful life of those cars had ended.

“Sloanism” had a huge impact, replacing “Fordism” as the dominant ethos in the U.S. auto industry. By 1936, GM had seized 43 percent of the U.S. market. Ford, with 22 percent, had fallen to third place behind Chrysler (25 percent). Fueled by Sloan’s innovations, GM continued to lead the U.S. auto industry until the mid-1980s, when Ford again surpassed the company in profits.

By that time, the era of annually restyled car models had ended, thanks to federal standards governing automotive safety, pollution and energy and escalating gas prices. Many drivers began opting for smaller, foreign-made cars like Germany’s Volkswagen “bug” (a kind of latter-day Model T) and especially the well-built, fuel-efficient small cars coming out of Japan. Significant innovations in warehouse production and quality control helped Japan become the world’s foremost auto-producing country in 1980, and it’s remained on top ever since. (To put things in perspective, Toyota Motor has a market value of some $173 billion today, compared with Tesla’s $50.887 billion.)

Despite its innovations and high market value, Tesla sold just 76,230 (incredibly expensive) vehicles last year, missing its target of 80,000. Meanwhile, GM sold 10 million cars last year, and Ford sold 6.7 million. Boosters justify Tesla’s high stock price by pointing to long-term expectations for the company’s growth. There are some promising signs, including the release of the company’s Model 3 sedan, its first car marketed to the masses (with a price tag of around $35,000). Tesla has also built an international network of “superchargers” where owners can plug in for free, and will soon work with Panasonic on the production of massive quantities of batteries at a newly opened “gigafactory”.

Skeptics believe Tesla cannot meet its ambitious growth targets and predict that traditional automakers like GM and Ford might overtake it by expanding their own electric car offerings. One thing seems certain—by making highly desirable electric vehicles that go further and faster, and the cutting-edge batteries that power them, Tesla is well placed to drive the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles, transforming the auto industry yet again more than a century after its beginnings."

Investors are clearly betting on Tesla's potential, and are undeterred by factors such as Tesla's loss of $773 million in 2016, and the fact that it sells only a tiny fraction of the cars delivered annually by established competitors.

General Motors sold about 10 million cars in 2016 compared with Tesla's roughly 76,000.

Tesla has only had two profitable quarters in its history as a public company, while GM earned a profit of more than $9 billion last year.

Tesla shares rose more than 3 percent to reach a fresh all-time high of $313.73 in midafternoon trading Monday, after receiving the highest price forecast ever issued for the stock by an analyst at a major firm.

The stock closed up over 3 percent at $312.39 per share.

On Monday, PiperJaffray analyst Alexander Potter published a note upgrading his rating on the stock from neutral to overweight and raising his price target from $223 to $368.

In his note, Potter said Tesla has a ""captivating impact on consumers and shareholders alike"" that will be difficult for competitors to replicate, and that although bears may have rational arguments against the stock, those ""probably won't matter.""

""In many ways, TSLA seems to play by its own rules,"" Potter wrote. For instance, the company burns through cash at a rate ""better-established companies would likely be crucified for,"" devises ""unreasonably fast"" production timelines and ""spurns industry norms,"" by doing things such as choosing to sell directly to customers, rather than through dealers.

Even before Monday's surge, when Tesla overtook Ford in market cap on April 3, some were saying Tesla was overvalued.

Responding to the criticism at that time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that while Tesla could be considered ""absurdly overvalued,"" based on past performance, the company's share price reflects what Tesla could achieve in the future.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note on Thursday that while he does not see any reason Tesla shares should lose value in the short term, he does not think the company will necessarily emerge as the kind of industry leader some investors expect it to become.

But Tesla's current technology and businesses may leave it well-positioned to enter other markets that could further boost its value.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note published Wednesday that the company could potentially enter markets collectively worth trillions of dollars. These include a car-sharing business with a value Jonas estimates at around $10 trillion, a $1 trillion logistics market, and a $2 trillion to $3 trillion energy storage market.

Tesla’s Fremont factory brought hope to a blue-collar, racially diverse town with a manufacturing tradition. And this week, after reports of a 69 percent increase in first-quarter sales, the automaker passed Ford in market value. But though its products epitomize the future, workers like Richard Ortiz say Tesla’s labor conditions are mired in the past. Ortiz is a production associate in the closures department, assembling hoods, doors—“anything that opens or closes”—on Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Though videos of the Tesla factory emphasize robotic automation, over 6,000 workers engage in intense manual labor to build the cars.

“I have an eight-pound rivnut gun,” Ortiz said, referring to a tool that installs rivet nuts. “I’m doing that all day long. I’m to the point where, if I pick something up with any weight, within 30 seconds I have to drop it. That scares me; I want to be able to use my arm when I retire.”

Tesla workers say circumstances like Ortiz’s are commonplace at a factory that prioritizes production goals over health and safety. Now they’re fighting back against low pay, hazardous conditions, and a culture of intimidation, seeking to unionize through the United Auto Workers. Tesla is the only U.S. automaker using nonunion workers at a stateside plant, and breaking through would give organized labor a foothold in the tech industry as well. Until then, the Tesla experience reveals that green jobs aren’t necessarily good jobs without worker power. “They want to make sustainable cars,” says Ortiz. “We need sustainable employment.”

Tesla purchased the Fremont facility in 2010, after Toyota and General Motors shuttered what was then the nation’s most innovative auto plant. At NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.), management instituted Japanese production techniques that maximized efficiency. In the 1980s, “the productivity of the plant and the quality of the cars were equal to Toyota plants in Japan,” said Ruth Milkman, author of Farewell to the Factory, a study of U.S. autoworkers. “It was the plant to watch for a while.”

Jose Moran worked at NUMMI for eight years, and Tesla hired him as a production associate on the body line in 2012. “In the beginning, management would always promise, ‘Things will be better,’” Moran said. “But they never got better. I felt it was time to speak up.”

In February, Moran went public with a Medium blog post, confirming the union effort for the first time. His grievances with the way the plant operates, Moran wrote, “can’t be resolved without workers having a voice and being included in the process.”

The issues start with wages. According to Moran and co-workers, wages range from $17 to $21 an hour, well below the $29.04 national average hourly wage for motor vehicle manufacturing. Tesla claims stock awards push total compensation above autoworker averages, but workers counter that the stock doesn’t fully vest until four years of service. “I can’t tell a little kid, I’ll feed you in a year,” Ortiz said. Raises and promotions are also rare; Ortiz mentioned a colleague who received only one increase in seven years.

Tesla workers make luxury vehicles that can cost $90,000 or more but, unlike the people at Henry Ford’s plant, have no chance of buying one. “Seventeen dollars to $21 without a lot of benefits is not much higher than you can get being a gardener or a hotel clerk,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor history professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The low pay shrinks further in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has one of the nation’s highest costs of living. Though the heavily Asian and Latino residential districts around the factory feature modest one-story tract homes and apartments—I even saw a large mobile home park—housing costs are so exorbitant that employees cannot hope to live near the worksite. The median two-bedroom apartment in Fremont rents for $2,640 a month, according to ApartmentList.com. For a married Tesla worker making entry-level wages and working 43 hours a week, that’s equivalent to 90 percent of take-home pay.

Moran, a father of two, left Fremont because, he said, “I couldn’t make it, couldn’t save.” He now drives 59 miles to work from Manteca, in the San Joaquin Valley; his one-way commute can be as long as two hours. Jonathan Galescu, a body repair technician, lives 54 miles north, in Vallejo. Between gas and bridge tolls, “it costs me $15 to $17 just to get to work,” he said. Galescu did carpool with a colleague in Richmond to cut costs, but it took him additional time. “I had to make a decision: Do I take that extra gas money or spend 30 more minutes with my children?”

(Even parking can be an ordeal, as spaces are limited and far from the worksite. A gleaming new BART rail station opened in March, but it’s separated from the facility by freight train tracks, meaning workers using mass transit face a two-mile walk to work.)

TESLA HAS RECEIVED numerous subsidies for its U.S. factories, including a 2015 California Competes tax credit of $15 million for expansion of the Fremont plant. The implicit bargain with these government subsidies is that the private sector will create good-paying jobs. But Tesla only had to promise a minimum salary of $35,000 a year and an average salary of $55,000 to maintain eligibility for the tax credit.

Told about pay at the Tesla plant, Madeline Janis, a member of the California Competes committee who voted against the Tesla tax credit, said: “As a longtime worker rights advocate, [I’d say] that’s an outrage. Tesla should and can do better, as we know from the success of the company. There’s no reason why they can’t create good jobs in California.”

Most workers get by with overtime that they have no choice of turning down. Sixty-hour weeks are mandatory on the Model S line (known colloquially as the “shit line”), which is entirely manual labor. Model X workers often don’t know how long they’ll be staying when they come into work. The schedule depends on a daily target number of cars to build.

“There’s not a lot of attention toward anything but hitting the production goal,” said Jose Moran. Breakdowns on the line can make the number impossible to reach, forcing employees to stagger breaks to catch up. At the end of 2015, employees claimed, they worked every day for a month to hit the number, including weekends, plied with Red Bull and candy to keep going.

Without the overtime hours, low pay would make it difficult for workers to survive. But with OT, work-family balance becomes impossible. “I see my kids grow up through Facebook,” said Galescu. “My son always cries for me to stay home—‘Don’t go to work!’”

Galescu works the night shift repairing defects, mostly while the cars are still in motion. He and his five-man team jump in and out of cars, pulling out dents and dings. Management recently cut the repair work time per car from 180 seconds to 90. If workers can’t complete the task, it causes slowdowns on the line. Sometimes every car has the same defect, created by small pieces of dirt in the auto body stamping machine. “I have a friend in stamping who said if they’d just allow them a few more minutes to make sure they’re clean before they run, the defects would be way lower,” said Richard Ortiz.

Two years ago, Galescu said, a part from a Model S rear underbody popped out and hit Galescu in the chest, sending him flying across the shop floor. “My chest was on fire,” Galescu said, showing me a picture of the massive welt it created. His supervisor tried to get him back on the line that day, but security personnel allowed him to go home. When Galescu returned to work, the supervisor berated him for the injury, even though he repeatedly warned the supervisor that the underbody machine was malfunctioning.

“He said, 'You caused me to be late going home to my wife,’” Galescu said. “I really thought I was going to lose my job.”

In his blog post, Moran noted that six of the eight people on his team have been out on medical leave at one time. According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics, since 2012, the plant has been cited for 40 different safety violations, compiling $143,835 in fines (about $6,000 of which are still being contested). By comparison, in its last five years of operation, NUMMI incurred only 17 violations, with $48,755 in fines, while pumping out far more vehicles. Tesla’s fines resulted from numerous accidents and investigations, including explosions, burns, and a 2016 case where a contract worker fell three stories from the plant roof. (Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that Tesla’s injury rate was under half of the national average, and that Moran’s assertion was erroneous.)

Workers allege that Tesla stigmatizes reporting injuries. While the company offers workers compensation insurance, light duty off the line can reduce pay to the minimum wage. Supervisors allegedly brand those willing to report injuries as malingerers. “They blacklist you, they treat you like crap,” Galescu said. Ortiz added that workers have been fired for excessive medical problems. “They don’t say they’re fired, but all of a sudden they’re gone.” So workers often keep quiet about aches and pains.

Tesla spokesman Dave Arnold did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this story.

A voice on the job could help prevent unnecessary injuries, and make assembly lines more efficient. But unlike the NUMMI days, workers now have no say, and there’s no process through which to lodge grievances. “I had a supervisor say, ‘We’re not dealing with HR, they’re just a bunch of women in skirts who don’t know what they’re doing,’” Galescu said.

With workers pressured, overworked and battered by the line, and absent from family milestones, employee burnout is common and morale is low. “We’re employed, but not gainfully,” said Ortiz. “We need to see a future for ourselves.”

In the short term, things could get worse. In March, Tesla announced a $1.15 billion stock offering, to finance the launch of the Model 3, its newest, mid-priced vehicle. Tesla already has almost 400,000 Model 3s on back order, with deliveries expected later this year. Elon Musk has promised that the plant will produce 500,000 cars a year by 2018. That’s five times as many as current output, and it signals an even deeper attention to numbers.

But the Model 3 ramp-up also presents leverage for workers. Moran and his colleagues insist that they want to make the plant function better. “We work on the machines 10 to 12 hours a day, we know what could work,” Moran said. “We’re not trying to bash Tesla, we want the company to succeed.”

Moran’s open letter came after six months of internal organizing; the UAW confirmed hiring organizers for the plant in February. Tesla initially responded favorably. “You see safety people walking around, fixing things that weren’t fixed before,” Moran said. “It took one person to speak up.” In November, Tesla offered a 50-cent increase to base pay for the first time in years. Four months later, the company added another 50 cents.

But after originally describing Tesla as “union neutral,” Musk said on an earnings call in February that “there are really only disadvantages to someone to want the UAW here.” In a later email to workers, Musk delivered a point-by-point rebuttal to Moran’s Medium post, arguing that overtime had decreased and incident rates were below average. Instead of offering workers better wages and input on production, Musk promised “a really amazing party” for the launch of the Model 3, “free frozen yogurt stands” at the factory, and “a Tesla electric pod roller coaster” connecting the parking lots. “It’s going to get crazy good,” Musk concluded.

MIDDLE-CLASS MANUFACTURING workers seeking higher pay aren’t dazzled by the kind of perks Facebook coders enjoy. They chuckled whenever I brought up the yogurt and the roller coaster. “If I want to go on a roller coaster, pay me enough so I can go when I want to,” said Richard Ortiz. “It’s insulting, it shows you what he thinks of us.”

Labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein expressed horror at Musk’s rhetoric. “It was the worst kind of caricature of a capitalist, like it’s 1898,” he said. “They have these sophisticated systems of production and distribution, but their social arrangements are utterly retrograde.”

Moran has taken the assault from his boss in stride. “People come up to me and say you’re doing a good job,” he said. “It goes to show that [Musk] is 100 percent out of touch with what’s going on at the plant.” Moran and his colleagues have started a Facebook group, A Fair Future at Tesla, with videos of Moran and others telling their stories.

In November, workers were forced to sign an extremely broad, retroactive confidentiality agreement, one that vowed consequences if they speak publicly about Tesla—including about wages and working conditions. Confidentiality agreements are common in auto factories to protect trade secrets, but this was so far-reaching that five members of the California legislature wrote to Tesla, warning that the agreement violated protected employee activity guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act.

Organizers say Tesla’s aim was to create a chilling effect. “When you try to organize, [the workers] are afraid, they think you’re undercover,” said Ortiz.

The UAW has tried unsuccessfully to organize nonunion auto plants run by foreign manufacturers, including a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee where UAW secured the neutrality of the employer and still lost a union vote. (A later vote partially succeeded, but is mired in court). Not only is the Tesla factory in the heart of blue-state California, but in a region with a strong organizing history. However, Tesla also sits at the nexus between blue collar and Silicon Valley, where organized labor has barely penetrated.

Heightened activism after President Trump’s election has forced tech firms to take stands of resistance, while union drives have arisen among security officers and cafeteria workers in tech office parks. But organizing Fremont would be an order of larger magnitude, especially because it would actually realize the promise of green technology jobs. “I’m always telling my environmental friends, don’t be enamored of these green capitalists,” said Joe Uehlein of the Labor Network for Sustainability. “We should be fighting for that missing leg of the sustainability stool, economic justice. And it’s important for the UAW to signal that they see a future in renewables and clean vehicles, that they’re not just a union of people who drive pickup trucks.”

Tesla has been praised for creating manufacturing jobs domestically rather than overseas. Clean energy in the United States is as big an industry as pharmaceutical manufacturing. But the jobs created aren’t automatically high-paying, good places to work. Politicians cite the quantity of green jobs without enough concern about their quality. The same problems of low wages, offshoring production and lack of collective bargaining prevalent throughout the economy can crop up in environmentally friendly enterprises. “No worker or community should ever be the roadkill on the path to a better world,” said Uehlein.

Richard Ortiz, who worked at NUMMI for 22 years and actually had retired before being drawn back to Tesla, continually expressed pride in working at a leading-edge manufacturer. “I love to wear my gear all over town,” he said. “I thank Tesla for giving me the opportunity to work there. They will give anyone a chance. But a chance at what?”

Boudette,"In the past four weeks, exuberant investors have driven up the share price of Tesla, putting the upstart in the league of car companies that have been in the business for a century.

But there are others who think Tesla, for all its potential, has become an overpriced investment — and something of a risky play in the near or medium term, given the challenges of turning battery-powered cars into mass-market products.

Among the skeptics are some of Tesla’s biggest fans.

Take Dennis Pascual, a tech industry consultant in Long Beach, Calif., and owner of two Teslas — a Model S sedan and a two-seat Roadster, the first car Tesla put on the road. He is such a fan, in fact, that he has put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts once Tesla starts making the car later this year.

He also owns some Tesla stock, but is not about to buy more.

“It’s a little pricey for me to jump back in,” he said, speaking by phone from his Model S. “Right now, I think we’re in a hold.”"

Silicon Valley’s Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) overtook General Motors (GM.N) on Monday to become the U.S. car maker with the largest market capitalization as the century-old automobile industry increases its reliance on software and cutting-edge energy technology.

That milestone is likely to be on the minds of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra as they and other CEOs visit the White House on Tuesday to discuss tax reform and infrastructure with President Donald Trump.

Helped by an analyst's recommendation, Tesla rose 3.26 percent to a record high of $312.39 on Monday. Its market value of $50.887 billion exceeded GM's by about $1 million.

Over the past month, the luxury electric car maker has surged 35 percent as investors bet that Musk will revolutionize the automobile and energy industries.

That compares to a declining share performance by GM in recent years that recently led billionaire investor David Einhorn to propose splitting the stock into two classes to help boost its price.

Tesla’s market capitalization is now equivalent to $102,000 for every car it plans to make in 2018, or $667,000 per car sold last year. By comparison, GM’s market capitalization is equivalent to $5,000 per car it sold in 2016.

The Palo Alto, California company is rushing to launch its mass-market Model 3 sedan in the second half of 2017 and quickly ramp up its factory to reach a production target of 500,000 cars per year in 2018. Last year it sold 76,230, missing its target of at least 80,000 vehicles. By comparison, GM sold 10 million cars and Ford sold 6.7 million.

With its stock down nearly 20 percent since 2013, GM has scaled back operations outside the United States while pushing to improve its profitability. It announced in March it would sell its European operations.

Reflecting Wall Street’s worries, GM’s stock trades at 6 times its expected earnings, the lowest multiple among companies in the S&P 500.

Proponents believe Tesla, which is not profitable, argue its stock price is justified based on long-term expectations for Tesla’s growth.

They also point to opportunities from Tesla’s acquisition last year of money-losing solar panel installer SolarCity and Tesla’s Nevada battery cell plant aimed at driving down manufacturing costs.

ANALYST ENTHUSIASTIC

After driving a Tesla for seven months, Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter on Monday upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”, describing Tesla’s products as “captivating”.

“Tesla isn’t just another company. More so than any stock we’ve covered, Tesla engenders optimism, freedom, defiance, and a host of other emotions that, in our view, other companies cannot replicate,” Potter wrote in a report.

Skeptics believe Tesla’s growth targets are unrealistic and that the company risks being overtaken by GM, Ford and other deep-pocketed manufacturers ramping up their own electric-vehicle offerings.

Its market capitalization remains smaller than Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), at $173 billion.

Tesla’s rich valuation has made it a target of short sellers, who so far in 2017 have suffered over $2 billion in paper losses as the stock rallied.

Jeffrey Gundlach, who oversees over $105 billion in assets at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, told Reuters last week: “As a car company alone, Tesla is crazy high valuation. As a battery company - one that expands and innovates substantially - maybe the valuation can work.”"

Tesla almost went bankrupt in late 2008, but since then Elon Musk's all-electric-car maker has more than survived — it's prospered, against all the odds. With a market cap that surpassed General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — the Detroit Big Three — at one point this year, Tesla became the Big One as far as new American automakers go.

What Musk and Tesla have achieved is monumentally impressive. Before Tesla, the consensus was that the car business chewed up and spit out new players, the classic example being the ill-fated mid-20th-century entrepreneur Preston Tucker.

Musk is a bigger deal that Tucker ever was. Tucker did rate a Francis Ford Coppola-directed biopic, ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream in 1988,"" but Musk is also trying to colonize Mars with SpaceX and was a model for the Tony Stark character in ""Iron Man.""

Having just started production of its Model 3 mass-market car, Tesla is riding high and, for the most part, is surfing a strong wave of investor confidence — or overconfidence, depending on your point of view. The bear argument that the carmaker that will struggle to build 100,000 vehicles this year while GM and Ford assemble and sell more than a million apiece isn't worth roughly the same value, or even close to it.

Great expectations

The bulls, by contrast, promise not just the moon but also Mars and a few other planets. Former Apple analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster recently offered the preposterous notion that Tesla's addressable US market alone could be 11 million vehicles sold annually.

That would constitute a 65% market share in today's market of roughly 17 million cars sold annually. The baseline US market is more like 15 million, so if Munster, evidently a big fan of monopoly power, thinks Tesla could control well over half the market in a boom, one assumes the carmaker would manage something similar in a weaker sales environment.

The level of overstatement is antihistorical. At its peak in the mid-1950, with essentially only two competitors in Ford and Chrysler, GM controlled just over half of the US market. Since then, a dozen competing brands have arrived, knocking GM's still No. 1 share down to less than 20% and providing consumers with a number of choices.

It wouldn't just be completely unprecedented for Tesla to get that large. It would probably invite antitrust action after Musk has decimated the existing auto industry in the US from dealer showroom to factory floor.

But such is the state of Tesla punditry, especially in the tech-finance side, where monopolists are welcome. Obviously, Tesla has more than miles to go before Munster's calculus pans out. Even with the Model 3 launch, Musk's goal of a million vehicles in annual production by 2020 would demand a radical rethink of the EV market, which now adds up to only about 1% of global sales.

We're ... No. 6

The Chevy Bolt. Hollis Johnson

But let's grant Munster that Tesla will continue to prosper and grow. Following this line of thinking, another prospect emerges: Tesla won't be the biggest US carmaker in an electric-car world— instead, it could occupy the middle of the pack. That's right. Even among electric-car makers, Tesla wouldn't be No. 1. It would be, like, No. 6 or 7.

Let's look at the current US No. 1 for an explanation why.

GM went from concept to production on its own mass-market EV, the Chevy Bolt, in about a year and a half. The vehicle rolled out in limited release last fall and is now selling about 1,500 units a month, probably a bit more than GM expected. Combined with the gas-electric Chevy Volt hybrid, GM is now the top US seller of electrified vehicles that are not Teslas.

GM, as it has in the past with gas-powered machines, could also use the Bolt as a segmentation opportunity, offering larger all-electric vehicles, small pickups, maybe even sports cars using the same vehicle architecture and technology. The company is exceptionally good at rapidly scaling up global production based on demand. A level of 1,500 Bolts today could go to 5,000 literally next month, while Musk as Tesla try to ramp the Model 3 from 30 this past July to a predicted 5,000 by the end of the year.

GM certainly isn't alone in the capability; the rest of the traditional global auto industry could also quickly switch from gas to electric propulsion if demand surges.

Electric cars are nothing new. The technology has been around for 100 years, losing out to the internal-combustion engine in the early 20th century and held back over more recent decades by battery chemistry. With 200-mile ranges finally possible at an affordable price, the EV could at long last be ready for its close-up.

So let's say Tesla gets to a million in sales by 2020, and let's limit those sales to the US. Conservatively, that would be about a 7% market share, and, for the sake of argument, let's project that share out into the future as EVs displace internal-combustion-engine cars. I won't even delve into profitability — a big question for Tesla as it moves from $100,000 luxury EVs to $35,000 cars for the people — so we can keep it simple.

Middle of the pack

Welcome to the middle. Thomson Reuters

Tesla won't be able to add assembly lines fast enough to move past that level over the next few years, so the upshot is that its share would be about what Hyundai and Kia together control now. What you have to accept here is that Tesla doesn't now and won't soon have the capacity to dominate given its currently modest manufacturing footprint (a single, somewhat outdated factory in California with a theoretical annual production max of 500,000 units).

So if EV demand really takes off, Tesla won't be able to fully service it. Nor does Musk even want to, despite what the Munsters of the world might think! He's all about more EVs on the road. They don't have to be Teslas. Enter the legacy automakers and their ability to build a lot of cars in a hurry. The market-share framework in the US could remain the same, just with propulsion systems switched from gas to electric.

Tesla thus occupies a middle-of-the-pack position, with a potentially profitable luxury business topping out at about 75,000 to 100,000 in annual sales by 2020 and a mass-market business yielding between 500,000and 900,000, all depending on how robust the overall market is. Unfortunately for Tesla, competition across all segments would be impossible, so the carmaker would lose out on EV pickup and large SUV sales, as well as sales within segments, such as compact crossovers.

Tesla would then be the No. 6 or No. 7 player in the US. Perhaps the story would be different in China, but compared with its US sales, Tesla's China sales still have a way to go before GM or Volkswagen have anything to worry about.

A hard lesson for Silicon Valley

Learning from VW. Thomson Reuters

What does this mean for Tesla financially? Well, it actually suggests that the carmaker's market cap isn't totally out whack, as long as it doesn't grow much beyond $50 billion-ish levels in the future. Tesla would basically become what VW wants to be in the US: a company that offers both mass-market and luxury options.

What does this mean for Silicon Valley? It's a disaster. The US auto market is textbook anti-monopolistic. Nobody can achieve more than 20% share, and competition is ferocious at every level, from innovation and design to price. Consumers benefit enormously from this. Investors, not so much, as the laggard stock prices of Ford and GM for the past five years amply demonstrate.

Tesla's holds a middle-of-the-pack position, with a weak product lineup. It has only three vehicles now, with perhaps five or six in the picture by 2020, optimistically. And dependence on the Model 3, whose profits margins at an average sales price of something like $40,000, are bound to be wimpy. It all means that the company's aggregate margin will be less than 10%.

It's fun to be Tesla now. But it won't necessarily be if this scenario comes to pass. Paradoxically, the business would be more stable. But the story won't be one of dominating, high-tech future excitement. It would be one of continuous dog fighting for every sale — exactly what every carmaker doing business in the US wakes up to every day."

As much as they raved about the amazing automation, gigantic presses, and hundreds of robots, the reality was they only saw half of the actual manufacturing that was taking place in the building. Unknown to most visitors, the factory’s “secret” second floor built many of Tesla’s battery, power electronics, and drive-train systems. It was home to some of the most advanced manufacturing and automation systems in the company. Some of the robots moved at such high speeds that their arms needed to be built from carbon fiber instead of steel.

Though it was obvious why we were building the systems at the heart of our product, such as the battery and motors, many people had difficulty understanding why we manufactured high-voltage cables, displays, fuses, and other smaller systems. Had we spent too much time inhaling the “we know better” fumes of Silicon Valley? Why take on the madness of not only starting a new car company but also making it more vertically integrated than any car company since the heyday of the Ford Rouge plant in the late 1920s?

The answer is simple: Our goal wasn’t to build the best electric vehicle. It was to build the best premium car in the world that just happened to be an EV. This meant integrating technologies that were not readily available. It also meant pushing the boundaries of what was considered “normal” for the design and manufacturing of a car. Furthermore, we needed to do this on an accelerated timeline that most automotive suppliers could not fathom. So, in many cases, this meant building components ourselves. Building your own core components has obvious benefits, but there are some other advantages that you might not immediately recognize.

Speed is the first advantage. Launching a new product presents a team with thousands of small decisions. If you choose to outsource a component, you often need to send people to live in the factory for a prolonged period of time. This means accepting that it’s going to be harder to make choices and to influence outcomes. First, you’re operating within someone else’s environment. Second, you have far less of the product design team available for on-the-spot consultation and decision-making. Nothing beats the ability to have the full engineering team walk into the manufacturing area every day, talk to the people building the products, and gain insights on how to improve. Factory information has a very short half life. Despite what many contract manufacturers promise, the reality of outsourced manufacturing is that you are getting on an airplane to solve problems you could otherwise solve by walking across your building.

The second reason building your own products makes sense is that it enables you to drive faster cycles of learning and improvement. The idea of bundling improvements and building them into the next platform every three to four years (the typical development cycle for the car industry) made absolutely no sense to us at Tesla. Rolling many improvements into a package often means that some items get delayed waiting on some other item that’s essential to their production, which results in a lower cumulative improvement rate.

Our approach at Tesla was to adopt improvements as soon as they were ready. This meant we were implementing up to 50 changes per week. We often joked that if you wanted to know the “model year” of your Tesla, you needed to look at the individual car’s VIN number. Despite mastering real-time changes to products, this approach created minor inefficiencies in our manufacturing system. Yet what was more important: extracting a couple percentage points of manufacturing efficiency, or building a product that was rapidly improving and pulling farther ahead of the competition? Nothing beats the speed and ability to change like having your own manufacturing operation.

Finally, when you build something yourself, you develop a far deeper understanding of your product and how to improve it—and the pain of doing it yourself gets transmuted into gold. A great example is the innovation that allowed Tesla to make “Ludicrous Mode” possible. One of the constraints in increasing the power output of the battery in the early Model S was the safety fuse and switch system that was integrated into the pack. A fuse? How hard could it be to find a fuse that enables the increased current levels needed for this performance?

It turns out that it is really hard to build a fuse that allows a massive amount of current to flow during normal operation while also protecting the car in milliseconds if there’s an abnormal spike in current flow. Building fuses in-house helped us solve this problem. The coupling of deep product knowledge with a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics allowed us to do what most people thought was impossible. As a result, Tesla drivers everywhere are grinning slyly as they shock their passengers with the thrill of a 0-to-60 sprint in under 2.8 seconds.

Is building your own product always the right answer? Certainly not. If you’re building a product that leverages commodity items and will not change significantly, then it doesn’t make sense to build yourself. Yet if you’re building a product that contains unique intellectual property or has a high change velocity, it can be the best choice.

A layered capacity strategy is often the right approach. Start by building the product with your own small manufacturing operation, ideally in the same building as your engineers, designers, and product teams. Use this pilot line to learn quickly, iterate, and develop an understanding of what it takes to build your product. As you then scale beyond this initial capacity, layer on outside contract manufacturing capacity.

This strategy has several advantages. First, you gain the knowledge to keep the contract manufacturers honest. Need to make a small change to the product? Test it on your internal pilot line and then deploy it to your contract manufacturer. This short-circuits arguments over how much additional labor is needed because you already have direct experience with the incremental costs. Second, this initial line becomes your platform for developing the next-generation product and building samples. With a layered capacity approach, you enjoy the benefits of fast cycles of learning while also leveraging the more efficient supply chain of larger contract manufacturers.

Why am I so passionate about this? Early in my career, I was a participant in the offshoring of US manufacturing. We built factories that were pushing the state of the art in several areas of technology—yet all of it was outside of the US. Because of this trend, American industry lost some of the fundamental knowledge that comes from building your own products.

For too long now, a fear of building new hardware companies has gripped enterprises and entrepreneurs. To solve many important problems, you need to touch the physical world. Disease, energy, infrastructure, mobility, and other complex challenges require multidisciplinary solutions that include hardware. We need bold founders to tackle these important problems. The time has come for us to build things again—and recapture the knowledge and competitive advantage it creates for our businesses and communities."

He didn't mention there would be lawyers.

But the bottlenecks and delays getting the new assembly lines up and running have prompted at least one shareholder lawsuit alleging that Tesla and Musk improperly hid its problems from its investors.

And six other law firms have issued statements recently seeking investors to be plaintiffs in planned class action suits against the electric car maker.

Tesla said on Oct. 2 that it could only build 260 of its Model 3 cars during the third quarter, rather than the 1,500 it had forecast to investors earlier in the year. The company claimed that ""a handful"" of assembly lines had taken ""longer to activate than expected.""

On Oct. 6 the Wall Street Journal did a story, quoting unnamed sources within the company, saying that the problem was that major portions of the new cars were still being built by hand rather than on automated assembly lines.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) lost 4% the next trading day, and have lost an additional 6% since then. At that time, Tesla issued a statement disputing that article, saying that every Model 3 is being built on an automated assembly line.

""However, every vehicle manufacturing line in the world has both manual and automated processes,"" said the company's Tuesday statement. ""As we've always acknowledged, it will take time to fine-tune the line for higher volumes.""

The company said it is confident it can correct bottlenecks soon, and that it laid out potential short-term problems for investors back in July when it unveiled the first Model 3.

""There's a reason it's called production hell,"" said its statement.

Tesla reports full third quarter financial results on Wednesday after the market close, and might provide new Model 3 production targets for the rest of the year.

The shareholder suit filed on Oct. 10, which seeks class action status, cites the Journal report in addition the company's own production number. Five of the press releases from other attorneys seeking investors to join their suits also cite the Journal's report.

Tesla did not comment on any of the shareholder suit efforts that have been announced. They aren't the only legal challenges the company now faces.

Tesla has been hit with four lawsuits in recent months from workers alleging racial, LGBT and gender discrimination at its plant in Fremont, California. Tesla has told CNNMoney that it takes all complaints seriously, but, ""in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company. Not one.""

The United Auto Workers union has also filed an unfair labor practice complaint with federal labor authorities alleging that employees were fired for supporting unionization efforts at its assembly plant, a charge Tesla also denies."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tesla Tesla

Tesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juan's Hospital del Niño (Children's Hospital), in what company founder Elon Musk calls ""the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.""

The project came about after Puerto Rico was hit by two devastating and powerful hurricanes in September, and Musk reached out about Tesla helping.

Musk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, ""Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities.""

Tesla's image of the project's solar array, in a parking lot next to the hospital, has been liked more than 84,000 times since it was posted to Instagram Tuesday.

Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that some of his company's work is being rerouted so it could ""increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.""

The hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs, according to El Nuevo Dia. The facility has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions; it also offers services to some 3,000 young patients, the newspaper says. As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells Nuevo Dia that for now, it's a donation — and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent.

Both Rossello and the tech company tweeted about the project this week, with Tesla saying in a post, ""Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello"" — and Rossello stating, ""A major contribution of @Tesla to the Hospital del Niño.""

The news of restoring permanent power at the hospital comes as millions of people in Puerto Rico continue to rely on generators for electricity. As of Wednesday morning, the Electric Power Authority reported that its power service was at 25 percent.

The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid is expected to take months and to cost as much as $5 billion.

Last week, the territory's electric and power authority signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a small and relatively young Montana company, to restore the power grid. The deal has sparked scrutiny and skepticism, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley and Nicky Ouellet of Montana Public Radio reported.

Tesla isn't the only tech company trying to help Puerto Rico; Google's parent company, Alphabet, has deployed balloons from its Project Loon to the territory, to help parts of the island reconnect after much of its phone system went down. The portable network can help phone users with both messaging and some web browsing."

Tesla Tesla ramped up its efforts to become a big data company under Chris Lattner, one of Apple's most famous developers who left the electric carmaker last Wednesday after just 6 months of employment.

Lattner's public résumé highlights how data is playing an increasingly important role in Tesla's business model going forward.

""One of Tesla's huge advantages in the autonomous driving space is that it has tens of thousands of cars already on the road,"" Lattner wrote. ""We built infrastructure to take advantage of this, allowing the collection of image and video data from this fleet, as well as building big data infrastructure in the cloud to process and use it.""

Under Lattner, Tesla updated its sharing policy in May to store and process the data collected by Model S and Model X vehicles on the road today.

""We are working hard to improve autonomous safety features and make self-driving a reality for you as soon as possible,"" Tesla wrote in a May message to owners, according to Electrek. ""In order to do so, we need to collect short video clips using the car's external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions. The more fleet learning of road conditions we are able to do, the better your Tesla's self-driving ability will become.""

Tesla asked owners for approval in May before collecting the anonymized data.

Tesla has access to a bigger trove of data than ever before thanks to a suite of new hardware that the company has been installing in vehicles since last October. That hardware will eventually support Tesla's second-generation Autopilot system and full self-driving capabilities.

Chris Lattner, Tesla's VP of Autopilot software, left the company after just six months. LinkedIn/Chris Lattner Lattner's big focus on data collection during his brief stint at Tesla says a great deal about CEO Elon Musk's vision for the company.

McKinsey & Co. researchers predict that car data monetization on a global scale is set to become a $450 billion to $750 billion by 2030.

Tesla, which resembles more of a tech company than a traditional automaker, is better equipped to capitalize on big data as a company that already uses software updates to enhance vehicles on the road.

""High-tech companies, start-ups, alternative mobility operators, data management services, insurers, roadside assistance providers, and infrastructure operators will all be players in the car data monetization landscape,"" the McKinsey team wrote. ""It is the most traditional of automotive players, however, who may find staking a claim most challenging.""

Tesla is smart to focus on data collection early.

Not only does to aid Tesla's autonomous driving development before the company's public demo of the technology this year, but it gives Tesla the advantage of time as competition in the space heats up.

Israeli startup Otonomo, for example, is already helping big automakers like Daimler collect and sell data to third parties.

""[Internet of Cars] is too big and too complementary to harvesting and analyzing data for the world's most valuable firms to ignore,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jona wrote in a May research note. ""As such, we expect the next few months and years to reveal a number of catalysts that show with little ambiguity that there are some very big technological and commercial bets being made right in Tesla's backyard."""
https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/26/15872468/tesla-gm-ford-valuation-justifying-disruption,pos,1.0,5.098088947097959e-57,Why Tesla is overhyped — and overvalued,2017-06-26 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:19:33.578701,Aug,"Tesla’s long-awaited Model 3, its first mass-market offering, has finally arrived. In June, Brent Goldfarb assessed the company’s prospects:

Silicon Valley investors love to talk about “disruption” — they are besotted with the storyline of small, scrappy, high-tech underdogs upending boring “legacy” corporations. And nowhere is this disruption fetish more evident than in the valuation of Tesla, maker of expensive, well-reviewed electric cars that bestow status on their owners.

Recently, Tesla’s valuation surpassed both Ford’s and General Motors’. BMW is among the other major carmakers in the rearview mirror. The logic of this is intriguing, given that Ford, for example, is coming off its second-best year in its 112-year history, earning $4.6 billion while selling more than 5.5 million cars worldwide. General Motors earned $9.4 billion selling 9.8 million vehicles.

Tesla, meanwhile, sold 76,000 cars while losing near $1 billion. Judged by the valuation, anyway, Tesla appears to be the first successful American entrant into the automobile industry since Chrysler in 1922.

Everyone likes to root for the underdog. David beat Goliath with his new slingshot technology and neutralized the advantages of a giant. The hapless, and slightly naughty, Bad News Bears win the championship. Disruption is fundamentally an underdog story, propelling entrepreneurs and infusing fear into incumbents. Much money has been made, and lost, on this storyline. And it’s a narrative that Tesla founder Elon Musk has cultivated well as he has jumped from one underdog-disruption scenario to the next, ditching various subplots as they become more and more implausible: Electric cars! Batteries! Solar! Self-driving cars! Recently he tweeted that Tesla is about to unveil a new semi and pickups. Truck companies beware!

By conventional measures, Tesla is a small concern, but investors are placing their bets that it is a disruptor, a concept that has near-magical qualities in some business circles. The term comes from the work of the Harvard Business School professor Clay Christensen’s Innovators’ Dilemma.

While the term is often used loosely to describe any exciting new company, disruption is actually defined fairly precisely in Christensen’s work (if with plenty of wiggle room). In theory, an existing firm can be disrupted if it complacently ignores the needs of its customers — or at least technological trends that threaten to make its market and technology positions obsolete.

A disruption theorist would explain Kodak’s downfall by arguing that Kodak ignored the threat posed by digital photography because it was too focused on the seemingly steady and solid profits produced by selling film. Likewise, Blockbuster ignored Netflix’s DVD-by-mail model and later streaming, leading to its bankruptcy.

Ignoring these innovations may have seemed sensible at first: Low-resolution digital photography did not appeal to Kodak’s customers, and Netflix started out by offering odd and old movies, i.e., not blockbusters. Why would Blockbuster bother to compete with that?

Slowly the quality of these offerings improved and neither Kodak nor Blockbuster were able to catch up. A textbook disruptive strategy targets the low end of the existing market. But sometimes disruption can come from above! Nokia as well as RIM (maker of the Blackberry) were unable to respond to the iPhone and Android one-two-punch. A disruption theory purist would insist that Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia, or RIM might have navigated the technological transition — and thrived — if only they’d paid attention to the changing markets.

But a more plausible, if conventional, argument might be that transitions in those instances were not only improbable, but not even advisable. It would have been a herculean task to transform a chemical company specializing in the production of silver oxide film to a consumer electronics firm, fighting for attention in a low-margin industry.

Sometimes firms weather disruptive threats with little trouble. New biotechnologies that allow us to modify DNA led to a completely different drug discovery technology, eroding the drug discovery capabilities of large pharmaceuticals. However, the list of top pharma companies has barely changed in the past century. Their capabilities in shepherding drugs through the FDA process, as well as selling and marketing drugs — none of which biotech startups have easily replicated (Genentech notwithstanding).

The biotech startups still make money, but they typically end up licensing their technologies to, or are purchased outright by, big pharma. In 2000, online grocer Webvan set out to disrupt the bricks-and-mortar grocery business with a model that may have worked — if only 25 percent to 40 percent of groceries were purchased online. Sadly, that wasn’t the case then and still isn’t the case. As of 2016, about 5 percent of groceries were purchased online.

Nevertheless, the story soaked up $1 billion from public and private investors before failing. On-line ordering and delivery survivor Peapod eventually purchase by Giant, has taught us that online ordering complements bricks-and-mortar grocery stores, rather than substitutes for them. Most shoppers like to see, touch and feel their fruits and vegetables before purchasing them. Amazon deemed it wise to buy Whole Foods, as opposed to building an on-line fresh foods department independently.

Who and what is Tesla disrupting? Let’s explore some possibilities.

So is Tesla the next Honda, or the next Webvan? If one believes that Tesla is worth more than Ford or GM, one better have a decent theory of how Tesla is making current capabilities obsolete, why incumbents cannot replicate these capabilities, and whether Tesla will earn good margins in a post-Detroit world. In short, when betting on disruption, one has to identify how this disruption will occur — not just intone the magic word. I identify four bets that Tesla is plausibly making: the EV bet, the autonomous vehicle bet, a software-platform-in-a-car bet, or the clean-energy-and-battery-company bet. None of these bets appear particularly promising.

Getting this right matters. Investors stand to lose money if they bet on disruption, without thinking through the logic carefully. The disruption narrative drives the allocation of large sums of money — and directing these moneys based on ill-conceived stories is wasteful. The disruption storyline can cause corporate leaders to overreact — either by trying to catch a wave that they should ignore because it won’t affect them (as their chance of catching it is near hopeless), or because the new market is not worth winning at all.

The electric vehicle bet

My grandfather was a grocer in Duluth, Minnesota. He lived in a small apartment above the store and, in 1928, he purchased an “any color so long as you-like-black” Model T — the only car Ford produced between 1908 and 1927. My pragmatic grandfather’s purchase embodied a truth that has remained constant since the beginning of the industry: the sweet spot in the automobile market is practical cars for the middle class. One hundred years later, mid-size, practical cars such as sedans and smaller SUVs are still the largest market segments in the automobile market.

So far, Tesla has made its reputation selling exquisitely engineered electric vehicles in luxury market. Today the starting MSRP is $68,000, though most are sold for more.

For Tesla to disrupt via the EV bet — for it to sell enough electric vehicles to justify its optimistic valuation — it will have to sell a car in the sweet spot. Indeed, this is the point of the much-delayed Model 3, first deliveries of which are supposed to occur this year, for an expected average price of $42,000. The much-delayed part is not surprising. It is exceptionally difficult to mass produce cars — though, notably, it’s something that existing auto producers do exceptionally well.

But give the company the benefit of the doubt: Tesla may be able to learn. And indeed, 400,000 customers plopped down $1,000 deposits each for the Model 3! If they are the start of a trend, then this will give Tesla ample opportunity to learn to produce quickly and reliably. But keep in mind that electric vehicle sales have systematically underperformed projections for years. Last year, when the Model S fell short of projected sales, Tesla began discounting it by about 10 percent. Nevertheless, it still missed its sales targets by about the same number: 10 percent.

Just as important, for the disruption theory to play out, we’d expect incumbents to be ignoring the EV space, just as Kodak supposedly ignored digital photography at first. (They didn’t, but we’ll get to that in a minute.) If that were true, once the performance of EVs become sufficiently advanced, Tesla’s advantages would be solidified — and Ford and GM would become MBA case studies for what not to do in the face of a challenge. But as it happens, existing players are investing heavily in the space: Ford invested $5 billion in EV technology last year alone, it offers several EVs already, and the recent firing of Ford CEO Mark Fields suggests that its board is interested in moving even faster on this front.

GM is not asleep, either: Its Bolt is available with a 238-mile range. Nissan is expected to offer a similar product in the 2018 model year, and the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt is selling very well. Toyota’s new $27,000 plug-in Prius will go 25 miles before its internal combustion motor kicks in. In fact, it is difficult to find a car company not selling an electric car or plug-in hybrid today.

But even if disruption is not occurring in the traditional sense, the incumbents may still be in trouble. While Kodak’s film business became obsolete, Kodak was not blind to the digital future. At several points in its history Kodak was a technological leader in digital photography. Kodak produced the world’s first digital camera in 1975. Yours truly still has floppy disks with digital images and software that were returned with developed Kodak film from 2002, and also owned an excellent Kodak digital camera in 2004 — when Kodak held a leading position in the digital camera industry. But it was difficult to compete in the low-margin consumer electronics industry (never mind that the low-end photography market is now completely occupied by smartphone manufacturers). Highly competitive markets are crappy to be in, disruption or no disruption.

Tesla has a similar problem. The target price for the Model 3 is an aggressive $35,000, the space occupied by a fully equipped Nissan Leaf, the Chevy Bolt and Volt, the Ford Focus EV, and the VW e-Golf. (Should I continue?) These cars may lack the cool of the Model 3, but EV buyers clearly have options. Moreover, these companies can lose money on EVs and finance this with sales of other cars; 100,000 cars is a rounding error for GM or Ford. Tesla’s strategy is to finance through pre-selling (admirable!) and raising lots of money through the sale of stocks and bonds.

If Tesla can profitably sell the Model 3 at $35,000, its margins will still be razor thin, as they are for other cars in this space. Consider that luxury car maker BMW’s margins are 8 percent. If Tesla’s margins are similar, they will need to sell not the 500,000 vehicles per year that Musk is currently predicting by 2020, but four times that. Even if there is demand for millions of EVs, developing that capability will take years, and Tesla needs to finance these years.

Pulling off this strategy would be an amazing feat, requiring not only building sales and distribution capabilities, but also demand, even as existing companies produce cheaper EVs with similar capabilities. Given these risks, the probability of failure must be high. If the current price is correctly weighting this likelihood of failure, investors must believe that Tesla will sell several million cars annually in a market niche that has consistently underperformed projections.

It is possible that I am underestimating Tesla’s potential margins. If they were 25 percent, then perhaps the company’s current valuation could be justified. But 25 percent margins would be astounding in a hyper-competitive part of the market occupied by cost-conscious consumers where existing manufacturers can produce excellent cars with remarkable efficiency. But I forget: Tesla’s disrupting! Maybe I am thinking too conventionally. It seems unlikely that Tesla can outmaneuver existing firms in the efficiency of mass production, but they may do better in software, or batteries. So let’s consider these bets next.

The software bet

Perhaps the Silicon Valley-based Tesla will disrupt because the company perceives an increased role for software in automobiles — and will dominate that new breed of automobile with an innovative software platform. In this view, the secret sauce might be Tesla’s ability to update their cars over the air, much as the operating system in phones are updated — and thereby enhance their cars over time. The ability to integrate software into the car throughout the design and build process could be a capability that existing automobile makers will struggle to replicate.

But one still has to think of something this design can accomplish that will get customers to purchase Teslas and not other cars. I was going to get a $15,000 Ford, but instead I spent another $10,000 so that I can update my car’s OS over the air! Now that’s disruption! Tesla only has to develop one software platform for all of its cars, as, say, Apple produces one operating system for all of its computers. And maybe such a platform strategy will allow sufficient economies of scale to reduce the average cost of producing each automobile.

In turn, it might be the case that legacy manufacturers can’t mimic this strategy because their ossified structures will not allow software engineers to integrate well into the design process and the legacy companies are unable to change these structures. In this world, the same software is deployed across similar cars — like the Models S, X and 3 — lowering development costs enough to increase margins.

It’s difficult to measure if incumbents are struggling on this front. The Tesla Model S has 62 microprocessors. Luxury cars such as Mercedes have close to 100, and even compact economy cars have around 30. By this measure, however imperfect, there appears to be little evidence that automobile manufacturers have not invested heavily and developed capabilities in the automobile software.

Additionally, a software-based upgrade may improve the attractiveness and reliability of the end product if the upgrades generated a constantly improving driving experience. Tesla is already deploying the self-driving capability to existing owners over the air — in other words, a significant upgrade in capabilities after the car is purchased. This enhanced experience may be attractive enough to create a price premium.

This is much different than selling a car with a large screen in the middle to control the stereo; rather, it is way to sell luxury. Perhaps this would help Tesla convince consumers ready to purchase a decked-out Nissan Leaf to fork out the difference and purchase a Tesla. But this software strategy seems far-fetched, given that Tesla’s marketing so far has been about range, safety and cool — not over-the-air updates.

The autonomous-vehicle bet

One aspect of the software strategy is so important that it deserves its own separate category. Perhaps Tesla will win the autonomous vehicle race. Alphabet (a.k.a. Google) is famously in this space, and Intel just bought the Israeli startup MobileEye for $15 billion. Uber raided Carnegie Mellon to begin to develop this capability, and every major manufacturer is investing in automation technologies. This is a very competitive space. But it’s undeniable that Tesla is at the forefront of self-driving technology that’s already on the roads. Tesla is able to learn as the technology is used — and this may be Tesla’s secret sauce: the difficult-to-get information that is necessary to perfect autonomous vehicles.

Driving is one of the most dangerous activities most people do on a regular basis. The technological problem of building software and sensors that replicate what a good driver does is difficult — and based on understanding rare events. (One Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, thought the technology was more advanced than it was and died when his auto-piloted Model S failed to recognize a semi-trailer and his car slid under it.)

Of all of the theories involving Tesla and disruption, this is the most intriguing — and convincing: Tesla is the first to roll out an autonomous driving technology. Its use allows Tesla to learn and improve, leading to a technological leadership position. Since the technology relies on machine learning, and machine learning only gets better with more data, Tesla is then able to develop a leadership position that becomes difficult to assail — analogous to Google’s in search. Tesla is then able to monetize this dominant market position.

The trouble, once again, is that at least 33 other companies are also developing autonomous vehicle technology, and also gathering a great deal of data. Any successful strategy would require a quick rollout that would prevent competitors from catching up. Mercedes’ new models already have advanced driver assistance capabilities similar to Tesla’s. Cadillac is expected to deploy within months. But perhaps the software platform is integral to this. Perhaps the software bet blends with the autonomous-vehicle bet! Tesla recently showed off this capability when it curtailed some of the autopilot features of Teslas with a software update.

Such deep software integration may be something other car companies are unable to replicate. That is, Teslas will have constantly improving autonomous capabilities, while competitors will not — or they will require a visit to the shop to upgrade. But still, to beat out competitors Tesla would have to sell millions of such high-tech cars, not hundreds of thousands. Tesla’s production capabilities on this scale are unproven, which in turn makes it doubtful that they will be able to deploy the technology across a wide range of vehicles quickly —and that would leave room for competitors to move down the learning curve quickly.

Many industry observers, yours truly included, believe autonomous vehicles have the potential to be far more disruptive than EVs, because they upend the logic of automobile ownership. Most cars sit idle at least 20 hours a day, which is incredible wasteful. But if you could simply summon a private, robot car at will, utilization would increase. This, in turn, has the potential to make mobility much cheaper — it’s public transportation on steroids! The software-plus-autonomous vehicle advantage might then allow Tesla to build out this mobility service. The vehicle-on-demand model requires the ability to find efficient routes and optimize routes across vehicles. Which car will come to pick you up? How will it get from point A to point B.

Unfortunately for Tesla, however, Google, Lyft, and Uber have these capabilities already. And GM has partnered with Lyft — it’s hardly standing by idly.

Still, might this be the disruptive path that Tesla is on? Again, there’s a complication: All signs suggest that one thing people will want from their future on-demand autonomous vehicles is affordability. Uber and Lyft have taught us quite well that the sweet spot in this space is price; Uber-X is much more popular than Uber Black. So, as foreseen by Henry Ford more than 100 years ago, the market will most likely support a mobility solution that is based on fairly utilitarian cars. This implies an industrywide shift in hardware to the production of a glorified, but low-margin golf cart — and adopting Uber’s business model. The production of low-end, and hence low margin, utility vehicles is unlikely to lead to the margins necessary to support Tesla’s valuation. (Though perhaps they can make this up in selling rides, like Uber? Hope springs eternal!)

Elon Musk, however, may not believe in the glorified-golf-cart future that I’ve sketched out here. (Note that he only began to peddle the autonomous-vehicle disruption story as the EV disruption story became less plausible.) Does that mean Tesla’s bet is that autonomous vehicles will not only be electric, but moreover super-cool Teslas — as opposed to lower-end EVs, or even plain old hybrids? That outcome seems unlikely.

Alternatively, Tesla may demonstrate success in their EV vertical and then license their OS with self-driving capabilities — a Windows-Intel-type strategy that implies Tesla software in every automobile on the market. Thus, Tesla would effectively be taxing every automobile on the market. It would let other people build the golf carts, just as Microsoft leaves the low-margin computer business to others. If Musk pulls this off, then Tesla’s valuation is surely justified — and then some!

The problem is that Tesla’s automotive operating system lead — if extant at all — is slight, and its competitors are working hard on this front. So any valuation should take into account the most likely outcome of this play: again, failure.

The energy bet

The final possibility is that Tesla is making a play as an energy company. Musk bailed out Solar City, a solar panel installation company, in October. The economics of solar are marginal, unless home owners can sell excess electricity they produce back to the utility, an activity called “net metering.” Solar City was in distress, in part because utility companies convinced state regulators and governments to eliminate or reduce net metering, undermining its business model.

Musk was the largest shareholder in both firms before the acquisition (Solar City was founded by his first cousins), and now he sees Tesla and Solar City’s missions as dovetailing. For example, he suggested that customers might purchase solar panels from a Tesla store, and energy gathered during the day might be stored in a Tesla home battery back or “Powerwall” — a product introduced in March 2016. You could then power your dishwasher, or charge your Tesla car from your Powerwall overnight.

The home battery packs are still too expensive to justify home storage of excess electricity production, so sales are meager. But Tesla is introducing a new solar shingle this fall, because the main barrier to solar installation apparently is an aesthetic distaste for solar panels on the roof. So this is cool, but mainstream adoption of solar roofs make sense when they are cost competitive, and oil remains cheap.

The batteries are produced in Tesla’s audacious $5 billion “Gigafactory.” Musk and some business analysts have suggested that Tesla might, through this factory, lock down the supply of raw materials for lithium-ion batteries and produce better batteries, at less cost than competitors. This, in turn, might lead to better margins for their EVs. For example, in February Tesla announced that the Gigafactory will lead to a 35 percent reduction in per-car costs for the entry level Model 3 battery, cutting it from $10,500 to $6,875.

This would double Tesla’s margins if nobody else were making improvements to their batteries. But that’s not the case — note Nissan’s ability to double the Leaf’s range within five years while maintaining the same price point. A few points better on margins, thanks to battery technology, is not enough to assure market dominance. It’s difficult to justify high valuations when you’ve build your advantage on a commodity — in this case, a battery.

Call me skeptical. But no matter — Tesla’s disrupting.

The disruption fetish

A Google search for “disruption theory” produces almost the same amount of hits as “competitive advantage.” Impressive for a theory that suffers from vagueness and has a poor record in explaining outcomes. My objection is not that incumbents never fail — that would be absurd. My point is that this rarely happens because managers are not paying attention to the competition.

Incumbents fail when their resources and capabilities become obsolete and they are unable to develop new capabilities themselves at a reasonable cost, or to buy these capabilities. That is, to believe in the disruptive potential of a company, it is necessary to also explain not only why the firm’s technology will be successful, but also why the incumbents cannot compete. Not superficially, but through careful consideration of these capabilities for both potential disruptors and incumbents.

Musk is admirable, ambitious and courageous — there is little doubt that he has created a threat to which big car manufacturers must respond. And Tesla may become a profitable business. But to get from that observation to its current valuation — bigger than Ford? — requires a boatload of faith.

In addition to considering the fetishization of disruption theory, we have to venture into psychology to explain the company’s valuation. Consider: Tesla is the only remaining pure-play electric vehicle company. If an investor believes EVs are the future, Tesla is the only way to go. Investing in Nissan because of the Leaf is just not as satisfying.

Moreover, if you own a Tesla, you probably love your car and you are definitely rich. That means Tesla owners are likely to invest — and what better to invest in than something familiar that you know and love? Tesla owners get to feel good not only for driving an electric vehicle, Tesla stock owners get a double dose of smug for believing in the save-the-planet-electric-vehicle social movement — all the while rooting for the underdog.

Tesla stock is a social movement that Musk works hard to cultivate with his reality distortion field. As he has cycled through disruption stories, the reality distortion has worked well — at least for those who’ve drunk the Kool-Aid. But in the end, Musk has chosen a space with incumbents with strong capabilities, who, far from ignoring technological challenges, are racing to meet them. He cannot disrupt competitive reality.

Correction: This article originally misstated the number of cars Tesla sold in 2016. It is roughly 76,000 (not 64,000). And it costs $1,000 (not $2,000) to reserve a Model 3.

Tesla gets more than its fair share of media hype, but it appears to be stumbling in the spotlight.

Citing ""production bottlenecks,"" Tesla reported this week that it delivered only 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in September. That's far below some pretty ambitious goals set out by its CEO, Elon Musk.

The Model 3 is Tesla's attempt to enter the mainstream. The all-electric car, which began production in July, starts at $35,000. That price tag placed it well within the range of the average American new-car buyer. That's half the price of the Tesla Model S sedan. The Model 3 gets pricey quickly, with add-ons such as extra range and self-driving features.

For Musk, the Model 3 is not just Tesla's make-or-break car, it's the company's reason for being. The company predicted in previous months that it expected production to ""achieve a rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017."" Tesla predicted annual production would climb over the next few years to more than 500,000 vehicles. That ramp-up was expected to be difficult, but Musk said on said on Twitter that the company could smash through expectations.

Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino, who has been a Tesla skeptic, told CNBC that Tesla's miss is evidence that the electric car maker would have trouble getting to its own goals.

Launching a new car model is among the most sweated-over tasks for any automaker. But an analysis from Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas called for calm over the Tesla number, saying ""most auto launches have hiccups, and Tesla is no exception.""

Morgan Stanley and much of Wall Street don't see a lag for one month as hurting Tesla's financial liquidity or access to capital. During the quarter, deliveries of its other, more expensive vehicles — the Model S and Model X — were up 4.5 percent over a year earlier, Tesla said.

""It is important to emphasize that there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,"" Tesla said in a statement. ""We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near term.""

The company said a handful of systems at its Fremont, Calif., car plant and its battery factory in Reno, Nevada, ""have taken longer to activate than expected.""

""Elon Musk said it best himself — the Model 3 will put Tesla in 'manufacturing hell' for a while,"" says Akshay Anand, an executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. ""Producing a vehicle is one of the most complex tasks a company can take on, and something Tesla has dealt with before.""

Anand points out that one month does not make a trend. But, he says, ""If production misses continue into the fourth quarter and even beyond, Tesla will be in a much more precarious position.""

Anand says the company's future relies on the Model 3 being a success. ""They need to get it right, no to be too blunt,"" he says."

Through his massively profitable Tesla corporation, Elon Musk is planning to transform the world not just of motoring but also of power generation (the Gigafactory), space travel (SpaceX), tunnelling (the Boring Company) and even, possibly, time travel (Hyperloop One).

Musk has got an awful lot to do. So while we wait for him to sort it all out, here are 20 things – some good and some quite annoying – about his latest vehicle, the Model X, a futuristic but undeniably faddy family SUV.

1) The powerful electric engine is only about the size of a watermelon.



2) The vast touchscreen is 17in deep and is the biggest fitted in any car. It comes preloaded with Spotify.

3) The rear falcon doors are double hinged and need only 12in to open. They make it very easy to get in and out, especially if you are elderly or have to fit child seats. They are a great show-off feature, but their slow movement means they soon begin to irritate. They also mean you can’t fit a roof rack.

4) You can open or close all four doors by pressing a single button. They each sense obstacles and only open if safe to do so. A leafy bush fooled the system and left me trapped inside.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Inside story: the Model X comes as a five, six or seven seater

5) The lithium-ion battery pack weighs half a tonne. It looks like one giant battery, but it is made up of 18,650 regular AA-sized batteries.



6) The switchgear (indicator, windscreen control, gear stalk, etc) are from Mercedes-Benz. In the futuristic setting of a super posh Tesla they seem a bit flimsy.



7) Hidden within each car are endless digital Tesla teasers – small features designed to surprise and delight. For instance, you can set the autodrive display to look as if you are on Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road; you can switch the accelerator function from “sport” to “ludicrous”; the volume goes up to a Spinal Tap 11; and you can make the car do a sound and light show. But there’s a fine line between surprise and delight – and stale and a bit childish.



8) It takes 75 minutes to fully charge the Model X using a purpose-built supercharger, and costs about £9.

9) If you choose a destination beyond its range, the Model X plots a route to leapfrog from one charger to the next.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Up front: the huge windscreen of the Model X means the cabin is flooded with light. Note also the 17in touchscreen and digital dashboard

10) Car functionality is updated remotely – just like on a smartphone – with “constant air updates”.



11) The “Big Sky” windscreen is the largest single piece of glass on any production car on the road.



12) If you have the key fob in your pocket, the driver’s door will automatically open as you approach.



13) The central cubby is crappily finished and the lid doesn’t fit well.



14) The charge port is disguised as part of the rear light. It automatically opens when it detects the power hose.



15) You can close the driver’s door by putting your foot on the brake pedal.



16) Using an app on your phone you can check the battery charge, lock and unlock the doors, control the temperature, locate your car on Google Maps and even reverse the car in or out of a parking space while standing on the pavement.



17) The sun visors are tiny and don’t work. But they are magnetic.



18) If you indicate while cruising, the car will change lanes on its own.



19) There is a secret compartment under the front bumper to fool thieves hunting inside for precious things like wallets and purses. Though now they know…



20) A medical grade filter ensures the car is free from pollen, bacteria and pollution. There is also a bio-weapon defence mode that can totally seal the cabin.

Tesla Model 3 sedan. (Tesla Motors/AP)

After Elon Musk unveiled the Model 3 at Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., headquarters in July, the Tesla chief executive set an aggressive production schedule for his company’s first mass-market vehicle.

The goal, he said, was for Tesla to produce 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter, a sizable jump en route to increasing production to 20,000 vehicles per month by the end of the year.

But Monday, the company said that it had produced only 260 of the 1,500 intended sedans during that period. The company attributed that to production issues.

Tesla’s stock dropped by as much as 1.7 percent to $335.76 during after-trading hours.

“Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks,” Tesla wrote in an investor letter. “Although the vast majority of manufacturing subsystems at both our California car plant and our Nevada Gigafactory are able to operate at a high rate, a handful have taken longer to activate than expected.”

The company noted that there are “no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain.”

“We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term,” the letter added.

The low production numbers aren’t entirely surprising. During the Model 3’s rollout, Musk told the massive crowd of employees, media and company officials that Tesla was about to enter “production hell.”

“As the saying goes, if you’re going through hell, keep going!” he said.

During a second-quarter earnings call, Musk, seeking to downplay the importance of the production benchmarks, urged investors not to “get too caught up” in “calendar boundaries.”

Musk said Model 3 production would climb to 50,000 a month by the end of next year. It’s a steep increase in production — making 500,000 vehicles in a year, as Tesla has vowed to do, would mean increasing its 2016 production almost sixfold, Reuters noted at the time.

Production problems hampered the launches of Tesla’s Model S sedan and the Model X SUV and led to a decline in shipments on two occasions over the past year. But Tesla said in the investor letter Monday that their deliveries increased 4.5 percent compared with the same period last year.

Musk told Business Insider in July that the company has learned from the challenge of rolling out previous vehicles and has designed the Model 3 to be as minimalistic and easy to build as possible.

“We learned a significant amount of lessons with 3,” he said. “There’s nothing in that car that doesn’t need to be there. Everything has a compelling reason.”

The Model 3 — touted as the first “mass market” electric car — will start at $35,000, reach 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds and have a top speed of 130 mph.

A Model 3 with every premium option would cost about $60,000, according to the latest details released by the company. The car has a range of 220 to 310 miles.

When asked whether production delays led to any cancellations, Tesla pointed to Musk’s second-quarter statement noting that there have been 450,000 net reservations.

Of those produced, 220 were delivered. “Production bottlenecks” are to blame for the poor starting pace, according to Tesla, which says that “a handful” of manufacturing subsystems at both its California plant and Nevada Gigafactory “have taken longer to activate than expected.”

“It is important to emphasize that there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,” the company writes. “We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.”

“There are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain.”

The information comes from a report published today by Tesla that details its production and delivery numbers for all vehicles during the third quarter of 2017, which was otherwise a record-breaking one. Overall, Tesla delivered 26,150 vehicles — 14,065 of those were Model S, and 11,865 were Model X — which the company says was good enough to make it the “all-time best quarter” for both of those vehicles.

And while Tesla was under its own target of delivering 50,000 vehicles for the first half of the year, it says it expects to beat that number by “several thousand vehicles” in the second half, meaning it would deliver 100,000 Model S cars and Model X SUVs across all of 2017. Buzz from the release of the Model 3, as well as Musk’s attempts to shoo customers away from the waiting list (which is around a half a million people long) appear to be having an impact.

Attention will likely linger on the Model 3 production and delivery numbers until they come in line with the CEO’s expectations, though Musk has warned that they could be ugly at the outset. He even went so far as to say the company was entering “manufacturing hell” at the car’s launch.

Musk expects to ramp the production up rapidly to 10,000 Model 3s per week by the end of next year, and so he warned the company’s investors of fretting over early numbers when he spoke with them after last quarter’s results. “I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendar boundaries of a quarter, one quarter or the next, because when you have an exponentially growing production ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes,” he said."
https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/256907-teslas-trouble-model-3-production,pos,0.999999999999212,8.050192520457786e-13,Tesla’s Having Trouble With Model 3 Production,2017-10-03 15:50:33,2019-06-24 14:19:38.001274,Joel Hruska,"Tesla announced its quarterly production numbers yesterday and the news is mixed. First, the company managed to increase production of its Model S and Model X vehicles by 4.5 percent compared with last year. Its Model 3 production, however, was markedly below expectations. In Q3, Tesla built 25,390 Model S and Model X vehicles, and just 260 Model 3s. That’s a far cry from where Tesla wanted to be at this point in its ramp up.

Back in May, Tesla declared it wanted to be ramping up to 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of 2017 and up to 10,000 by the end of 2018. That first goal now looks unlikely. While it’s possible there’s a single component or critical failure point that’s holding total line production back, it’s more likely Tesla has been dealing with a range of issues. Ramping up vehicle production is difficult, which is one reason why so few major car companies have been successfully ramped to compete with the likes of Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler.

Tesla didn’t offer much commentary on its problems, saying that Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.

“It is important to emphasize that there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,” Tesla added. “We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.”

The company is working to resolve these production issues. Production delays are, of course, nothing new to Tesla: The Model S and Model X were both significantly delayed before they finally launched, and the Model 3 is likely no different in that respect. The tricky part will be ramping up production to the sheer number of cars that Musk wants to buy. At 5,000 vehicles per week, which was Musk’s target, Tesla would be delivering 60,000 Model 3s per quarter. Assuming that the company kept its 25,390 quarterly production rate on the Model X and Model S (just to simplify the math), that would add up to 85,390 cars, or ~3.4 times more than Tesla produces today. No matter what you think of Elon Musk and Tesla itself, tripling your rate of production over a single year is an extremely ambitious goal.

Goldman-Sachs responded to the news by predicting Tesla shares will drop 40 percent as a result of the Model 3 delay; Goldman analyst David Tamberrino raised his six-month price target a bit from $200 to $210. That’s a severe drop compared to the stock’s current value of $345. Investors don’t seem to have been phased by the latest news, but Tesla’s value has been criticized by some for being out of proportion to the number of vehicles it sells. Stock price analysis isn’t really ET’s game, but there’s a close intersection here between the technology Musk is deploying, the larger state of the BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) market, and how confident investors are in Tesla’s ability to execute its roadmap. After years of delays on other vehicles that ultimately resolved and led to higher sustained shipments, investors seem willing to ride out these issues on the Model 3 as well."

The actual number it built? 260, or 83% less than promised.

The announcement made late Monday is another sign of the challenges the upstart electric car maker may face as it tries to build a more affordable electric car -- a basic version of which priced at about $35,000.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell 1.5% in after-hours trading after the company released the news.

Tesla said most of the lines at the Gigafactory, its battery plant in Nevada, and its auto assembly plant in California were meeting their production targets, but that ""a handful have taken longer to activate than expected.""

""There are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 or the supply chain,"" the company said in its statement. ""We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.""

But the company did not give any new production targets to replace the earlier prediction that it would be making 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the year.

Tesla did not respond to a questions about a new production target.

Related: GM - The future is all-electric

""This should come as no surprise,"" said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader. ""This is the first volume vehicle they've ever produced. Making cars is not an easy business, and they're finding that out.""

But the Model 3 is not the first time it has fallen well behind promised production targets. Tesla's high-priced crossover, the Model X, went into production in late 2015, long after originally promised and had a slower-than-expected roll out. Production of the Model S sedan, its best selling vehicle to date, was also much slower than originally promised.

Krebs said Tesla missing deadlines is ""part of their track record.""

But Tesla said those problems are now well behind it, and the company said it had record production of both those luxury models in the third quarter -- building just over 25,000 of the two models in that quarter. It expects to deliver about 100,000 of those models in 2017.

The seats on Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) new Model X SUV were a mess. An outside contractor was having trouble executing the complicated design, spurring frustration and finger-pointing between Tesla and its supplier.

How would Tesla ever pull off mass production of the upcoming Model 3, the car intended to catapult the niche automaker into the big leagues, if it could not deliver on something as fundamental as a seat?

Musk made a decision: Tesla would build the seats itself.

Tesla’s demanding chief executive vowed years ago to shake up the automotive industry with his line of electric vehicles and a futuristic manufacturing facility in Fremont, Calif. But industry experts say Musk’s insistence on performing much of the work in-house is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its stated goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

The automaker this month revealed it built just 260 of the vehicles between July and September, badly missing its target of 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter. In a statement, Tesla blamed manufacturing “bottlenecks.” It declined to elaborate, but assured investors “there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain.”

Tesla has demonstrated a commitment to vertical integration not seen in the auto industry for decades.

The company has so far sunk $2 billion into a sprawling Nevada factory to manufacture its vehicles’ batteries. In-house programmers design the bulk of the complex software that runs the Model 3, which Musk has described as a “computer on wheels”. Tesla controls its own retail chain, selling its cars directly to customers and bypassing dealers.

But it is Tesla’s 2015 decision to build its own seats that has some industry veterans scratching their heads. Seat making is a low-margin, labor-intensive enterprise that big automakers generally farm out to specialists. Tesla is operating its own seat assembly line inside its factory, and it is hiring engineers and technicians to figure out a way to fully automate the process.

“Is that really the core competency of an auto company? It is not,” said analyst Maryann Keller, who has been tracking the car industry since the early 1970s. “Why would you want to do that?”

Tesla declined requests from Reuters to discuss its seat assembly efforts. The company is expected to reveal more about its production issues on Nov. 1, when it announces third-quarter results. There is no indication that the “bottlenecks” mentioned previously by the company are associated with seat production.

Analyst Keller and others suspect Tesla eventually will be forced to farm out seat assembly to suppliers as the company transitions from a niche producer of pricey, hand-built luxury cars to a mass manufacturer. Seat makers including Germany’s ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL], France’s Faurecia SA (EPED.PA) and Detroit-based Lear Corp (LEA.N) already are trying to win that business.

A lot is riding on Tesla’s ability to scale up operations quickly. Starting at $35,000, the Model 3 is Tesla’s attempt to bring its electric technology to a wider audience. More than a half-million customers have already put down deposits.

Tesla has never turned an annual profit and it is burning through cash. Yet investors are betting big on its future. It is now the second most valuable U.S. automaker, behind only General Motors Co (GM.N). Tesla shares on Wednesday closed at $325.84, down 3.4 percent.

FROM STOP-GAP TO STRATEGY

Musk has defended Tesla’s hands-on approach as the way to ensure reliability, as well as an opportunity to rethink industry norms.

It is also a reflection of the entrepreneur’s obsession with detail.

“One of the hardest things to design is a good seat,” Musk said at the September 2015 launch of the Model X in Fremont.

Problems first surfaced with the flagship Model S sedan in 2012. Musk complained that the seats made by its contract manufacturer, Australia-based Futuris Group, were not comfortable nor of the quality expected for a car whose price tag started at around $57,400, according to a former Tesla executive who described Musk’s thinking to Reuters.

Troubles accelerated with the Model X, leading Tesla to wrest assembly from Futuris just after the vehicle’s release in late 2015. If seats could be entirely redesigned from the ground up, Musk reasoned, maybe their assembly could be automated in preparation for the high volumes anticipated for the Model 3.

“He saw the opportunity to do it differently and better,” the former Tesla executive said. “The short term was a stop gap, but the long-term idea was to rethink the design of how a seat works to include how a seat is built.”

Futuris did not respond to requests for comment. It continues to supply seat parts to Tesla. Detroit-based seating supplier Adient PLC (ADNT.N) acquired Futuris for $360 million last month.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s seat woes continue. In all, the automaker has issued four seating-related recalls since 2013. The latest came this month with the recall of 11,000 Model Xs manufactured between Oct. 28, 2016 and Aug. 16, 2017.

SUPPLIERS CIRCLING

Making car seats is a complex business. Choosing materials, dying and cutting, shaping foam and metal frames, and adding heaters, recliners and other gadgets can involve nearly a dozen suppliers for top models. Final assembly requires lots of labor.

That’s why most automakers opted decades ago to outsource seats for their lower-cost models to specialty seatmakers whose market is expected to reach $79 billion by 2022, according to market researcher Lucintel.

Although Musk’s philosophy has always been “build it right and then figure out how to get the cost down” later, according to the ex-Tesla executive, observers say Tesla can ill afford more production headaches.

Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst with the investment bank Jefferies, wrote in a September note to clients that “scalability” was now the main challenge at Tesla, whose manufacturing prowess is still unproven when it comes to building large numbers of vehicles.

“We don’t think Tesla’s vertically integrated business model can be scaled up as profitably and quickly as consensus thinks,” Houchois wrote.

Despite Tesla’s previous battles with Futuris, seat suppliers smell opportunity. ZF Friedrichshafen and Faurecia have opened Silicon Valley labs, in part to woo Tesla.

Lear, which cuts and sews material for Tesla, is likewise pressing to get the automaker’s seat manufacturing business, according to Matthew Simoncini, the company’s chief executive.

“In general Tesla has a philosophy: ‘We’ll do it ourselves. We’ll change the mold,’” Simoncini said. “(Outsourcing)is a much more efficient use of capital. That would allow them to focus on what they do best.”"

Frank,"As psychologists have long known, sounds that reach our ears provoke at least a weak valence — an emotional reaction to their intrinsic attractiveness or unpleasantness. “Puppy” evokes a positive valence, for example, while “snake” evokes a negative one.

Psychologists also explain that once we’ve experienced an initial valence, we activate a cognitive filter that tends to reinforce that assessment. If we react negatively upon first meeting someone, for instance, we tend to interpret ambiguous signals received during further interactions with that person as confirming our initial appraisal.

Is discrimination good or bad? For most people, the term evokes a strong negative valence. Any action bearing the label “discrimination” is destined to be viewed with initial skepticism — and with increasing disdain as time passes. That’s unfortunate in this case, because the consequences of Tesla’s pricing practices are completely benign.

In fact, companies like Tesla are practicing what might better be called the hurdle method of differential pricing. Under this method, sellers offer buyers a choice: They can buy the product at list price without further ado, or they can jump over some hurdle to be eligible for a significant discount.

Want a new stove? You can wait for the scratch-and-dent sales that occur periodically, or you can buy one right away at list price. A new blender? You can pay sticker price, or get a nice discount by mailing in a rebate coupon. In Tesla’s case, you could pay list price for an unrestricted car, or pay substantially less by tolerating the shorter range of a restricted model.

From the seller’s perspective, the ideal hurdle is one that only price-sensitive buyers are willing to jump. Such hurdles enable sellers to expand their sales by offering significant discounts without having to cut prices for everyone. Once you’ve spotted a few examples of the hurdle method in action, you will see it everywhere. You may even have trouble finding sellers who do not engage in some variant of the practice.

Because production is increasingly accompanied by large fixed research and development costs, differential pricing is becoming increasingly important. As the Duke University economist Philip Cook and I wrote in our 1995 book, “The Winner-Take-All Society,” roughly 80 percent of the cost of a computer in 1984 was in its hardware, and 20 percent in its software. Only six years later, that proportion was reversed, and this trend has intensified sharply since then."

Tesla said Friday that the dismissals were not out of the ordinary, even though they came as the automaker tries to increase the production of its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3 sedan.

The company has been criticized for the slow pace of its early production of the new model, which has generated hundreds of thousands of deposits from prospective buyers.

Tesla built about 25,000 vehicles in the three months that ended Sept. 30, but only 260 of those were Model 3s — considerably fewer than the 1,500 it had projected. The automaker has attributed the low production rate of the new car to unexpected bottlenecks in its manufacturing system."

The zero-emission vehicles make up almost 30% of the total market. But now, the government is putting the brakes on some of the subsidies that revved up this market. A proposal, presented as part of next year’s budget, has been put forward to remove a tax exemption on electric vehicles that weigh more than two metric tons.

The move has been dubbed the “Tesla tax,” as it’s most likely to effect the American company’s models, particularly the Tesla Model X, an SUV. There are more than 13,000 registered Teslas in Norway, according to data from the national statistics office. The tax would increase the cost of buying a new Tesla X by about 70,000 kroner ($8,850), local media said (link in Norwegian).

Norway’s finance minister, Siv Jensen, justified the proposal by arguing that the heavy cars caused as much damage to the road as gasoline and diesel cars, so electric-car owners should contribute more to the cost of upkeep. Still, owners of Teslas and other electric cars would still benefit heavily compared to other vehicle owners.

The Scandinavian country has an ambitious target for new vehicles sales to be exclusively zero-emission models by 2025. Countries like France and the UK hope to achieve the same by 2040. Over the years, Norway has offered enticing subsides and other perks to encourage people to buy electric cars, such as no city tolls, free parking, free charging, and permission to drive in bus lanes. In February, the number of electric cars in Norway surpassed 100,000.

The Norwegian government has been considering ways to curb the incentives for a while, amid criticisms that the perks allow rich households to buy pricey Teslas cheaply and significantly increase congestion in the capital, Oslo. However, the traditional center-right allies of the current government have spoken out against the Tesla tax, because the subsidies had been agreed to run through 2020, according to AFP."

Citing interviews with former and current employees, the report puts the firings at between 400 and 700 people, and they affected everything from factory workers to engineers to managers. According to The Mercury News, workers were not given advance notice of the decision.

Tesla, in a statement, cited a company-wide annual review and said that it had not laid employees off, but rather that it let employees go based on lackluster job performance. “As with any company, especially one of over 33,000 employees, performance reviews also occasionally result in employee departures,” a company spokesman told The Mercury News. “Tesla is continuing to grow and hire new employees around the world.” Tesla says it plans on filling a “vast majority” of the vacancies with new hires.

Tesla claims most of the employees let go were in sales and administration, and that the firings will have little effect on the roughly 10,000-strong factory workforce in Fremont. Still, Tesla is currently behind on production of its Model 3 sedan. CEO Elon Musk decided to delay the announcement of Tesla’s new Semi truck product to November to focus on getting the Model 3, which is Tesla’s most affordable and mass market car, out the door. More than half a million people are currently on the waiting list for the Model 3, which starts at $35,000.

In a report issued last week, Tesla said it had only delivered 220 Model 3s out of 260 produced, putting the company far behind the 1,600-unit benchmark Musk had set forth back in July. Tesla, which cited “production bottlenecks” for coming in under its target, has an ultimate goal of ramping up production to 10,000 vehicles per week by the end of next year. Yet a damning Wall Street Journal report that same week said Tesla factory workers were making parts of the Model 3 by hand because the assembly line is not yet fully operational.

It’s unclear how the firings will affect Tesla’s ability to produce more of Model 3s, and the number of factory workers affected could very well be small. But hundreds of employees now gone certainly doesn’t appear like it will help."

Tesla owners who were in Hurricane Irma's path in the Southeast recently got an unexpected boost to help them, after the carmaker remotely upgraded vehicle batteries to their highest capacity.

The boost gave customers' cars an extra 30 to 40 miles, but it's also temporary: The batteries will lose their extra juice this weekend.

The move came at the request of a customer who was worried about traffic and the range between charging stations during a massive evacuation that saw millions of Americans leave their homes in Florida, Georgia and neighboring states.

The battery boost applies to Model S and Model X vehicles that were built and sold with 75 kWh battery packs — but were software-limited to 60 kWh or 70 kWh capacities. Customers who bought the cars got them at a lower price, with an offer of paying to unlock the remaining battery power later.

News of the upgrade emerged Saturday, as Florida residents made their final preparations for Hurricane Irma, which hit the state as a Category 4 storm Sunday morning.

""There are a lot Tesla owners in Florida and they are also escaping north using the Supercharger network,"" Fred Lambert wrote for Electrek. ""Now Tesla has even facilitated travels for some of them as the automaker remotely unlocked the full battery pack capacity of Model S/X 60/60D vehicles with 75 kWh battery packs.""

The news prompted a number of questions, including: How can Tesla unilaterally (and remotely) boost battery power? And: Should car companies change vehicles unilaterally after they're sold?

After they're sold, Tesla cars stay in touch with the company's network, and the vehicles get a free software upgrade every few months. In August, for instance, new Model S and Model X 75 kWh vehicles got an over-the-air update that increased not their batteries, but their performance — allowing them to shave a full second of their zero-to-60-mph times.

In the battery boost, the range of Tesla's Model S 60 was increased from 210 miles to 249 miles, for instance, and the Model X 60D could travel 237 miles on one charge, rather than its standard 200 miles.

Tesla's use of over-the-air software updates was initially meant as a way for the company to offer content, such as streaming music or maps, to drivers. That's what NPR's Aarti Shahani found out in 2015, when she reported on hackers who were able to infiltrate the cars' network (and shut a car down). The company then used auto-updates to fix the vulnerability.

Science writer Brian Fung of The Washington Post called the temporary battery boost ""an example of the perks — and tyranny — of software in cars.""

The tyranny, Fung and other observers say, comes in the ability to change the terms of what a consumer has bought. When cars are remotely updated like a cellphone or other device — and without a customer's consent — problems can arise.

David Friedman, the director of cars and product policy and analysis at Consumers Union, says Tesla is ""really a great example"" of a carmaker that can give to customers with one hand while removing features with the other.

""This is a case where they gave consumers the ability to get greater range, but we also just heard this week that Tesla took away automatic emergency braking, at least temporarily, as a feature for some of the cars,"" Friedman says. ""So, there's sadly two sides to this.""

The former interim head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Friedman now works for the policy arm of Consumer Reports. This week, the site published a story about Tesla disabling AEB systems on recently manufactured cars — that had the feature as standard equipment when they were purchased.

Friedman says he's not trying to criticize Tesla for helping its customers get out of the way of a deadly hurricane. And he says electric and hybrid vehicles have proved their worth after natural disasters — serving as backup power sources, for instance.

Still, Friedman says, ""It's important for government to have a clear role in pushing automakers to provide consumers with clarity on what their cars can and can't do, and to not allow car companies to at a whim change the functionality of a vehicle, especially if safety is involved.""

More questions arise, he says, when it comes to how companies communicate changes to a car's capabilities.

""Maybe they notify the owner, but what about the owner's spouse, or child, or friend who borrows the car?"" Friedman asks. ""Or what if it's a company car? It creates some uncertainty.""

Like phones, modern cars have increasingly become mobile computers. But as Friedman notes, when your phone crashes, it usually has less disastrous consequences than does your car crashing.

Friedman says, ""I do worry that some companies are being a little too cavalier when it comes to trying to apply the Silicon Valley software model to 2 tons of glass, metal and plastic that can cruise down the road at 70 miles an hour."""
https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/31/16069960/tesla-model-3-not-luxury-car-options-model-s,pos,0.8288986154890029,0.1711013845109689,"Tesla’s Model 3 isn’t a luxury car, but it’s priced like one",2017-07-31 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:19:48.712876,Jul,"The big number surrounding Tesla’s Model 3 has been $35,000, which is the base price for the electric car. But there’s one big problem: barely anyone will pay that price, if they want a Model 3 with autopilot (which, let’s face it you do), or even a color other than black, according to screenshots of the Model 3 configurator posted in the Model 3 Owners Club.

The truth is the Model 3 costs $40,000 if you want a standard version with autopilot (an extra $5,000) in black with no other options. If you want a different color, add $1,000. And if you want a longer range ($9,000) to get over 300 miles per charge instead of 220, well now we’re at $50,000.

$50,000 for a midrange car.

If you’re new to cars, that isn’t exactly midrange car pricing, having clearly pushed into luxury sedan territory, with the likes of the Volvo S90 ($46,950) and Lexus GS ($46,310) and the Audi A6 ($47,600). Even the Model 3’s direct competition, the BMW 320i, maxes out at $47,175. And again, this is before adding the usual slate of premium options like leather seats, power adjustable seats and power folding side mirrors, and rear USB ports (another $5,000).

So if you’re about to drop at least $50,000 on a Model 3, does it qualify as a luxury car? For most people, no. Not unless you’re willing to spend closer to $60,000 (and at these prices, you’ve reached BMW 5 Series and Mercedes E-Class territory). If you’re willing to spend that much, then there is no issue for you. But if you thought spending the $35,000 would net you a car comparable to a BMW 3 Series, well, it really won’t.

How does the Model 3 stack up against the Model S and Chevy Bolt? The Model 3 might not measure favorably up against the tried and true luxury sedans from the likes of BMW and Mercedes. So how does it fare compared to the other leading electric vehicles like the Model S and Chevy Bolt?

If you purchase a standard Tesla Model 3, the seats must be manually adjusted, as will the steering column. The side mirrors aren’t powered or heated, and there’s no auto dimming. There are no LED fog lamps, and if you want a covered storage area in the center console, you must pay extra. Unless you spend $5,000 for the Premium Upgrade, you’re essentially getting the interior of a base model Toyota Camry. (To be fair, the Camry comes standard with a covered center console.)

If you’re looking for what you’ve seen in the Model S — a premium interior, autopilot, and around 300 miles of range in a color of your choosing — in a smaller form factor, well you’re not getting out without paying at least $55,000. That will be fine for some people, but I doubt the 500,000 people who put down $1,000 to reserve a Model 3 expected the price to increase by $20,000 to reach that mark.

This may be a product of uncontrolled hype, Tesla not doing enough to clarify what the Model 3 would be, or the company going too far to meet that $35,000 benchmark, but it wouldn’t surprise me if regular people get sticker shock once Tesla publicly releases the Model 3 configurator online.

The Tesla Model 3 isn’t a luxury car, it’s a midsized car masquerading as one. If you’re in the market for just another car in your price range, the Model 3 may not be for you. But if you’re looking for a smaller Model S, or the electric car of the future, you’ve found it. Just know it’ll cost a lot more than $35,000."

At a base price of $35,000, it brings many of the same features from the company's expensive luxury vehicles to a more affordable version.

Most experts believe the $35,000 price is going to make the Model 3 a mass-market success, and early sales numbers indicate it's well on its way. Tesla has already sold 500,000 deposits at $1,000 a piece since last year, according to Bloomberg.

But the truth is a $35,000 base model isn't packed with all the fun options that you'd expect to get from a Tesla vehicle. Features like the self-driving ""autopilot"" software, all-wheel drive, and a larger battery will add literally thousands of dollars to the total cost. Plus, when you add in extra fees like the home charger installation — things get even murkier.

With this in mind, we've decided to take a much closer look at the numbers and figure out exactly what people are getting for their money. So, without further adieu, here is what buying a Model 3 is actually going to cost you.

Everything in the base model

The base price Model 3 sells for $35,000 and comes with a standard battery that provides about 220 miles of driving per charge. The car itself can hit 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, which technically isn't as fast as the 2.8 seconds it takes the Tesla Model S in ""Ludicrous Mode,"" but should be plenty of power for most drivers.

The car's top speed is a respectable 130 mph, and the interior is decked out with basic textile seating and a gigantic 15-inch touchscreen control console. The base model also includes keyless entry and control from the Tesla app or an NFC-enabled card.

Admittedly, this is a lot of technology packed into the base model of a new car, but since this is a Tesla, it still leaves a lot to be desired.

Notably absent here are the extra bells and whistles like Autopilot that make Teslas some of the most exciting cars on the road. As is true with most modern vehicles, you'll have to spend a ton of money to get some of the more interesting features.

Extras cost thousands more

The price tag starts ballooning once you start adding the optional upgrades. The first uptick in price comes if you want your new car in any other color than black. That'll run you an extra $1,000 for any of the other five, raising the total to $36,000.

You can also upgrade to the $9,000 Long Range battery package, which pushes the capacity up to 310 miles per charge.

Charging is also faster on the Long Range battery, clocking in at 170 miles per 30 minutes at a Supercharger station and 37 miles per hour with a 240V outlet, 40A home charging setup.

The Long Range battery package also makes the car faster, cutting the 0 to 60 time to 5.1 seconds and bumping the top speed to 140 mph. But all of these improvements will cost you more. The better battery package will bring you up to $45,000.

Tesla's Autopilot feature is one of the brand's most wanted upgrades, as Elon Musk has claimed the current hardware package will be capable of full autonomy once the software catches up. Model 3 buyers might not be tempted by upgrades that are purely aesthetic, but the potential for a self-driving car could be more appealing.

The Enhanced Autopilot Package, which currently offers semi-autonomous capabilities, costs an extra $5,000, so that would bring the car up to the $50,000 mark. Full Self-Driving Capability, which isn't even functional at launch with no definite timeframe for activation, is an extra $3,000 on top of that. Your self-driving, long range, non-black Model 3 is now $53,000.

Thrifty customers might be more likely to resist the temptation for the 19-inch sport wheels and the Premium Upgrade Package for the Model 3's interior, but those options are also available. Tack on $1,500 for the wheels, and $5,000 for the luxe interior. A fully-loaded Model 3 goes for $59,500 before tax and title.

Home charging will also cost more

The most difficult cost to estimate for the Model 3 is also one of the most essential: how much will you pay to power your vehicle. Tesla has a few calculator tools that estimate savings compared to gasoline, but the company has casually avoided the fact that most people will need a new, special outlet installed into their homes or garages.

The Tesla Model 3 can technically charge from a standard 120v outlet using an adapter, but it barely gets any fuel that way. Tesla recommends that its customers install a 240v outlet in their homes instead, which can become a complicated process, depending on the setup.

New Model 3 owners will have to hire a licensed electrician (Tesla offers a database of specially trained professionals for the job), so the cost varies depending on who you call for the job. It ultimately depends on any number of factors, including potential service panel upgrades, home improvements to make room for the system, and relevant permit and inspection fees.

Tesla claims the costs might range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, and enthusiastic owners on web forums mostly agree, with the lowest reported estimates for the job coming in around $350 and the highest up to $7,000.

Tesla also sells a line of Wall Connectors for home charging starting at $500. They're not required, but make it easier for people to manage the entire installation process. Although installations can vary widely, our local Tesla shop told us that installing one of the Wall Connectors will likely run new owners about $1,500.

Charging on the road

Charging outside the home might also add to the long-term cost of the Model 3. Tesla once offered free use of its Supercharger network to all owners, but now there are some fees for vehicles ordered after January 15, 2017.

New Model S and X owners are given 400 kWh's worth of Supercharging credits (roughly 1,000 miles) every year for free charging. The Model 3 owners won't be given any credits, so drivers will have to pay for their Supercharging power when they use public chargers.

Rates to charge vary by region, so you can check out your state's estimated cost here. Tesla's calculation tool projects that an extra 1,500 miles driven on a Supercharger will cost drivers about $90.

There are other public EV charging locations out there, too. Tesla has its Destination Charging option, and third-party providers like ChargePoint offer public stations with partner businesses, which expand the network even wider. Some of those locations even offer free charging, but ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano told Mashable that drivers who depend on their public power stations will pay about $539 annually, or about $45 per month at most.

There are other unique factors at play — chiefly Supercharger and body shop expansion and delayed and costly repair concerns — that make buying a Tesla different than any other car on the road.

Tax credit benefit

Tesla and other EV companies have long touted the federal (and in some areas, state) tax credits available for consumers as an incentive to buy their electric cars. The federal tax credit, which has been available since 2010, knocks an extra $7,500 off a car's starting price once applied. Model 3 buyers who qualify can actually depend on a lower cost before tax and title and other incentives: $27,500.

That tax credit might not be available for many prospective Model 3 owners by the time their car is ready for purchase, however. The IRS code stipulates that the credit can only be applied while an automaker has sold fewer than 200,000 qualifying vehicles in the U.S. Tesla's eligibility is dwindling, according to a market estimate by Edmunds that was reported by CNBC.

Tesla is down to about 79,000 credits, according to Edmunds. That's no small number of vehicles — but Elon Musk's bold manufacturing plan calls for the automaker to pump out 20,000 Model 3s per month by December, and 50,000 per month by the end of 2018. That ramped up production is justified in order to catch up with the total of Model 3 reservations, of which there were roughly 400,000. The credit will likely be maxed out soon in the Model 3's release timeline.

The credit has a year-long phase out period that begins in the first two calendar quarters after exceeding the limit, cutting the incentive in half to $3,750, then in half again for the following two quarters to $1,875.

That means some drivers hoping for an even less expensive shot at the Tesla experience will likely wind up out of luck. So, in short, you should definitely consider all of the upgrades — and especially the cost of installing a home charger — before you finally decide plunk down the money for a brand new Tesla Model 3."

So if you’re thinking, “Time to finally write the check and go all-in on Elon's electric,” you're likely also wondering, ""When can I get mine?"" The quick answer: not for a while.

Thanks to massive pent-up demand for this long-range and (relatively) low-cost electric, if you place a reservation right now, you’re looking at mid to late 2018 for delivery. And even if you threw your $1,000 deposit at Tesla the day the car was revealed in March 2016, to get your name near the front of the line it’ll still be a few months yet.

After all, Tesla has to successfully ramp up its production line. Then it has to work through the backlog of half a million reservations it had booked as of last week.

The good news is that, if you just cannot wait that long, there are a few ways to bump your order up in the line. Based on past Tesla prognostications and its just-launched “delivery estimator,” which offers a due date within a three month-ish window for your particular order, you can see some of the factors Tesla is using to allocate cars.

Wired

Your best bet is also the hardest to pull off: Work for Elon Musk. The first Model 3 deliveries are going to Tesla and SpaceX employees who made reservations. That’s not just special treatment, it’s a smart move for Tesla. The early cars off the line are almost guaranteed to have some bugs. Staff are more likely to be forgiving and better able to bring their cars in for service and repair.

Easier, but more expensive: Buy a Model S or Model X, or already have one in your garage. Previous owners jump ahead in the queue, as a thank you for their loyalty.

More complicated, and probably more expensive: relocate. Tesla will hand over Model 3 keycards (no keys here) with geographic filters of a sort. Deliveries will start in the US, then other left-hand drive countries. Right-hand drivers in places like the UK and Australia will have to wait until 2019.

OK, none of that’s super helpful. More practically, you can be flexible about the spec of your car—and how much you're willing to spend.

To keep things simple on the production line, Tesla is only building the long-range (310 miles) version of the Model 3 to start, and only with the top-spec upgrades, including a glass roof and better sound system. That bumps the price up to $49,000, but these models should ship to nonemployees in October.

The more basic 220-mile-range car will follow by November, for that promised $35,000 starting price. Sometime this fall Tesla also plans to introduce options like a white interior, instead of the standard black. The popular all-wheel-drive version, which uses two motors, one in the front and one in the back, will follow in the spring of 2018. There’s no word yet on a performance model, but it’s a safe bet that Tesla will make one eventually, and it will come at a price premium.

All of which is to say, if you want your car sooner rather than later, get the long-range version, spring for the fancy features, skip the white interior, and make do with rear-wheel-drive.

Celebrating the launch of the Model 3 last week, Musk took pains to thank potential buyers for their patience and described the path to production as an S curve. If you plot the number of brand new cars produced on the Y axis of a graph and time on the X axis, the result isn’t a straight line. Production starts very slowly because engineers are still finding and fixing bugs. Once most problems are figured out, output shoots up almost exponentially, before finally flattening off and chugging along at a steady pace.

Musk says this pattern makes it impossible to give completely accurate predictions, as a small move along the time axis can mean a large leap in production or hardly any change at all. ""Welcome to production hell,"" Musk told his employees at the launch, expecting at least six months of problems, issues, and stress before things settle down.

The good news is that every day you wait to see your Model 3 park itself in your driveway is another day Tesla has to find and kill bugs, and hopefully deliver you the car you've really been waiting for."

Johnson + Min Read,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N has reserved 100 of Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) new electric Semi trucks, the largest known order of the big rig, as the maker of Mountain Dew soda and Doritos chips seeks to reduce fuel costs and fleet emissions, a company executive said on Tuesday.

Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks.

Several transportation firms are holding off on the Tesla for now, citing uncertainty over the time it takes to recharge compared to a diesel fill-up, range, and payload capabilities and how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop.

About 260,000 heavy-duty Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, according to FTR, an industry economics research firm.

Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) and Volkswagen AG’s Truck and Bus are working to launch an electric medium duty truck by late 2019, while rival Daimler AG has delivered the first of a smaller range of electric trucks to customers in New York.

PepsiCo’s 100 trucks add to orders by more than a dozen companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc (JBHT.O), and food service distribution company Sysco Corp (SYY.N). Tesla has at least 285 truck reservations in hand, according to a Reuters tally.

PepsiCo intends to deploy Tesla Semis for shipments of snack foods and beverages between manufacturing and distribution facilities and direct to retailers within the 500-mile (800-km) range promised by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.

The semi-trucks will complement PepsiCo’s U.S. fleet of nearly 10,000 big rigs and are a key part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by a total of at least 20 percent by 2030, said Mike O’Connell, senior director of North American supply chain for PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay.

PepsiCo is analyzing what routes are best for its Tesla trucks but sees a wide range of uses for lighter loads like snacks or shorter shipments of heavier beverages, O’Connell said.

Tesla declined to comment on its customers and potential customers to date.

Tesla unveiled the Semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.

O’Connell declined to say how much PepsiCo paid to reserve its trucks, when it placed the order, or whether it plans to lease the trucks or buy them outright. Tesla initially asked $5,000 per truck for pre-orders but that amount has since risen to about $20,000."

“What happened was the company was going out of business and I was at dinner with him,” Calacanis told technology roundup show This Week in Tech (TwiT) during a 2015 interview. The dinner took place in Los Angeles at a time “when all the trade pubs were saying ‘hey, he’s got two weeks or three weeks worth of payroll,'” Calacanis told TWiT:

So we’re out at dinner just the two of us in LA, and I was like, well certainly there’s some good news. And he’s like, well, I blew up the second rocket. I said, what happens if you blow up the third rocket? He goes, SpaceX is done. I said, well, how are you doing personally? He was getting divorced from his first wife at that time and I said certainly there must be some good news. Tell me something good that’s going on. And he took out his blackberry—that’s how old it was—and he said, well, don’t tell anybody, but here’s the clay model of the Model S. And he showed me the clay model of the sedan. And I said wow, that’s gorgeous, what do you think you can get it for? And he said, well don’t tell anybody, but I think I can make this for 50 grand. So I went home and I wrote two checks for $50,000 and I put them in a FedEx envelope and I said, ‘E: Looks like a great car. I’ll take two.’

Calacanis made his first real money selling Weblogs, Inc., a blogging company he co-founded, to AOL for $25 million in 2005. Since then he has become a prominent Silicon Valley angel investor, most famously making an early bet on Uber. After he wrote the pair of checks to Musk following that dinner, Calacanis said he told his wife, “We’re never going to see this, this is going to pay for, like, a couple days of payroll. Tesla’s going out of business, but I have to support my friend.”

Two years later, his checks were cashed. “It said, congratulations, your serial number reservation is 00001 and 000073,” Calacanis told TWiT. “I forwarded it to Elon and I was like, Elon, you don’t have to give me the first one. And he goes, I want you to have it, you ordered it before anybody, you deserve it.” The car arrived in 2012.

Calacanis told TWiT he’s been offered $250,000 from a collector for the Tesla Model S, serial number 00001 and has thought of donating it to the Smithsonian or another museum. When Quartz followed up with Calacanis about his plans, he said, “If E wants the car he can have it, i might donate it to a museum at some point.” He added that he has no. 16 of the Roadster, Tesla’s battery-electric sports car, and is getting a “founder series of the Model 3” this week."

But it is less widely known that the car was named for Nikola Tesla, an electrical engineer who was once renowned as the prototype of a genius inventor.

While Tesla’s star began to fade long ago, Elon Musk has contributed to something of a Nikola Tesla revival.

In the age of Edison, Westinghouse, Marconi and J. P. Morgan, Tesla was a giant of innovation because of his contributions in the fields of electricity, radio and robotics.

“It’s a sociological fact that Elon Musk took the Tesla name and launched Nikola Tesla into the stratosphere,” says Marc Seifer, the author of “Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla.” “Tesla’s risen to the surface again, and now he’s getting his due.”"

But when will it hit?,2017-06-07 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:19:54.844072,Matt Egan,"ExxonMobil executives would be wise to worry about the explosive growth of Tesla, which this year surpassed both Ford and General Motors as America's most valuable car maker.

Tesla (TSLA) literally can't make its Model 3 mass market car fast enough to meet the enormous demand for electric cars. The stunning rise of Tesla -- and growing popularity of electric vehicles broadly -- poses a glaring problem for the oil industry.

Consider that nearly half (45%) of America's massive appetite for crude oil comes from passenger vehicles. That means each Tesla or Chevy Bolt sold knocks out one of Big Oil's best and most-reliable customer.

All of this combined with great strides in fuel-efficient cars has led oil execs to contemplate what was once-unthinkable: global oil demand could hit a peak.

""We will see peak oil. The question is: When?"" said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones.

It's undeniable that electric cars have serious momentum. The number of electric vehicles surpassed 2 million in 2016, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, published on Wednesday. And major auto makers like Volkswagen, Ford (F) and Honda have announced ambitious goals to sell more and more electric cars.

But how many people do you know who own an electric car? Probably not many.

Electric vehicles only represented 0.2% of total light-duty vehicles on the road in 2016, the IEA said. Red-hot growth has also cooled a bit. Last year was the first time since 2010 that electric car sales growth dipped below 50%.

""The scale achieved so far is still small,"" the IEA said.

That's why the IEA concluded that electric vehicles ""still have a long way to go"" before reaching the scale needed to make a ""significant dent"" in global oil demand and greenhouse gas emissions.

Related: Elon Musk to Trump: You quit Paris, so I quit you

Consider these predictions from Morgan Stanley, a big believer in the potential of electric cars.

The investment bank predicted in a recent report that electric vehicles could account for an incredible 50% to 60% of global light vehicle sales by 2040. A world of ""shared, autonomous and electric transport is coming,"" Morgan Stanley analysts led by Adam Jonas wrote.

Yet the firm said it's ""surprisingly constructive"" on oil demand, at least relative to the pessimistic views that have become more popular recently.

Why? The popularity of electric, self-driving and shared cars will make it much cheaper to get around in the future, causing the number of global miles traveled to double by 2030 and triple by 2040. That, of course, would ease the pressure on oil demand.

""We believe the 'peak oil demand' thesis has a very large blind spot on miles traveled,"" Morgan Stanley wrote.

For its part, the oil industry is more focused these days on the appetite for oil from fast-growing economies like India and China. The thinking is that greater consumption in developing countries may offset weakening demand from the U.S. and Europe.

""That's where oil demand will come from in the future,"" said Youngberg of Edward Jones.

It's also worth noting that the biggest energy companies like Exxon (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have already diversified business models that allow them to hedge their bets a bit. A great deal of their business comes from natural gas, which helps power the power grid that electric cars tap into.

Exxon addressed the issue of electric cars in its long-term energy outlook report. Not surprisingly Exxon is more cautious on the future of electric cars, predicting they will only account for more than 10% of new car sales in the U.S. by 2040. Exxon also expects that oil and natural gas will still be the leading suppliers of global energy by 2040.

Yet even Exxon admits that new technologies and greater fuel efficiency will lead vehicle energy demand to ""peak and eventually decline.""

Of course, long-term predictions are inherently hard to make.

One key question: how will the U.S. and other nations encourage the adoption of electric vehicles as a way to reduce carbon emissions? That mystery deepened last week when President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.

The future of electric cars also depends greatly on how fast Tesla and others can get the cost of the vehicles and battery storage down.

""Five years ago, we weren't really talking about Tesla. So, who knows what we're talking about in five or 10 years from now,"" said Youngberg."

For the second year in a row, Elon Musk used the Tesla shareholder meeting Tuesday as a platform to confess the errors his electric car and energy company had committed in the past—and how he planned to avoid them in the future.

Tesla (tsla) is on track to deliver the first orders of its Model 3 lower-priced sedan in July, but customers should not expect to have as many bell-and-whistle options to choose from as were available with previous Tesla cars. In fact, Model 3 buyers will only have two options for customizing the car at first: the color and the size of the wheels, Musk said.

The CEO said he made the decision to significantly pare down the configurations for the Model 3—Tesla’s most affordable vehicle yet, starting at $35,000—after learning from mistakes he made with Tesla’s SUV known as the Model X, which Musk called “hubris extraordinaire.”

“The big mistake we made with the X, which primarily was my responsibility, was having way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish,” Musk said.

“It had way too many cool things in it that really should have been rolled in with version 2, version 3,” he continued. “We got overconfident and created something great that probably will never be made again, and perhaps should not be.”

Meanwhile, the rollout of the Model S, which came with just one configuration when production began, had been smoother, Musk recalled—though he said it had not been a strategic decision, but rather all Tesla was capable of delivering at the time.

Learning from that experience, Musk had initially considered offering a dual motor for all-wheel drive as opposed to just a single motor on the Model 3, but decided against it because it would have “doubled the probability of something going wrong,” he said. (“We’ll get to the other configurations later, as soon as we get configuration one right,” he added, noting that he expects to be able to offer the dual motor by the end of 2017 or early 2018.) Likewise, Musk is also aiming to simplify Tesla’s supply chain so that it is not so widely spread across the globe, which exposes it to “so much risk from earth.”

Another misstep Tesla made was building the Model X SUV too much in the image of the Model S sedan, when the company should have started from scratch to avoid stumbling blocks in the design process.

“We made a mistake in trying to derive the Model X from the Model S platform—it would have been better to just design an SUV the way an SUV should be designed,” Musk said. “Otherwise, you just try to shoehorn something that doesn’t make sense.” Because of that, he said, Tesla is designing its forthcoming Model Y semi-truck completely independently from its past vehicles, even though critics have suggested it should be more similar to the Model 3.

Musk also made some more personal confessions at Tesla’s shareholder meeting, suggesting he sometimes unwinds by taking insomnia drug Ambien and drinking wine, among other habits."

They made it! They made a very beautiful, fast, and affordable electric car for the masses.

Since Elon Musk announced the Tesla Model 3 last year and everyone who is slightly involved was excited about these car.

If they made it to the end it would change the way we think about electric car forever.

I mean, they always do this. From the Roadster to Model X and Model S they changed a lot of concepts in our minds about cars. And countries like Norway now has so many Teslas and the government help people to adapt the new electric car concept.

So, why the Tesla model 3 is important and what concepts it is going to change?

It is so important and perhaps the most important project in Tesla because they depend on it in taking more of the market. They made it pretty clear that they are making a car for the masses.

Musk said that Tesla learned a lot of lessons from the previous models and they are going to apply what they learned in the Model 3.

If the Model 3 becomes a hit, Tesla is going to change the concept that to buy a good electric car you have to pay so much money. They already changed the concept that electric cars are boring and slow with their previous model and the model 3 is going to be incredibly fast but it is also going to be so affordable starting from $35,000.

Last Friday Elon delivered the first 30 cars for their actual owners and now they are working on the rest.

While Tesla looks to broaden to a wider base of consumers, a signal like this could be a good one for the company going forward as its existing sweet spot has been luxury car owners. Tesla reported a better-than-expected second quarter, with revenue of $2.79 billion and a loss of $1.33 per share. There’s a laundry list of technical terms in its earnings release, but the main thing to note here is that the outlook for the company may be better than expected as it starts delivering the Model 3.

“This growing demand gives us even more reason to expect increased deliveries of Model S and Model X in the second half of this year,” the company said in the release.

Wall Street expected the company to post a loss of around $1.88 per share on revenue of $2.5 billion. With that beat, shares of Tesla were up around 4 percent after the earnings release came out. Tesla said it delivered 22,026 Model S and Model X vehicles this quarter for a total of 47,077 vehicles in the first half of the year. The latter falls into the low end of the production range Tesla said it expected to hit (between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles) during its last earnings report.

Tesla began its first very early Model 3 rollout late last month, starting up the process of the company hoping to reach a broader audience beyond wealthy car enthusiasts. The Model 3, while it has a large price tag, is geared more toward the average consumer as a similar driving experience (like sitting in an iPod) with a long driving range and a smaller price point. In theory, this would help the company branch into larger competition with existing car manufacturers. Since that handover last month, the company said it is averaging more than 1,800 net Model 3 reservations per day.

Of course, that’s a while away. The company says it hopes to begin producing 100 in August, 1,500 by September, and then as many as 20,000 vehicles per month in December. It’s a slow ramp up as the company hopes to hit a run rate of producing 500,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2018. Tesla has received more than 400,000 orders to date, and it looks like it’s going to take a while for the company to fulfill all those requests.

That doesn’t seem to bother Wall Street, however. In the past 12 months, Tesla’s stock has risen more than 40 percent, and it’s up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. Wall Street still hammered the stock in recent months following a blistering report from Goldman Sachs."

On Friday, the company delivered its first batch of the highly anticipated sedans.

Reservations for the Model 3, which starts at $35,000, have grown to more than 500,000, up from the 373,000 the company reported in the spring of 2016. That is more than the total annual sales of any entry-level luxury car, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a note sent Monday.

Yet, analysts still have concerns over whether Tesla can make the cars fast enough, keep the Model 3 from eating into sales of its higher-end cars, and fend off eventual competition from experienced competitors.

At a company event on Friday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will be in ""production hell"" for the next six months or longer as it ramps up Model 3 production. Even with that, customers who order a Model 3 now will likely not receive it until the end of 2018, he added.

""CEO Elon Musk sounds increasingly squeamish about the production ramp,"" Sacconaghi said in his note."

Shares rose as high as 8 percent to $351.67 in late trade.

Despite a warning by Chief Executive Elon Musk last week that the Silicon Valley automaker would face six months of “manufacturing hell” in producing its first Model 3s, investors were enthusiastic over a remaining $3 billion cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, as loss-making Tesla spent just shy of $1 billion on capital expenditures, less than expected.

Still, given the continued build-out of the Fremont factory and Tesla’s Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada, the possibility of continued cash burn is high. Tesla said it plans $2 billion in capital expenses in the second half of the year, which would erode its cash cushion to about $1 billion.

Musk, however, told analysts on a conference call the company was considering debt to expand cash on hand, “but not thinking about a capital raise.”

Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said Tesla’s spending was at “historical highs,” amounting to over $100 million per week.

Model S demand was increasing, Tesla said, adding that Model S and X deliveries would rise in the second half of 2017.

Musk said investors should have “zero concern” that Tesla would fail to reach its production target of 10,000 vehicles each week by the end of 2018.

Bullish investors - who sent Tesla’s share price up 77 percent from January to a June high of $386.99 - are betting on Musk’s strategy to transform the low-volume automaker into a clean energy and transportation company offering electric semi-trailer trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage.

MODEL 3 ORDERS

Tesla’s results came within a week of Tesla’s long anticipated Model 3 launch, where Musk revealed that first off the production line would be a $44,000 version of the car with a 310-mile (500 km) range. That is significantly higher than the $35,000 price most customers were anticipating, before incentives. That base model will begin production in January.

Elon corrected a statement he made at the event that Tesla had booked over 500,000 net reservations for the Model 3, changing that to 455,000.

Tesla will begin delivering Model 3s to non-employees in the fourth quarter, it said.

As production improves, the non-GAAP Model 3 gross margin should be positive in the fourth quarter, Tesla said, eventually growing to 25 percent in 2018.

Revenue in the quarter rose to $2.79 billion from $1.27 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding items, the company lost $1.33 per share.

Tesla globally sold about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and about 50,000 vehicles in 2015. Factoring cars sold since 2008, Tesla will be cutting it close to 200,000 vehicles by the time deliveries begin at the end of the year.

But the credit doesn't disappear the second an automaker hits 200,000 vehicles. Instead, the credit would first fall by 50%, CNN reported.

On its website, Tesla doesn't make any guarantees about the federal tax incentive.

""We are committed to providing you with the most current information about incentives at the time of purchase. We'll do the same when it's time for confirming your Model 3 order,"" the website says.

Tesla's new Autopilot system will also cost at least $7,100, but more on that later."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released 500 pages of findings into the May 2016 death of Joshua Brown, a former Navy SEAL, near Williston, Florida. Brown's Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the ""Autopilot"" mode and he was killed.

A Tesla spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report. In 2016, the company said Autopilot ""does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility,"" however.

Brown family lawyer Jack Landskroner said in an email the NTSB's findings should put to rest previous media reports that Brown was watching a movie at the time of the crash, which he called ""unequivocally false.""

He added that the family has not taken any legal action against Tesla and was still reviewing the NTSB report.

The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.

During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in the report.

The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said ""Hands Required Not Detected.""

In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to ""Hands Required Detected"" for one to three second periods.

Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do

not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car.

The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls.

In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown's death.

NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles (119 km) per hour less than two minutes before the crash -- above the 65 mph speed limit.

The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact. Brown ""took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision,"" the report said.

A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation. He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday.

The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle's speed and other data, which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars.

For that reason, the NTSB said it ""had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software."""

The luxury cars regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory, according to the workers. Quality checks have routinely revealed defects in more than 90 percent of Model S and Model X vehicles inspected after assembly, these individuals said, citing figures from Tesla’s internal tracking system as recently as October. Some of these people told Reuters of seeing problems as far back as 2012.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said its quality control process is unusually rigorous, designed to flag and correct the tiniest imperfections. It declined to provide post-assembly defect rates to Reuters or comment on those cited by employees.

The world’s most efficient automakers, such as Toyota (7203.T), average post-manufacturing fixes on fewer than 10 percent of their cars, according to industry experts. Getting quality right during initial assembly is crucial, they said, because repairs waste time and money.

At Tesla “so much goes into rework after the car is done ... that’s where their money is being spent,” a former Tesla supervisor said.

The Silicon Valley automaker said the majority of its post-assembly defects are minor and resolved in a matter of minutes.

Tesla has enthralled consumers with sleek designs, clean technology and legendary acceleration on its pricey cars. A Consumer Reports survey found 91 percent of Tesla owners would buy again.

Still, the magazine and market researcher J.D. Power have dinged the company on quality, citing troubles such as faulty door handles and body panel gaps. Bernstein analyst A.M. (Toni) Sacconaghi, Jr. test-drove one of the company’s new Model 3 sedans earlier this month, writing that the fit and finish were “relatively poor.” Tesla owners have complained on web forums of annoying rattles, buggy software and poor seals that allow rainwater to seep into the interior or trunk.

Auto industry experts say the company’s survival now depends on its ability to crank out high-quality cars in volume as it begins to build its first mass-market car, the Model 3, which starts at $35,000.

Tesla has never turned an annual profit and is burning through $1 billion a quarter. That is unsustainable without fresh cash or a big increase in sales to mainstream customers who may prove less forgiving of potential defects.

“We’ve never doubted Tesla’s ability to make exciting products with top specifications, but there’s a difference between unveiling something and then actually making it perfectly in large volume. Tesla has not perfected the latter yet,” Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote earlier this month.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has vowed the company would become “the best manufacturer on Earth,” helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for the Model 3. However, production woes have slowed deliveries of the much-anticipated sedan.

Snags are normal with any new launch. But chronic defects with Tesla’s established Models S and X show a company still struggling to master basic manufacturing, workers said.

Known as “kickbacks” within Tesla, these vehicles have glitches as minor as dents and scratches to more complex troubles such as malfunctioning seats. Easy fixes are made swiftly on the factory floor, workers said.

Trickier cases head to one of Tesla’s outdoor parking lots to await repair. The backlog in one of those two lots, dubbed the “yard,” has exceeded 2,000 vehicles at times, workers told Reuters.

Tesla denied to Reuters that such “repair lots” exist.

Reuters interviewed nine current and former Tesla employees, including a former senior manager, with experience in assembly, quality control and repairs on Model S and Model X. All requested anonymity because the company required them to sign non-disclosure agreements. Four of the people were fired for cause, including two last month as part of a mass dismissal of hundreds of workers for what Tesla said was poor performance. Sacked workers who spoke with Reuters denied they were poor performers.

People with knowledge of Tesla’s internal quality data shared those figures with Reuters. The news agency was unable to confirm the information independently.

Defects included “doors not closing, material trim, missing parts, all kinds of stuff. Loose objects, water leaks, you name it,” another former supervisor said. “We’ve been building a Model S since 2012. How do we still have water leaks?”

Tesla shares were down 3.4 percent to $306.60 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

BUILD FAST, FIX LATER

Tesla disputed workers’ portrayal of the automaker as struggling to produce defect-free vehicles. A spokesperson described a rigorous process that requires all cars to pass more than 500 inspections and tests. Any reworking of cars after assembly reflects the company’s commitment to quality, the spokesperson said.

“Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer,” Tesla said in a statement. “Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement. Most customers would never notice the work that is done post production, but we care about even a fraction of a millimeter body gap difference or a slight paint gloss texture. We then feed these improvements back to production in a pursuit of perfection.”

Employees who worked on Model S and Model X described pressure to keep the assembly line moving, even when problems emerged. Some told of batches of cars being sent through with parts missing - windshields in one case, bumpers in another - because there were none on hand. The understanding, they said, was that these and other flaws would be fixed later.

Quality inspectors would sometimes find more defects than those reported by workers in the internal tracking system when a car came off the line. “We’d see two issues, that’s pretty good. But then we’d dig in and there would be like 15 or 20,” one person said.

One persistently tricky area was alignment, where body parts had to be “muscled,” in the words of the senior manager, to a certain degree of flushness. Not every team follows the same rule book, workers said, resulting in gaps of different size.

Tesla denied that its quality control is inconsistent and said its “extensive” process for locating and fixing errors was “very successful.”

Some workers traced the challenges to Musk’s determination to launch vehicles faster than the industry norm by shortening the design process, skipping some pre-production testing, then making improvements on the fly. Such improvisation leads to high repair rates, employees said.

For a March report called “Beyond the Hype,” J.D. Power found creaks, scratches and poor door alignment on new Model S and Model X vehicles, issues it blamed on the company’s lack of manufacturing experience. The overall quality of Tesla vehicles, it concluded, was “not competitive” within the luxury segment, lacking “precision and attention to detail.”

Such sloppiness is a rarity in luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), said Kathleen Rizk, director of global automotive consulting at J.D. Power.

“Those companies have been manufacturing forever,” she said. “They have stopgaps.”

Gadget makers like Apple (AAPL) have long directly sold their computers, phones, and tablets in shopping malls and downtowns across the country.

However, car dealers and some auto makers oppose Tesla’s sales model and have successfully lobbied a handful of states to block car makers from directly selling cars to customers. In those states, like Texas, Tesla builds showrooms where customers can learn about the cars but can’t buy them in the store.

But why does Tesla (TSLA) go to such lengths to buck the traditional independent dealer system? In recent years, the company has spent heavily building new stores around the world.

On Tuesday, Tesla’s general council, Todd Maron, gave a detailed explanation before the Federal Trade Commission about why Tesla needs to sell its cars itself. The FTC’s opinion is that states shouldn’t block direct car sales.

Maron gave these seven reasons why Tesla wants to sell cars in an entirely new way:

A Tesla Model S sedan Photograph by Mark Von Holden — WireImage via Getty Images

1). Go to the customer: Traditional independent dealerships are usually built on large plots of land in out-of-the-way locations, noted Maron. In contrast, Tesla stores are better off in areas that have a lot of foot traffic, he said. Some are in places like malls and city centers. The stores also benefit from being much smaller and more intimate.

That’s because potential Tesla customers need to learn about both Tesla and electric cars, explained Maron. Electric cars are new technology, and Tesla stores need to be both education centers and conveniently located, he said. When Apple built its stores, Steve Jobs used similar reasoning about wanting to educate customers about his company’s unusual gadgets.

2). No inventory: Traditional car dealers focus on inventory. Once they get a car onto a lot, they move it out as quickly as possible. But Tesla cars are made and sold in a completely different way. Oftentimes, customers customize their cars like picking paint colors and choosing accessories. And because Tesla shipped about 50,000 last year, customers usually have to wait months to get their cars.

3). Education process: Unlike customers at traditional dealers who come in to get the lowest price, potential Tesla customers go into Tesla stores to learn about the technology. Tesla reps often spend hours with customers to teach them where they can charge Tesla cars, the size of government electric car incentives, and how much they can expect to pay in electricity versus gas. Car sales staff at traditional independent dealers would likely be unwilling to spend the time to educate the customer about Tesla cars, said Maron.

WATCH: Tesla puts limits on autopilot feature:

4). Different business model: Tesla makes a profit from selling its electric cars. But traditional dealers make more money from selling services, tuneups and add-ons than they do from selling cars, said Maron. Electric cars have fewer service requirements like oil changes than gas-powered cars do.

5). Advertising: Traditional auto dealers rely on auto makers to fund their advertising, said Maron. But he said that Tesla doesn’t do traditional advertising and wouldn’t let another company do it for them. That’s just another reason why the traditional dealer model isn’t compatible with Tesla, noted Maron.

6). Dealers won’t make money: Perhaps the most compelling reason, said Maron, is that traditional franchise dealers won’t be able to make money from selling Tesla’s cars. Dealers mark up cars they sell to make a profit. But a customer could just go online, or to a neighboring state, and buy a Tesla car without the additional markup.

7). Gas conflict of interest: Tesla is striving to replace gas-powered cars with its electric cars, and promotes its models as superior to those with internal combustion engines. However, the vast majority of cars sold through dealers are gas-powered cars. Tesla’s Maron said that dealers, therefore, wouldn’t be the good advocates for electric cars that Tesla needs."
https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tesla-electric-truck/,pos,0.9999999994338885,5.661242345532158e-10,"Unlike Hyperloop, Elon Musk's Electric Big-Rig Actually Makes Sense",2017-04-13 22:11:01,2019-06-24 14:20:08.770213,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"Once again, Elon Musk has prompted a flurry of speculation with a single tweet. But unlike hyperloop or his ridiculous tunneling idea, this one totally makes sense: an electric big rig.

The busiest man in tech already faces looming deadlines for getting a battery factory up to speed, the Model 3 out the door, and a secret payload (probably a spy satellite) into orbit. So you might think he'd resist adding to his to-do list. Nope. Turns out he's got a team working on a battery-powered truck he will reveal in September, as part of his master plan to shift the world to sustainable energy.

I hear you chuckling. But this idea is not crazy as you might think. Plans for such a truck, if they truly exist, almost certainly call for batteries alone, because Musk disdains hybrids and range-extended electrics like the Chevrolet Volt. That makes his idea easier to design and build than a conventional car, SUV, or pickup (which Musk also wants to make). It helps that he's not the first guy to think of this. Nikola Motor Company is pursuing a similar goal.

Semis and the trailers they haul are big enough to hold the ginormous battery pack needed to do the job. The frame of a semi is essentially a pair of long steel rails, which could easily support a battery pack (which also could go behind the cab). Ditching the internal combustion engine saves more space, and lets you use smaller motors on each axle or even each wheel. Electric motors provide oceans of torque, improving acceleration and pulling power, and slinging the battery and motors between the frame rails lowers the center of gravity, improving handling. Tidier packaging increases aerodynamic efficiency, which squeezes more range from the battery.

The biggest drawback? Range. Long-haul truckers typically cover 400 to 600 miles a day, something hard to do with batteries alone—unless you're packing a mighty big one. “I imagine they’ll use a 600-kWh battery, possibly up to 800-kWh,” says Nikola CEO Trevor Milton. (The Model S sedan sports a pack that tops out at 100 kilowatt-hours.) With a little math, Milton figures “Musk’s truck will get around 200 to 300 miles range.” Not much, which explains why Nikola uses a hydrogen fuel cell generator to boost range to 1,000 miles.

Still, 300 miles works for short, repetitive routes. Two hundred miles gets you from the Port of Los Angeles to the vast distribution warehouses in Riverside and back with range to spare. Ditto Oakland, Seattle, and so forth. You can see these things working in urban areas, where diesel trucks create a lot of air pollution and noise. That explains why officials with the Port of LA like the idea of electric trucks powered by overhead lines like trolley buses.

Electric trucks schlepping stuff short distances makes sense because they typically return to a depot, which makes charging a snap. But here, too, Musk's idea makes a certain kind of sense. Long-haul trucks tend to use interstates, where Tesla already has a network of Supercharger stations. The chargers can get a Model S sedan to 80 percent charge in as little as 30 minutes. A truck would need longer, of course, but don't forget that federal rules dictate how long truckers can drive without a break. If they've gotta take a break anyway, why not charge up?

Granted, EV drivers visiting the most popular Supercharger stations often find themselves waiting in a queue. Selling the Model 3 in any significant numbers will exacerbate that problem, so you can imagine what might happen if Tesla starts building big rigs. “They’re also going to run into problems with the grid—just try charging 100 trucks at one location,” says Milton. Dedicated truck charging stations at the most common origins and destinations makes more sense, and could be sold as a package to a fleet management company. Who knows—Tesla could even team up with a chain of truck stops to provide charging.

No one's saying working out the details would be easy. But then again, this isn't rocket science. And it can't be any harder than tunneling under LA or firing people through tubes."

Musk one-upped that a few months later, vowing to demonstrate a completely autonomous, cross-country trip in a Tesla by the end of 2017.

But since then, the company has fallen behind in updating its flagship semi-autonomous driving system, Autopilot, irking some among its legions of obsessed fans, and raising questions about Tesla’s ability to deliver on the promise of a fully self-driving car. In an August earnings call, Musk admitted the cross-country trip may be delayed. “It is certainly possible that I will have egg on my face on that front,” he said.

It’s been nearly five months since the last Autopilot update

Since Musk’s announcement, Autopilot 2.0’s over-the-air software updates have been infrequent and scattered, Tesla owners say. For the first half of 2017, there were updates generally every three weeks, such as the ability to use Autosteer at speeds up to 90 mph on the highway and 35 mph on local roads. It’s been nearly five months since the last significant Autopilot update, and many of the features from the previous version of the advanced driver assist system (ADAS) are still missing.

Perks such as rain-sensing wipers have yet to be added, but more operational tasks, such as the ability to read speed limit signs and differentiate between vehicle types on the road, are also absent. Other features, like automated lane changes on the highway, better steering on tight roads, and auto-summon, were promised by the end of 2016, but have yet to be rolled out. Tesla has since removed the date from its website.

In his announcement a year ago, Musk showed video of a Tesla leaving a garage, driving across town, and finding its own parking spot — all autonomously. While there was someone behind the wheel during the demonstration, the implication was clear: this was a car that will drive itself, and sooner than you think possible.

But “Enhanced Autopilot,” as it was called, wasn’t complete. As a result, Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 have many fewer safety and convenience features enabled than in older models. Musk acknowledged as much during his announcement, noting that “it will probably sometime next year” when Tesla cars with the newer hardware suite caught up to the previous versions in functionality. In early 2017, Musk tweeted that most of those features would be rolling out soon, but months later, many are still missing.

Given the lag in Autopilot updates, some Tesla owners now question whether the company can deliver on what’s ultimately been promised: full self-driving. “It just leaves you with no faith that they are anywhere on that path,” said Ian Jordan, an electrical engineer from Seattle who owns a Model S. “Today they can’t reliably detect a speed limit sign, so it just seems like an enormous gap.”

“It just leaves you with no faith that they are anywhere on that path.”

Jordan, who is also an investor in Tesla, said his Model S would routinely “freak out and dive for oncoming traffic” when Autopilot becomes confused by certain intersections in his neighborhood. “Don’t know what it is,” he said. “Every time.” Unlike most other major driver assistance systems, Tesla owners can decide to turn on Autopilot regardless of where they are driving; other ADAS, like Cadillac’s Super Cruise, restrict use to divided highways. In order to gather the maximum amount of data, it would behoove Tesla to encourage customers to use Autopilot as much as possible in safe conditions.

That’s probably because the company’s ambitions to offer full self-driving depends on its drivers using Autopilot all the time. Before Teslas can start driving autonomously, the company needs to collect a lot of data to prove to customers (and regulators) that the technology is safe and reliable. So, its cars run Autopilot in “shadow mode” in order for Tesla to gather statistical data to show false positives and false negatives of the software. In shadow mode, the car isn’t taking any action, but it registers when it would have taken action.

It also casts a spotlight on the major difference between Tesla and practically every other automaker and tech company pursuing autonomous driving: Tesla is breaking with its competitors in the self-driving space by declining to include LIDAR sensors under the assumption the equipment will be too expensive for personal ownership. Musk has said previously that LIDAR sensors “don’t make sense in a car context.” Instead, the cars rely on eight cameras for 360-degree vision, as well as 12 ultrasonic sensors and forward-facing radar.

Most companies assume self-driving cars will be shared and used in restricted, geofenced areas, like downtowns or college campuses. Tesla is banking on autonomous cars being cheap enough (and reliable enough) for people to own. But to get there, it needs to convince people that Autopilot is a better, safer way to drive. As a highly advanced version of adaptive cruise control, it has a lot going for it. But there are internal and external forces that suggest things aren’t going as planned.

As a highly advanced version of adaptive cruise control, it has a lot going for it.

Internally, Tesla has experienced a lot of upheaval as it relates to Autopilot. The company’s team of engineers working on Autopilot reacted with dismay to Musk’s announcement last year, believing Autopilot lacked the capability to deliver full self-driving, according to the Wall Street Journal. In addition, CNN reported that Musk reportedly brushed aside certain concerns as negligible compared to Autopilot's overall lifesaving potential, but employees who worked on Autopilot struggled to make the same leap.

A major cause of this conflict has apparently been the way Musk chose to market Autopilot. The decision to refer to Autopilot as a “full self-driving” solution — language that makes multiple appearances on the company’s website, especially during the process of ordering a car — was the spark for multiple departures, including Sterling Anderson, who was in charge of the Autopilot team during last year’s announcement, the Journal reported. In June, Chris Lattner left his post running software for Tesla’s Autopilot division after just six months.

Externally, federal regulators were still sifting through the wreckage (both literal and digital) from the 2016 crash that killed a man driving a Tesla Model S while using Autopilot. The National Traffic Safety Board recently concluded that Autopilot contributed to the crash and recommended that all automakers, Tesla included, consider more serious limitations to where its semi-autonomous systems can be used and how they market such products.

There are other factors likely contributing to Tesla’s infrequent Autopilot updates. The company is in the midst of what Musk has called “production hell” with the Model 3. Customers and investors are watching intently to see if Tesla can deliver on its promise of a mass-market, battery-electric car. And the effects of Tesla’s decision to part ways with the supplier Mobileye in 2016 are still being processed. With the introduction of the second-generation Autopilot in October 2016, Tesla eliminated Mobileye’s computer vision technology powered by its EyeQ3 chip. The company replaced that with its own computer vision system called “Tesla Vision” powered by Nvidia’s Drive PX2 onboard computer.

Autopilot 2.0 is “still missing a lot of the functionality of the original version that relied more heavily on Mobileye from their vision system,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst at Navigant. “And from everything that we’ve seen, it does not sound like they have caught up to where Mobileye was a year and a half ago.”

“it does not sound like they have caught up to where Mobileye was a year and a half ago.”

Tesla creates the impression that these are changes that can be fixed with over-the-air software updates, an area where the company has proven to be more nimble and willing to take risks than legacy OEMs — and a feature that customers rate highly. But autonomous driving, especially Level 4 and 5 that Musk has promised, requires a very specific hardware suite in order to be safe and reliable. Recently, it was reported that Tesla quietly developed a new hardware suite with more computing power to help achieve its goal of full automation, which would seem to contradict Musk’s October 2016 vow that all vehicles would be shipped with “full self-driving capabilities.”

Tesla argues that customer safety undergirds all its decisions, and that it prioritizes features that would have the most immediate impact on that. Nonetheless, a spokesperson acknowledged that its Autopilot updates have been few and far between, and that the company was working to correct that.

""For our customers who opted to purchase our Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving packages, we’re working super hard on new features and rapid progress is definitely being made,” a spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. “As is the case with any new technology, validation of first-of-its-kind technology is subject to a high number of variables which can impact product readiness timelines significantly. While it's taken longer than we originally expected to roll out all Enhanced Autopilot features, the product already provides significant assistance to drivers, and this year our platform was re-engineered to facilitate improved data collection, mapping, and fleet learning – important foundational changes which we expect to enable more dramatic improvements for our customers over time. With safety at the core of everything we do and every decision we make, we will be rolling out advanced new features as soon as they’re validated, and we’re grateful for everyone’s patience.”

“We’re working super hard on new features.”

But as Tesla expands to the mass market, that attitude may not be enough. “The customers they’ve had up till this point are clearly within the early adopter group,” Abuelsamid said. “They are willing to cut Tesla much more slack than I think a typical customer would be, in terms of both functionality and quality... Tesla really needs to get all that sorted out if they’re going to become a mainstream brand.”

Any blowback from customers and critics so far has been mild. The company continues to grow sales of its Model S and Model X amid a soft luxury car market, and Tesla’s stock continues to climb. And despite serious questions about the company’s ability to deliver the promised number of Model 3s, Tesla’s brand remains relatively untarnished. Fans of the taboo-shattering company seem to have internalized the fact that Musk’s mouth can sometimes outpace his company’s ability to deliver. If anything, it makes them love him more — even if it makes him seem like a buffoonish character from HBO’s Silicon Valley.

“I want to believe he's Henry Ford,” one commenter on Reddit wrote in a recent post about the lack of Autopilot updates, “but it's really hard to shake the feeling he's Gavin Belson.”

Updated October 24th, 3:11PM ET: Tesla released an improvement to Autosteer last Monday. This story has been changed to reflect that there hasn’t been a significant Autopilot update in nearly five months."

Blink and you'll miss it: The Tesla Model S was just rated the third-fastest accelerating production car in the world, beating out cars such as the Lamborghini Aventador and the Bugatti Veyron.

The head-snapping acceleration of the new supercharged Model S raises a question: Just how did engineers at Tesla get the electric, seven-seat family sedan to go so fast?

It turns out, one part of the car largely determines the Tesla's impressive performance.

""They're adding a bigger battery, and adding a bigger battery makes it more powerful,"" said Mike Duoba, a mechanical engineer at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, who develops standards for hybrid plug-in vehicles. [Hyperloop, Jetpack & More: 9 Futuristic Transit Ideas]

The Tesla Model S, used in what the company calls ""Ludicrous mode,"" can go from 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) in 2.5 seconds, the company said in a statement. The only commercial cars on the planet that can beat the Tesla Model S, the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder, each cost about $1 million and are ""tiny"" two-seater roadsters. Neither was built for the masses and neither is currently being produced. (The fastest custom-built race car, the Grimsel, can reach the same speed as the Tesla in about 1.5 seconds.)

Tesla confirms that the secret sauce behind this record-breaking time is the new battery. (Those who want to upgrade their existing Model S can purchase a bigger battery for $10,000.)

In general, a battery's energy density predicts how much energy it can release (meaning how far the car drives) before recharging, while the power density (the energy density delivered per second) determines how fast energy can go in and out of the battery. That, in turn, governs how fast a car can accelerate, said Jordi Cabana, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who studies battery chemistry.

The new Tesla battery helps quickly achieve these lightning-fast speeds by increasing the latter, Cabana said.

Though exact details haven't been released, the Model S likely uses a lithium-ion battery where one layer, called the cathode, is made of a blend of nickel, manganese and cobalt oxide (NMC), Cabana said. When charged, lithium ions from the cathode are driven through an electrolyte solution into the anode, which is made of stacks of graphite. Lithium-ion batteries that overheat can sometimes produce a runaway chain reaction and catch fire; to prevent that, manufacturers encase individual cells containing both a cathode and anode in protective shells. The Tesla Model S battery likely has thousands of these cells, Cabana said. (Tesla's home battery uses similar technology.)

The new battery may have crammed more cells into the same space of the older Tesla S battery pack, Cabana said.

""It looks like they changed the internal design of the battery pack,"" Cabana told Live Science. ""They reduced the amount of packaging that they put in the battery to make it safe.""

Historically, batteries that could produce enough power for fast acceleration or enough energy for long-range driving were typically quite expensive. That's in part why battery-powered electric cars had a reputation for being less peppy than an equivalent gasoline car, Duoba said. However, a 2014 study in the journal Nature found that the cost of electric batteries has been plummeting, paving the way for cheaper, speedier, longer-range vehicles.

Take the battery out of the equation, and electric cars have an edge in speed tests.

For one, engines have myriad tiny parts that must spin, push, open and close to produce internal combustion at the right times, Duoba said.

""An engine is a sort of a breathing animal: It has to take air in and squeeze it,"" Duoba told Live Science. ""Those processes are not instantaneous."" (In a gas-powered engine, a piston compresses a mixture of air and fuel, causing combustion, which turns the motor.)

Electric motors, meanwhile, don't have all those tiny moving parts.

""The electronics in an electric motor are almost instantaneous,"" Duoba said. ""There's no delay in power, no waiting for throttles to close. All those little effects add up.""

Electric motors can achieve their maximum torque, or the rotational force that is transmitted from the motor to turn the wheels, anywhere from 0 to 4,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), which roughly corresponds to vehicle speeds between 0 and 30 mph (48 km/h), said Paul Chambon, a controls engineer who is an expert on powertrains at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.

In contrast, gasoline-powered cars cannot achieve peak torque at either a very low or very high rpm. Engines are optimized to run best with certain combinations of air flow, temperature and rotational speed. That means the torque in gas-powered engines peaks around 4,500 rpm, and that a graph of torque versus rpm looks like a domed hat, Chambon said.

So at zero speed, gas-powered engines are not at their peak.

""They don't have that peak torque right away, you have to accelerate to middle speed to gain enough torque,"" Chambon said.

The dome-shaped torque graph also has another implication: At low speeds, the torque needed to propel the car doesn't match the torque produced by the engine.

As a result, manufacturers place a gearbox between the engine and the wheels, which matches engine speed to that needed to rotate the wheels at a certain torque, Chambon said. Gear shifting creates lulls in the car's acceleration.

But because electric vehicles can operate at peak torque anywhere from 0 to 4,000 rpm and can spin faster than engines, they often have no gearbox.

""There's no gear shifting, that alone is probably worth half a second or maybe a third of a second,"" in the 0-to-60 test, Duoba said.

Editor's Note: This article was updated to correct the make and model for the Lamborghini Aventador and Bugatti Veyron, which were swapped in the original article. The article was also corrected to update how the range of rpms in electric motors corresponds to maximum torque, as well as road speed.

But Is the Eco Hype Overblown?,2017-05-02 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:12.673342,,"One of the best ways to flaunt your Earth-hugging bona fides these days is to buy an electric car. It shows you’re willing to put your money—a lot of your money—where your mouth is, assuming your mouth spends a fair amount of time declaiming on global warming, atmospheric carbon emissions, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, and the sinister intentions of the global hydrocarbon extraction cabal. Buying a Tesla demonstrates you’re doing your part to keep our planet cool and green.

That’s what a lot of well-intentioned people think, anyway. But Richard Muller, a UC Berkeley physics professor emeritus and the co-founder of Berkeley Earth, a global warming research group, has a foursquare contrarian view. If you’ve purchased a Tesla, says Muller, you’ve been duped by the most polished and accomplished corporate salesman since Steven Jobs: the company’s CEO and founder, Elon Musk.

“The difference is that Jobs had a fantastic product line,” says Muller. “Musk is mostly selling hype. Teslas aren’t really doing anything beneficial for the planet. It’s more about conspicuous consumption. If you buy one, you’re either a rich guy who’s trying to look socially responsible, or you’re somebody who’s trying to come across as a rich guy.”

Muller’s views are at least partly shared by Ozzie Zehner, a former visiting scholar at Berkeley and the author of Green Illusions: the Dirty Secrets of Clean Energy and the Future of Environmentalism. They’re among a body of scientists and policy analysts who decry what they perceive as misplaced priorities in climate change response, particularly electric cars.

“That halo above electric cars is drooping a bit,” says Zehner, who has an engineering B.A. and a M.S. in Science and Technology Studies. “It’s becoming apparent that we were seduced by a sort of self-serving instrumental ignorance when it came to critically thinking about electric vehicles. The principal value of electric vehicles and hybrids is that they allow upper-middle class and wealthy drivers to absolve themselves from their environmental sins. It also might get them tax breaks, free parking, allowance to drive and HOV lanes, and some street cred among their friends.”

Notwithstanding the growing skepticism of these researchers, the electric car biz is going gangbusters: Tesla can’t keep up with orders and respected reviewers like Car and Driver consistently give their pricey vehicles five-star reviews. In mid-April, Tesla’s market valuation passed that of General Motors, to the dismay of skeptics like AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson, who called it “inexplicable,” since GM currently sells 130 times as many cars as the trendy Silicon Valley start-up.

And who knows, maybe the way toward a greener future starts with a hipper-than-thou status symbol.

To be sure, the marketplace is a reflection of desire as well as necessity, and valuation is often driven by the promise of growth rather than past success. And who knows, maybe the way toward a greener future starts with a hipper-than-thou status symbol. Rock star entrepreneur Musk, after all, isn’t just selling cars. He also has spun off home and commercial battery systems from his electric vehicle (EV) technology that, he says, will make the national energy grid more reliable and far less CO2-intensive.

Perhaps the sheen of Tesla’s expensive, stylish S (starting at $68,000) and X ($80,000) models, provided the sizzle to help drive sales for the entire EV sector, which rose 37 percent in 2016. Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford all sold over 10,000 all-electric cars in the United States last year, and all were priced at under $35,000. And Tesla will reportedly break out of its elite niche next year with the launch of the Model 3, its first car targeted at the middle-class consumer, which quickly garnered several-thousand pre-order deposits.

According to Muller, electric cars could reduce carbon emissions one day, but he stresses that they’re only as green as the grid from which they draw their juice. “So in California and some other parts of the West, they can make some nominal sense because we use a lot of natural gas, wind and solar,” Muller says. “But in the eastern U.S., where at least half of electrical energy comes from coal? No. The carbon burden is simply pushed from the car to the power plant. With coal-generated power, you could actually exacerbate carbon emissions by driving an electric car, particularly if you chose it over a hybrid or a fuel-efficient standard car.”

Moreover, electric vehicles remain bedeviled by an inherent technological challenge that may prove insurmountable: batteries. He believes the cost and fragility of batteries big and light enough to provide significant range will keep EVs too expensive to appeal to the world’s car-buying masses.

“Lithium batteries are a huge issue,” says Muller. “They’re not only initially expensive, but they’re vulnerable to damage from all the shaking and bouncing cars go through, and they have to be replaced every 100,000 miles… . Batteries are wonderful for storing energy for, say, wind, or solar projects. But they’re not so great as the primary power source for vehicles.”

Zehner, meanwhile, maintains electric vehicles have numerous hidden environmental costs that ultimately outweigh any potential environmental benefit.

“Using carbon emissions as a metric makes it easier for electrical vehicle proponents to create the illusion that their cars are somehow greener,” says Zehner, “But Carbon emissions are only one of many side effects we might use to measure human impact on the natural world. Energy extraction creates impacts that extend far beyond carbon dioxide emissions, including habitat devastation, radiation fallout risks [from nuclear power plants], and methane emissions. According to the National Academies of Science, the bulk of a vehicle’s impact comes from its construction, before you even drive it off the dealership lot. Electric vehicles require high-impact materials such as aluminum and cobalt, which is the reason these cars are so expensive. Just like other industrial goods, their high price tag ultimately reveals something about the fossil fuels used to create them.”

In fact, Zehner notes, the largest component of a lithium-ion battery is a specialized coal: graphite. “The mining industry [is] adding numerous coal mines just to supply Tesla’s Gigafactory with the coal hidden inside its batteries,” he contends.

For motorists who want to save both money and the biosphere, gas-electric hybrids are a much better choice than EVs, says Muller. Hybrid technology is largely perfected, resulting in cars that are extremely fuel-efficient, reasonably priced and have a better range.

It should be noted that at one point in Muller’s career he also expressed skepticism about global warming science, but he recanted his position in a widely circulated 2012 New York Times oped. He remains controversial in climate change circles because Berkeley Earth received money from Charles Koch to fund some of the research that ultimately led to Muller’s acceptance of anthropogenic climate change.

Having accepted that humans are causing the problem, however, he remains deeply irked by “solutions” he considers overblown, like electric cars.

“In the coming decades, most of projected warming is going to be due to carbon emissions from China, India, and less developed countries,” Muller says. “If the U.S. disappeared today, the rate of global warming would return to its current state within four years. So the best thing we can do in the United States isn’t buying Teslas—it’s setting examples for the major carbon emitters of tomorrow.” And, he adds, since China’s current main energy source is coal, EV cars could actually increase China’s apocalyptic air pollution and voluminous CO2 emissions. (He supports China’s move to next-gen nuclear power plants.)

“But over a couple of years, [EVs will] dig themselves out of that carbon deficit, particularly in regions with grids that rely on [renewable resources].”

Zehner’s dissent runs even deeper. He is particularly exasperated by EVs because he thinks their promotion ignores—unwittingly or purposely—the main drivers of biosphere degradation: human population and consumption.

“Electric vehicles do nothing to address either of these principal factors,” he says. “Instead, their construction and use depend on some of the most destructive and fossil-fuel intensive extraction techniques that we have ever created.”

Both Muller and Zehner believe the EV industry is currently in something of a bubble that will collapse under the weight of excessive expectations.

“The EV sector will peak and collapse long before there is an all-electric fleet or charging infrastructure to support it,” Zehner says. “That’s because the EV dream is based on energy laundering and subsidies from taxpayers, pensioners whose retirement accounts are vested in the associated companies, poor cobalt miners in the Congo, and the natural world. Eventually the scheme will become financially and materially untenable.”

Zehner adds that he “would not mind being wrong. It would be great news if these sports cars really do have the environmental benefits that many environmental groups praise.

But EVs still have plenty of supporters in the research and policy spheres, and Tim Lipman, the co-director of Cal’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, is among them. Lipman agrees with Zehner that EVs impose more energy and carbon emission costs in their production than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars or hybrids, “But over a couple of years, they dig themselves out of that carbon deficit, particularly in regions with grids that rely on [renewable resources].”

Further, coal is in decline as a power source while alternative sources are ascendant. And while hybrids and smaller ICE cars may result in fewer net carbon emissions than EVs in those areas heavily reliant on coal, it’s usually a matter of degree rather than overwhelming superiority, says Lipman. It’s incumbent on environmentally concerned consumers to consider three separate factors when comparing EVs to other vehicles.

“You have to think about carbon emissions, certainly, but you also need to think about criteria pollutants: zone, nitrogen oxide, particulates. That stuff comes out at street level if you’re driving a gasoline-powered car or even a hybrid. By contrast, even [U.S.] coal-fired plants are pretty well regulated for criteria pollutants these days, and the pollutants they do produce are centralized at or near the plant and dispersed from tall smokestacks, so you don’t receive them right in your face in concentrated form.”

Energy security also must be taken into account, says Lipman. Even with domestic fracking, the U.S. still imported almost eight million barrels of oil a day in 2016, and most of that was refined for the use of vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“EVs effectively address all three of these concerns,” says Lipman.

To evaluate the relative emissions of EVs, hybrids and internal combustion vehicles on a state-by-state basis, go to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center website."
https://www.wired.com/2017/03/tesla-model-3-musk-production/,pos,1.0,4.1611575627214897e-16,"As Tesla's Model 3 Nears Production, Here's What We Know",2017-03-25 11:30:59,2019-06-24 14:20:14.953922,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"When does a six second video send the car and tech communities into a frenzy? When it's posted by Elon Musk, and it shows his long-gestating new baby, the Tesla Model 3, peeling away from a standstill under heavy acceleration before braking to a hard stop 100 feet up the street.

Same goes for a pair of images Musk shared Sunday morning, showing what he says is the first production Model 3—no more prototypes, the real thing—in all its shiny glory. Just in time, too. Tesla will hold ""handover party"" on July 28, delivering the first 30 cars to their lucky owners. Musk has said production will ramp up quickly, to 20,000 cars per month in December. He has previously pledged to build half a million cars a year by 2018.1

What makes these photos and that short, grainy clip so interesting? The same reasons that pushed rabid fans to mock up an online configurator, the automotive equivalent of fan fic. For one, Tesla has revealed close to zilch about the car since showing it off as a prototype a year ago, even though production should start this summer. And two, this is the most anticipated—and most important—vehicle the upstart automaker will ever build.

Starting at $35,000 ($27,500 if you can land the federal tax credit) and offering 215 miles of range, the Model 3 is Tesla's bid for the mass market, the car that could move it out of the luxury segment and realize Musk's dream of changing how humanity moves.

So, now that production has started, here's a look at what we know about the current state of the Model 3—and when you can get your zap-happy paws on one.

First, a closer look at that video tweet. Musk captioned the new video, ""First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3,"" indicating the on-screen star is pretty much ready for sale, but might need some bugs ironed out. So, good news: The Model 3 looks just like the sleek, handsome prototype Musk revealed on stage last year (at least from the outside).

That’s unusual; in the real world, regulations and production restrictions tend to kill off design flourishes. Compare the similarly affordable, long-range Bolt EV to the concept Chevy showed in 2015: Gone are the heavily raked windshield, grille-free front bumper, and wrap around rear window. The car looks more 'normal'.

Now, in the non-Tesla world, car development is a slow process. Engineers typically work through alpha and beta prototype phases, where technicians assemble vehicles by hand. They wait to fine-tune the heavy machinery that stamps out body parts in case they need to modify the design. By calling this a ""release candidate,"" Musk implies the car was assembled on finalized equipment, meaning Tesla might be skipping some steps, and speeding through the process. No surprise, given Musk's focus on production line improvements, and disdain for the ""traditional way"" of doing things.

“My reading is that Tesla felt confident in the shape and design of their parts, so they can go ahead and invest in the heavy duty machinery,” says Arthur Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University. That could signal smooth sailing, or it could be resignation on Tesla’s part—a recognition that it can’t afford a delay, so it’s just going to press ahead with the design it has and hope for the best.

So, when can you get one? Musk has pledged Tesla will begin production of the Model 3 mid-year, and deliver cars to customers before the end of 2017. That’s an aggressive target, especially for a car company with a long history of missing deadlines by months or even years.

Tesla has struggled with for quality control issues of late. Future-hungry early adopters might put up with wobbly seats and poor panel gaps, but down market buyers, whom Tesla must now woo away from BMW, Chevrolet, and the like, won’t forgive flaws so easily. Wealthy Model S and X owners probably have another car in their garage to fall back on, Model 3 owners likely won't, which will only exacerbate their frustrations if their new ride spends half its life at the service center.

Musk knows all this, and has a strategy: simplify everything to make production easy. The Model 3 might look like a shrunken Model S, but Tesla is stressing that under the skin it's a different kind of machine, and it has got this car building thing sorted out now. That's why the new car has just one screen, instead of the two in the S and X (each with their own computer). The S has nearly two miles of electrical cabling, the 3 has half that. Tesla nixed the automatic pop-out door handles and jettisoned the falcon wing doors that led the Model X into what Musk calls ""production hell.""

“It's a simpler design, and we also understand manufacturing a lot better than we did in the past,” Musk said during a recent call with investors. He says the first cars will be rear wheel drive only, to keep things simple in the factory. If you want all wheel drive, or high performance versions, you'll have to wait an extra six months to a year. Not to say the Model 3 won't have any fun. It will carry the hardware for Autopilot and self-driving, as well as supercharging, but Tesla is yet to reveal how much those features will add to the base price.

Say the first vehicles off the line have some problems. That's cool, because they're all going to Tesla employees, for an unofficial, continued search for bugs, particularly any that can be fixed with an over-the-air software update. For all other Model 3 fans, a combination of patience, speculation, and obsessive watching of Elon Musk’s Twitter feed will have to be enough for now.

CLOSE Elon Musk has stated that he is ""fairly confident"" that Model 3 deliveries will start by the end of 2017. Tesla stock was on the rise during late morning trading Friday. Newslook

SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla had hoped to lure buyers into its showrooms for S-E-X.

The electric automaker's new entry-level sedan, called the Model 3, was supposed to join its upscale cousins the Model S and Model X as the Model E, CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday.

But it's clear Musk still thinks the locker-room joke will land.

""Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X,"" tweeted Musk. ""Totally different :)""

What's more, Tesla has made noise about also producing a Model Y crossover vehicle — the Y in a thwarted S-E-X-Y line-up. Denied his E, it's clear now why Musk went with the number three, essentially a backwards E, in a line-up that otherwise sticks to letters.

To Ford Motor, Model E likely sounded too much like Henry Ford's iconic Model T. While Ford's T was not the first automobile — those honors go to German pioneers — his revolutionary assembly line was the first to make the automobile available to a broad audience.

In a statement emailed to USA TODAY late Friday, Ford Motor officials said in 2010 Tesla had signed a contract in which, ""among other things, Tesla agreed not to register or use Model E. When Tesla later sought to register the Model E trademark, Ford insisted that Tesla abide by the parties' earlier agreement. The matter has been resolved.""

Tesla is pinning a lot of hopes on the Model 3, which has its coming out party in Los Angeles on March 31. The $30,000-and-up sedan represents Musk's best effort at trying to make electric cars a mass-market proposition.

Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :) — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017

Musk also tweeted out a brief video clip of what appeared to be a consumer-ready Model 3 driving down a street.

Last summer, reporters visiting Musk's mushrooming Gigafactory battery plant outside of Reno, Nev., were greeted by a Model 3 parked in front of the massive edifice, but it had no interior. The car looks very much like a pared down version of its sleek Model S sedan.

Musk used his favorite social media platform to dispel consumer impressions that the Model 3 would take the company's vehicles to the next level.

""Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the 'next version' of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true,"" he wrote. ""Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.""

EVs have yet to catch on nationally despite models rolling out from traditional automakers such as Nissan (Leaf) and General Motors (Bolt). Consumers remain concerned about range issues of electric cars, and are benefiting from a long spell of stable gas prices.

Musk has said that he hopes the Model 3 helps turbocharge the automaker's production numbers, from around 80,000 today to around 500,000 units a year.

The all-electric automaker and energy company didn’t make a big announcement signaling to its rivals that it had arrived. The small 700-square-foot showroom quietly opened Thursday within a Nordstrom department store in Somerset Collection, an upscale shopping mall in Troy, Mich. — a suburb of Detroit. This is the third showroom—or gallery as Tesla calls them—to open in a Nordstrom. Tesla opened its first showroom (of this kind) in June at Nordstrom The Grove in Los Angeles.

Tesla is not breaking the law. The company might not be allowed to sell cars in the state, but it has the right to display their cars in a showroom just like any other retailer might. But instead of throwing up a billboard or advertising their vehicles on TV, the showroom gives the automaker a chance to introduce consumers to its Model S and Model X vehicles. More importantly, it gives Tesla the opportunity to educate consumers about the electric vehicle technology behind the Model S and Model X—not to mention the semi-autonomous driving system Autopilot and other tech-forward features found in the vehicles.

Still, opening up a showroom in a mall during the busiest shopping season could be viewed as poking the bear that is the powerful automobile dealership lobby and the major automakers that are based here.

Michigan hasn’t exactly thrown out the welcome mat to Tesla, even though the company employs dozens of workers in the state. In 2015, Tesla acquired Riviera Tool, a Grand Rapids business that supplied dies to Tesla’s assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. The factory was renamed Tesla Tool & Die and retained the 100 employees that were part of Riviera Tool. In all, Tesla employs 13,000 U.S. workers.

Tesla also works with numerous suppliers in the state.

Despite Tesla’s economic contribution, the company still can’t sell cars in Michigan.

Tesla has a different business model than other automakers. It sells its own cars directly online and through its own branded stores, not through franchised dealerships. All U.S. states have laws that prevent automakers with existing franchisees from opening their own dealerships to compete with them. However, dealer associations in a number of U.S. states, including Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, and Washington, have tried to expand the law to include manufacturers like Tesla that don’t have franchise dealers.

Some states—notably Michigan and Texas—have taken an extra step and passed laws that ban direct sales. In these states, Tesla can still have a showroom, where consumers can look, but not buy, its Model S, Model X, and eventually, Model 3 vehicles. Tesla staff cannot discuss the cost of the car or take people on test drives in Michigan, although they can in Texas and other states where they only have “galleries.” They must instead direct customers to the website or a store in a neighboring state for more information.

In October 2014, Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill initiated and backed by the Michigan Automobile Dealers Association that effectively banned Tesla from selling directly to consumers in the state. Michigan-based automaker General Motors has also backed efforts to prevent Tesla from doing business there.

Tesla may also be prevented from opening up service centers in Michigan and other states that have banned direct sales. Consumers living in Michigan can still buy a Tesla online. And some committed consumers have. Tesla says they try to accommodate these owners by sending “rangers,” basically roving mechanics from service centers in nearby states. Tesla owners in Michigan might receive service from a ranger based in Cleveland, Ohio.

This roving mechanic service works for now. But it will be unsustainable if Tesla’s upcoming mass-market Model 3 vehicle is as successful as early reservations suggest.

Tesla Deliveries Rise 70% in the Third Quarter

That leaves Tesla less than two years to resolve the matter. It’s pursuing this in two ways: legislation and litigation. State Rep. Aaron Miller introduced a bill in February that would allow Tesla Motors to sell its electric vehicles in the state with some restrictions to protect dealerships. That bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is now in legislative limbo, where it will likely remain.

Tesla also applied for a “Class A” license, which would have allowed the automaker to open a company-owned dealership in the state. At the time, the company told Fortune it didn’t expect it to be approved and instead had done this to test the limits of the state law that prevents it from selling vehicles there. Michigan officials rejected Tesla’s license request in September.

A week later, Tesla filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan Southern Division."
https://www.thedailybeast.com/workers-say-tesla-is-trying-to-scare-them-out-of-a-union,pos,1.0,3.0616371624878247e-20,Workers: Building Teslas for Elon Musk Is Hell,2017-08-11 05:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:17.309613,Kelly Weill,"Elon Musk and many of his employees at his Tesla factory agree on one point: Work is hell.

For Musk, the billionaire CEO of the electric car company, that hell is a technical inconvenience. Tesla, which currently sells a small number of high-end cars, recently announced its plans to massively increase production and enter the mass market with its Model 3 car. “Frankly, we’re going to be in production hell,” Musk told Tesla employees during a July 28 announcement. “For at least six months, maybe longer.”

For a number of Tesla factory workers who are currently trying to unionize, hell feels like herniated neck disks, carpal tunnel, and tendinitis.

“Having to look up every day, 12 hours a day, six days a week, hands over my shoulder, it was two herniated disks in my neck,” Michael Sanchez told The Daily Beast. He has since moved to less-intensive work on door panels. “After three-plus years working at Tesla, it just starts adding on until you’re living the pain every day. Whether you’re off work or not.”

Tesla casts itself as the eco-friendly car of the future, but the tech company still depends on the physical labor of workers who assemble vehicles in its factory in Fremont, California. As the company enters a production blitz, some of these workers are demanding a union, citing a high rate of past injuries.

So when factory workers started murmuring about a union last summer, Sanchez got on board. But a year out, while Tesla shifts into high gear, its union drive is still stalling.

“The main thing that’s holding it back is the fear. The fear of people not aware what their rights are,” Sanchez said. “But what Tesla feeds them during meetings is the thought that ‘maybe I’ll lose my job, or maybe I’ll lose my opportunity for a lead.’”

Tesla management has a ready-made warning of the worst-case scenario for unionized car factories. Its Fremont factory used to be the site of NUMMI, a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors, which shuttered in 2010, after General Motors declared bankruptcy and pulled out of the partnership. The plant had been Toyota’s only unionized factory in the U.S. Tesla snapped up the 5.5 million-square-foot building for just $42 million—a Great Recession bargain on a plant previously valued at $1.3 billion.

“They retaliate just by telling people that the union is worthless,” Sanchez said, “that they’re the ones that ruined NUMMI. And it’s not true.” In a phone call with The Daily Beast, a Tesla representative also suggested that NUMMI’s union might have contributed to its closure.

Tesla’s anti-union push has played out in arguments between workers and managers on the factory floor, pro-union employee Alan Ochoa said.

“Every time we go out there and try to hand out flyers, security comes and talks to us for 20 to 30 minutes, takes our badges, makes sure we’re employees of the factory,” Ochoa told The Daily Beast. “Sometimes people from HR come, and they don’t hold back on their opinions on the matter.”

Asked about the workers’ allegations, a Tesla spokesperson provided The Daily Beast with a statement from February.

“As California’s largest manufacturing employer and a company that has created thousands of quality jobs here in the Bay Area, this is not the first time we have been the target of a professional union organizing effort such as this,” the spokesperson said. “The safety and job satisfaction of our employees here at Tesla has always been extremely important to us. We have a long history of engaging directly with our employees on the issues that matter to them, and we will continue to do so because it’s the right thing to do.”

It’s illegal for employers to directly threaten to close a factory if workers unionize, but employers can imply that unionization forced other plants into closure, according to labor lawyer David Rosenfeld of UC-Berkeley. He pointed to a Mississippi Nissan plant where workers voted last week not to unionize. In a video to workers, Nissan appeared to imply that unionizing would kill jobs; on a local radio broadcast, an unnamed interviewee warned that the plant’s predominantly black workforce would go back to “picking cotton” if they unionized.

“You can’t say ‘we’ll take action if you unionize,’ but you can say ‘look what happened in other facilities,’” Rosenfeld told The Daily Beast. “You can’t say ‘if you support the union, you won’t be promoted,’ but you can say ‘supervisors don’t support the union.’ It’s a lot of innuendo.”

But some tactics went too far, the United Automobile Workers union alleged. In April, the UAW filed four separate complaints against Tesla on these workers’ behalf, accusing Tesla of “intimidating [and] creating the appearance of surveillance and conducting surveillance on [employees] and others for their union activities and/or union sentiments,” allegedly in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Tesla “instruct[ed] employees that they were not allowed to pass out any literature unless it was pre-approved by the Employer,” the filing continues.

Tesla denounced the filings as “entirely without merit.”

If the employees were distributing literature on the factory floor, Tesla would have been within its rights to interfere, Rosenfeld said, but “workers have the right to do it in non-work area, lunchrooms, break rooms, sometimes hallways, parking lots, smoking areas.”

But some of Tesla’s anti-union push has been personal. After a quiet beginning, the union campaign burst into the public when Tesla worker Jose Moran penned a February blog post calling for a union and lambasting Tesla for its record on worker injuries.

“Preventable injuries happen often. In addition to long working hours, machinery is often not ergonomically compatible with our bodies,” Moran wrote. “There is too much twisting and turning and extra physical movement to do jobs that could be simplified if workers’ input were welcomed… A few months ago, six out of eight people in my work team were out on medical leave at the same time due to various work-related injuries.”

Musk accused Moran of being a “guy [who] was paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union. He doesn’t really work for us, he works for the UAW.” The UAW denied Musk’s claims and demanded he apologize to Moran. He has not.

Meanwhile, in an email to employees, Musk slammed the union drive, claiming that the UAW’s “true allegiance is to the giant car companies… This is David vs Goliath if David were six inches tall!” Musk wrote of his company.

In response to employee grievances, Musk promised “fun” factory perks “like free frozen yogurt stands scattered around the factory and my personal favorite: a Tesla electric pod car roller coaster (with an optional loop the loop route, of course!)” he wrote to employees in February. “We are going to hold a really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year.”

Pro-union employees said their demands were safety, not soft-serve. Shortly before Moran’s blog post, Ochoa had received a grim diagnosis: the carpal tunnel he’d received on the job was labeled “permanent,” forcing him into medical leave.

The injury, which left him unable to even change gears in his car was “like what I imagine arthritis feels like: all your joints in pain,” he said.

Tesla’s past rate of injury has been a rallying point for pro-union workers.

“In 2015, the last full year for which data is available, we had an injury rate that was far higher than the industry average,” pro-union employees wrote in an open letter on July 31, days after Musk made his Model 3 announcement. “For that year, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that our injury rate was higher than that of sawmills and slaughter houses.”

For that year, Tesla had an injury rate 31 percent higher than industry average, and a serious injury rate 103 percent higher, according to a study pro-union workers commissioned from Tesla’s OSHA reports.

Tesla management said things have changed.

“We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future and with the changes we’ve made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far,” a Tesla spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “Our goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry.”

Tesla said it had since made safety improvements that reduced injuries 30 by percent in 2016. “In addition, through the end of Q1 2017, the factory’s total recordable incident rate... is 32% better than the industry average,” the company wrote in a statement.

The pro-union report argued that Tesla’s most recent data was “too preliminary to be considered accurate given Tesla’s erratic reporting patterns.”

Indeed, these injuries occurred when Tesla had relatively a low output. Tesla has been a luxury car company until the roll-out of the $35,000 Model 3. Last year, the company delivered less than 80,000 vehicles to buyers. Next year, Tesla plans to build 500,000 cars.

In addition to new equipment, Tesla will build parts of the new cars at a separate facility, distributing the workload across more employees. But workers like Sanchez remain skeptical.

When he started working with Tesla in 2012, employees worked 14 hours a day to produce 90 cars he claimed. New hires cut the work day down to eight hours, but “There’s no realistic way than going up through 12 hours,” he said. “That’s just to try to hit those numbers.”

If Sanchez feels squeezed, so does his boss. Confronted with Tesla’s injury rate earlier this year, Musk said the company was working to improve on a razor-thin budget.

“We’re a money-losing company,” Musk, who is worth $15 billion, told The Guardian in May. “This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It’s just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?”

But said Sanchez believes the factory is headed toward unionization.

“The thing is, they dream about the future, but they dream a little too soon,” he said of management. “In the process, they have all their workers bust their ass, and in return we get almost nothing.”"
http://fortune.com/2017/10/04/tesla-model-3-gm-all-electric/,pos,1.0,3.1474169725265975e-18,Tesla's Biggest Competitor in the Electric Car Revolution? It Might Be Detroit,2017-10-04 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:18.162225,Aric Jenkins,"Several months ago, when Elon Musk touted a “handover party” for the Tesla Model 3’s first 30 buyers, the future of Tesla’s first mass market electric car seemed bright. Musk, Tesla’s CEO, estimated that production would grow “exponentially,” with the automaker producing at least 1,500 cars a month by September, and 20,000 by December.

But as of Monday, just 260 Tesla Model 3’s had been produced. And only 220 of those had been delivered.

That’s 84% below the target. And on the same day that Tesla revealed its “less than anticipated” production volume, General Motors, the largest automaker in the country, announced its plans to roll out 20 new all-electric models by 2023, including two that are set to arrive within 18 months. It’s all part of GM’s aim for an “all-electric future,” and the move follows a similar initiative from fellow Detroit-based automaker Ford, which is working on 13 new electrified models ranging from hybrid F-150s to a fully-electric SUV by 2020.

Musk doesn’t appear to be sweating the competition. He even retweeted a Wired story detailing GM’s bold new objective. And Tesla as a whole professes itself unbothered. “It is important to emphasize that there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,” the company said in a statement. “We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.”

But even if Tesla recovers—at least one industry analyst told Fortune there’s no cause for panic yet—and starts delivering high quantities of Model 3’s in the coming years, it will be tough for the company to make an impact on the market if larger, more established automakers like GM throw all their weight behind electric-powered cars. Tesla will likely continue to appeal to its trifecta of wealthy, environmentally-conscious, early tech-adopting crowds. But in terms of creating a a truly mass market electric car for the middle-class, industry analysts say, manufacturers like GM and Ford are in a much better position.

The Detroit automakers have “much deeper pockets” and significantly more capacity to crank out more units, said David Whiston, an equity strategist for U.S. automobiles at investment research and management firm Morningstar. Tesla would have to scale up its production—by a lot—and that would cost an enormous amount of money.

“I don’t see how it’s possible,” Whiston said. “Over 90 million cars are sold a year. Tesla’s going to sell a bit over a million cars in maybe a decade?”

That number could be contingent on the options put forth by Tesla’s competitors. GM developed the hybrid Chevrolet Volt long before Tesla unveiled the Model 3. Then the all-electric Chevy Bolt arrived at the end of 2016. And while the Bolt and Model 3’s starting prices are nearly identical, the Model 3 has been criticized as a bait-and-switch since the true cost runs about $10,000 more than its advertised $35,000 with features like autopilot or a longer-lasting battery.

“I think when you look back at our history and where we’ve been in this space, when we started off with the first generation Chevy Volt, I would say we don’t try to play catchup to anybody else because we’ve been leading in this space,” Kevin Kelly, senior manager of advanced technology communications at GM, told Fortune. “We will continue to be at the forefront to develop EVs.”

But Tesla does have two things going for it that GM or Ford can’t boast at this moment: a generally well-liked celebrity CEO, and a scheme to pay back the same customers who purchase its vehicles.

Dubbed the “Tesla Network” by Musk, the idea is to create a “shared autonomy fleet” that allows Tesla owners to lend out their cars, Uber-style, once the automaker’s “full self-driving” update goes live. If successful, Whiston said, Tesla could come away as a winner in the electric market. But if Musk is “overestimating people’s willingness to part with their cars for a few hours,” people would be less willing to pay for Model 3’s, Whiston said. Not to mention competition from the likes of Ford, which is developing its own autonomous fleet.

“The Model 3 ramp represents an exciting opportunity for Tesla and its shareholders,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, “but we continue to believe that the next 6-12 months will see a steady and intensifying flow of competitive efforts from very large and well-capitalized firms that will be making increasingly conspicuous efforts to encroach on Tesla’s territory of highly safe, automated, electric transport.”

Even as a showdown of sorts seems to be brewing in the electric vehicle market, heavyweight GM says it is not looking to demolish competition like Tesla. “As we look to the strategy we’re moving forward with—zero emissions, zero crashes, zero congestion—anyone who is working on that reality, we welcome that,” Kelly said. That attitude was probably shared by Musk when he retweeted news about GM’s plans to compete in a market that he popularized.

But perhaps that will be Musk and Tesla’s ultimate legacy. While GM and Ford (not to mention the German and Japanese auto powerhouses) may have more clout to usher in the era of mainstream electric vehicles, Tesla made it cool.

Maybe it won’t lead the electric revolution when it’s all said in done. But it definitely started it."

They share company co-founder Elon Musk’s vision of ending the 130-year reign of the internal combustion engine by steering drivers away from gasoline and toward electricity.

But hold on to your smugness, Tesla owners. Not all electric cars are the same, and until the U.S. more fully embraces renewable energy sources, buying an electric car isn’t necessarily the greenest option out there. In fact, some hybrid vehicles can be greener options than fully electric cars, according to people who study the sources of carbon emissions that cause global warming. (Sorry climate deniers, you’ve lost that debate.)

Advertisement:

Important factors in determining carbon emissions include the weight of the vehicle, driving habits, and the source of the electricity that charges your car. Likewise, it can be a much greener choice to keep the perfectly functional car you have, rather than go out and buy a new one.

“If you are a relatively low-mileage person, you should stick with your gas-powered car,” Mike Berners-Lee, a leading expert in measuring the amount of greenhouse gases released by the products we buy, told Salon. “When the time comes to buy a new car, you should buy a nice, small electric car, and you should still keep the mileage down. You should still try to find other forms of transport when you can, and you should share transportation as much as you can.”

One of the reasons why buying a new car is a problem is the vehicle’s so-called embodied carbon, meaning all of the energy that was used to build the car from scratch — including the extraction and processing of raw materials, and shipping parts and vehicles across oceans in filthy bunker-fuel burning cargo ships. Every time you roll off the dealer’s lot in a new set of wheels — electrified or not — your personal carbon footprint grows immensely.

Berners-Lee, the British author of “How Bad are Bananas?: The Carbon Footprint of Everything,” calculated that making one midsize sedan like the Ford Mondeo (known in the U.S. as the Ford Fusion) generates about 17 metric tons of carbon dioxide; three year’s worth of gas and electricity consumed by a typical British household produces about the same amount. In general, the amount of carbon it takes to manufacture a car scales depending on its mass: an SUV like the Land Rover Discovery creates about twice the carbon yield of the Ford Mondeo merely in production, where as a compact car only yields about 6 metric tons of carbon.

Electric cars aren’t much different than gas-burning vehicles in this regard. In fact, the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that it takes about 15 percent more embodied carbon to produce an electric vehicle (EV) than it does to manufacture a gasoline-powered car, largely because of the materials and fabrication processes used to make the battery packs.

“For a full-size [electric] car, it can be a higher percentage increase in the emissions” of embodied carbon, David Reichmuth, senior engineer in the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Salon.

However, Reichmuth is quick to point out that while an electric car is modestly more polluting to manufacture, it more than makes up for the difference over the life of the vehicle. A study Reichmuth co-authored and released in 2015 shows that by the time a mid-size electric car hits 135,000 miles, it will have produced half of the emissions of a comparable gasoline-powered sedan.

Electric car emissions are measured using the carbon output of electrical power plants. Since most electric power is generated from fossil fuels, electric cars contribute to greenhouse gas emissions unless all of the electricity they consume comes from renewable sources like wind and solar.

“The principles need to be that we make the cars as efficient as we can, and part of that is moving to electric,” Reichmuth said. “We need to make the fuels as clean as we can and that means shifting oil to electricity, and electricity that’s made without emissions.”

So, if you own an electric car and you keep it for years, then you’re doing the best you can, right?

Advertisement:

Well, not necessarily, says John Scofield, a professor of physics at Oberlin College. “The more weight you add to a car, the more rolling resistance,” Scofield told Salon.

There’s an immense difference in efficiency between a 5,400-pound electric SUV like the Tesla Model X and a plug-in gas-electric hybrid like the Chevrolet Volt, which weighs nearly 2,000 pounds less. While the Volt can travel only about 50 miles on battery power alone before the gasoline engine kicks in, it utilizes energy more efficiently because it has less weight to pull around.

Scofield, who in 2012 testified to a House subcommittee meeting on energy efficiency, also pointed out that the more people drive electric cars, the less renewable energy is available. Because of the way utilities trade power across state lines, even if you live in a city like Seattle that receives most of its electricity from renewables, you might still be sometimes tapping power provided from fossil fuels.

Advertisement:

“Nobody in Seattle is making more hydroelectric power,” he said. “If you didn’t use the electricity [from a renewable source] it was going somewhere else.” But as demand for electricity increases beyond what can be provided by a renewable energy source at any given time, the grid has to be supported with power from non-sustainable sources. “The replacement energy will come from burning gas. People don’t get that,” Scofield added.

There are numerous reasons why a plug-in hybrid may actually be greener than an electric car. For those supremely interested in owning an eco-friendly vehicle, the most important factor is weight; the heavier and bigger the car, the more energy you’re wasting. Another major factor is whether you need to buy a new car at all. Because of the embodied carbon issue, it is better to get a few more years of life out of your gas-powered car, rather than buy a new electric car, according to Berners-Lee.

“We need to make the most of our embodied carbon,” he said. “It’s no good being fashion freaks with our cars. It just doesn’t work environmentally. You have to buy a lightweight quality car, take care of it and keep it on the road.”

And of course, drive it as little as possible when other options are available. Or better yet, embrace public transit or car sharing and help save the world by reducing the number of cars in it — electric or otherwise."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/business/tesla-story-stocks.html,pos,0.9997991403115467,0.00020085968841611522,Tesla Has Something Hotter Than Cars to Sell: Its Story,2017-04-06 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:26.041239,James B. Stewart,"And while many investors’ memories tend to be short, the so-called dot-com bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten.

Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, “Stories are compelling.” They appeal to intuition rather than reason. “But perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus’s example of putting beeswax in his crew’s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song.”

Will Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world’s most valuable company?

The company has won over many skeptics with its near-flawless execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a start-up: It delivered 25,000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits.

But that’s not the Tesla story — or stories — investors are betting on.

Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a starry-eyed optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company’s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected “vehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla’s upcoming product offensive,” referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla’s new, lower-price Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology.

That Tesla is an all-electric, environmentally friendly, nonfossil-fuel vehicle — the story that once excited investors — is barely mentioned anymore.

Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely self-driving, able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla’s high-speed battery-charging stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla’s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber’s nascent market dominance."

As I write this, Tesla is worth $51 billion, compared with $50 billion for GM and $45 billion for Ford.

At first glance, that doesn’t make any sense. Ford sold 6.6 million vehicles in 2016 and earned $4.6 billion for the year. GM sold 10 million cars in 2016 and earned $9.4 billion. Tesla shipped a comparatively tiny 76,000 vehicles and recorded a loss of $675 million.

The fact that Tesla’s stock is worth more than Ford’s and about as much as GM’s is a sign that Wall Street envisions very different trajectories for the two companies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set aggressive growth goals for his company, aiming to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018 and close to 1 million vehicles by 2020. But even if Musk meets these targets — and that’s a big if — that still wouldn’t justify valuing Tesla more highly than Ford or GM, which already sell millions of vehicles every year.

So the relatively low market prices of Ford and GM seems to also be a signal that investors are pessimistic about these Detroit auto companies’ prospects. Many observers expect that over the next decade or two, the car industry will shift from human-driven, gasoline-powered cars to software-driven electric vehicles. Car companies believe they’ll be able to navigate this transition gracefully, but Wall Street doesn’t seem to believe it.

Wall Street sees Tesla, not classic companies like Ford and GM, as the future of cars.

Tesla is aiming to be the Apple of the car business

To understand what the market might be thinking, it’s worth remembering what happened in the cellphone industry a decade ago. Back in 2007, the cellphone market was dominated by Nokia with 435 million units, followed by Motorola with 164 million units. Apple released the first iPhone that year, but it sold fewer than 4 million units.

So it would have been easy for a naive analyst at the time to dismiss Apple as a minor player. What that analyst would have missed, of course, was that the nature of cellphones was about to change. The kind of old-fashioned “feature phones” that accounted for the bulk of Nokia’s sales was about to be rendered obsolete by the iPhone and a new wave of Android-based smartphones.

Nokia executives weren’t too worried. They didn’t have the iPhone, but they had plenty of engineers and strong relationships with mobile network operators around the world. They assumed they’d be able to build a rival smartphone operating system and be a major player in the smartphone business.

But making an iPhone-quality smartphone proved to be harder than they expected, and Nokia was caught flat-footed. Efforts to create its own software floundered, and a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone software failed to gain traction. The company was forced to sell its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2014 — a humiliating end for a company that once led the cellphone industry.

We don’t know if something like this is in the cards for Ford and GM, but it would be one way to explain why Tesla is so highly valued in comparison. Executives in Detroit think they can easily pivot to making electric, software-driven cars, just as Nokia thought it could adapt to a smartphone world.

Apple sells 20 percent of smartphones and earns most of the profits

One other important lesson from the smartphone world is that profits in a high-tech industry are sometimes much more skewed than market share. Apple sells fewer than 20 percent of the world’s smartphones. But the fact that the company makes both the hardware and software for the iPhone helps it stand apart in the marketplace, allowing it to charge a much bigger premium than its Android-based rivals. The result: Despite the iPhone’s modest market share, Apple’s quarterly profits often dwarf the profits of all other smartphone makers combined.

Like Apple, Tesla makes many components of its cars, from batteries to self-driving software, in house. Its roots in Silicon Valley mean that the software on its cars is likely to be better than software produced by companies like Ford or GM — a factor that will become even more important as self-driving technology becomes a significant factor in the industry.

Like Apple, Tesla has a significant base of ardent fans who follow its every move and are eager to buy its new products.

Tesla’s big bet on batteries could pay off handsomely

Tesla is also aiming to duplicate another of Apple’s key strategies: making big investments to lock in its supply of key components. One of Tesla’s big bets is on batteries. Electric cars need a lot of lithium ion batteries, and over the years Tesla has struggled to find suppliers to meet its needs. So a few years ago Tesla broke ground on the Gigafactory, a facility in Nevada that will supply the company with batteries on a massive scale.

Musk is betting that the Gigafactory will give him a big head start over rivals. He’s hoping economies of scale will make Tesla’s batteries cheaper than those from third parties. And as other car companies rush to build electric cars, they’ll discover there aren’t enough batteries to go around, making it hard for car companies to expand electric car production as quickly as Tesla can.

Obviously, it’s too early to say if this theory is right. Musk hasn’t even managed to produce an electric car that’s affordable to normal people — his $35,000 Model 3 is scheduled to begin production later this year. But Tesla’s stock price suggests that Wall Street is optimistic about Tesla’s chances."

One is an automotive titan that has built more than 350m vehicles in an illustrious history spanning more than a century.

The other is less than 15 years old and has never made a profit.

And yet a 7% surge in the value of shares in electric car firm Tesla on Monday saw it zoom ahead of Ford Motor Company, in terms of its stock market value.

As Wall Street closed for the day, Tesla, led by 45-year-old tycoon and futurist Elon Musk, was worth $49bn (£38bn), compared with a paltry $46bn for the empire built by Henry Ford.

This astonishing overtaking manoeuvre says as much about the nature of stock markets as it does about these two very different carmakers.

The old cliche among stock market investors is that you should “buy on the rumour, sell on the fact” – the idea that investment is more about what you expect to happen in the future than the current state of play.

And Tesla, investors believe, is the standard-bearer of a battery-powered future – while Ford is the archetypal mass-production legacy car business.

Based in the Californian tech hub of Palo Alto, Tesla delivered 76,230 cars last year – a fraction of Ford’s 6.65m.

It made sales of $7bn but a loss of $746m, while Ford recorded a $10.4bn profit after racking up sales of $152bn.



But fresh figures published this week, which cover the most recent three months, showed 70% growth in sales at Tesla, with 25,000 electric vehicles rolling noiselessly into the garages of their new owners.

That sort of growth rate is what sent investors piling into Tesla shares, expecting a continued global push for greener cars to be the catalyst for converting notional value into concrete returns.

And if Musk is to to be believed, Tesla won’t be slowing down any time soon.

The firm’s production targets are unprecedented in the automotive industry. Tesla has set a goal of building 500,000 cars in 2018 and Musk has even raised the prospect of doubling that to 1m by 2020.

Despite the setback of a fatal crash last year, when a Tesla on autopilot failed to tell the difference between the side of a white lorry and a bright sky, the company continues to make strides towards a fully driverless car.

Its new Model 3, slated for production this year, is intended to offer a more affordable version of previous models, with a price tag around $35,000.

If successful – and it is being seen as a litmus test of the prospects for electric cars – the Model 3 could supercharge Tesla’s growth by muscling in on the territory of mass market rivals.

The firm also has a potentially lucrative sideline in storage batteries for the home. The Powerwall is intended to allow homes to store solar power, and Tesla is also due to start installing its first solar roof tiles this year.

Tesla may be on a charge, but Ford is in particularly bad shape. It remains in the world’s top 10 auto firms and is also among the US “Big Three” alongside General Motors and Chrysler. But while Tesla’s sales are soaring, the 6.65m vehicles that Ford sold last year were just 16,000 up on 2015 sales. In the most recent quarterly update from Ford, sales actually fell.

The company that helped to build Detroit, often known as Motor City, sold 1.7m cars in the quarter, about 68,000 fewer than in the same period the previous year.

Musk was in the mood to gloat about Tesla’s comparatively rapid growth story.

“Stormy weather in Shortville,” he tweeted, a reference to traders who had been burned by “shorting” Tesla – betting its results would disappoint and its shares would fall.

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Stormy weather in Shortville ...

He gave short shrift to sceptical commentators, too.

Veteran technology journalist Walt Mossberg, now executive editor of media network The Verge, said on Twitter: “I admire Tesla and @elonmusk,” he said, “but this is the billionth example of why stock market valuations don’t reflect reality.”

That, replied Musk, is precisely the point. He tweeted: “Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that’s irrelevant.A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.”

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) @ForIn2020 @waltmossberg @mims @defcon_5 Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.

Michelle Krebs, a Detroit-based senior analyst with Autotrader, sounded a rare note of caution. “Investors are betting on the future, which they think is promising and they’re looking at the stock to make big gains,” she said.

“But there will come a day that Tesla has to make money and the Model 3 is a test of that. It will make or break whether Tesla can be a volume manufacturer that appeals to a wide swath of consumers and whether it can be profitable or not.

“One of the big risks that Tesla will face is increased competition. Everyone from General Motors with the Chevrolet Bolt to BMW and Mercedes are being aggressive on electric cars. They will face increasing competition as established players and upstarts come into the market.”

But South-African born Musk doesn’t really do caution. He bought into Tesla at an early stage after making his fortune through the development of tech businesses including PayPal, which made him $165m when it was sold to eBay for $1.5bn.

He has since amassed a fortune of $14bn, as well as a reputation for seemingly fantastical visions of the future. The founder of private space exploration company SpaceX, he has pledged to slash the cost of space travel to help the human race survive by colonising Mars and other planets.

“Either we spread Earth to other planets, or we risk going extinct,” he told a conference in 2013. An extinction event is inevitable and we’re increasingly doing ourselves in,” he said.

Last week, the company became the first to launch a partially recycled rocket into space, in what Musk termed “a milestone in the history of space”.

He also conceived the Hyperloop, a transport system he says could whizz people between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 30 minutes at speeds of up to 700mph (1,126 km/h).

Bold ambition and market-pleasing bombast have become the currency of a man with a knack for marrying technology and glamour, generating global excitement among his legions of fans and admirers.

The fact that Tesla should be valued more highly than Henry Ford’s century-spanning mother of all carmakers suggests that Musk’s zealous disciples are not the only ones who believe the hype.

Maurizio Pesce / Wikimedia Commons Tesla is having a big week.

The automaker is now bigger than Ford in market cap. Tesla was even on the verge of surpassing GM in market cap on Tuesday. It's a big deal for a company that has sought to contend with traditional car manufacturers.

Not too long ago, many doubted Tesla's ability to survive producing electric vehicles. Fast forward to 2017, and Tesla is advancing autonomous tech, producing two luxury cars, selling commercial batteries on a mass scale, and about to foray into solar installations.

CEO Elon Musk has transformed Tesla from a small startup in Palo Alto, California, into an enviable competitor in the auto industry.

But as Musk said on Twitter, Tesla's market-cap growth says more about where people see the company heading than its past accomplishments. And Tesla's next big move could also be its greatest weakness going forward: the launch of the Model 3, its first mass-market sedan priced at $35,000 before federal tax incentives.

My colleague Matt DeBord has written extensively on this topic. Musk is launching the Model 3 at a time when demand for sedans is waning. Gone are the days where people bought smaller cars to contend with higher gas prices. Gas is cheap, and it will likely stay that way as President Donald Trump prepares to roll back fuel-emissions standards.

SUVs are currently the most lucrative segment in the auto industry. Both compact and mid-size crossover SUVs account for 35% of all cars and trucks sold in the United States. (It's why companies looking to enter the electric-car space are starting with an electric SUV.)

Even Tesla is experiencing that uptick in SUV demand — the company delivered roughly the same number of Model X SUVs (11,550) as it did its more traditionally popular Model S sedans (13,450) in the first quarter.

Couple that with the fact that it's much harder to generate a profit on a mass-market sedan, and you can see how Tesla could have a problem. Tesla is entering a market that isn't growing and could take a greater toll on its bottom line.

The Model 3 will surely be a hit when it rolls off the assembly line at the end of this year — after all, Tesla already has sold about 400,000 of the electric cars.

But it's a matter of what happens when that initial surge of excitement disappears. Can Tesla truly handle the transition from luxury to consumer-friendly?

It doesn't help that Tesla generally has struggled to meet its delivery goals because of production issues. The Model S was supposed to roll out in 2010 but was delayed to mid-2011. The Model X suffered three years of delays.

""We were in production hell,"" Musk said on the company's second-quarter 2016 earnings call. ""We climbed out of hell in June.""

But Musk is preparing accordingly to ensure the Model 3 launch goes off without any hiccups. In November, Tesla bought a German automation company to help speed up assembly-line production. Tesla also temporarily shut down its factory in Fremont, California, in February to prepare it for Model 3 production.

Tesla delivered a record 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2017.

The electric-car maker also has a better cash cushion after raising $1.2 billion in March.

Tesla's market-cap valuation signals a huge vote of confidence in the company. Musk will have to seamlessly transition into the mass-market space — not just in the first year, but in the long run — to meet those expectations."

La Monica,"Move over, Ford. Tesla is now the second most valuable car company in America.

Tesla's stock surged nearly 6% on Monday to an all-time high after the maker of electric cars reported strong sales of its Model S and Model X vehicles. Ford's shares sank 3% following a weak sales report for March.

As a result, Ford's (F) market value is about $45 billion, while Tesla's (TSLA) has climbed to almost $48 billion.

Tesla also inched closer to GM (GM), whose stock fell 4% after it reported both a sales increase that was well below forecasts and higher inventories. GM's market value is $50.8 billion. And Tesla is not far behind Japan's Honda (HMC). It's worth about $54 billion.

Shares of GM and Ford are now both lower for the year, while Tesla's stock has soared more than 35%.

Tesla doesn't sell nearly as many cars as Ford, GM or Honda -- or other auto giants like Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF).

Tesla said Sunday that it sold about 25,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles worldwide in the first quarter. Ford sold more than 617,000 just in the United States. GM sold nearly 690,000 cars and trucks in the first three months.

And Tesla, unlike GM and Ford, is still losing money. It's expected to report a loss for the next few quarters and all of 2017.

But investors seem excited about Tesla's upcoming Model 3 car, which could help make Tesla a more mainstream auto company instead of just a luxury electric car maker.

The Model 3, which is expected to be available later this year, should cost about $35,000 -- significantly less than the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.

Last year, Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it had already received 373,000 pre-orders for the Model 3. The company hasn't updated those figures.

Tesla isn't the only company making a cheaper electric car, though. It's going to face tough competition from GM, which has the Bolt, and from Nissan (NSANF) and its Leaf.

Tesla also has a lot on its plate in the next few months and years as the company seeks to integrate its recent acquisition of SolarCity -- a company run by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

An analyst at Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla to a ""sell"" rating at the end of February because of concerns about the SolarCity deal and about how much Tesla plans to spend on three more of its Gigafactories for battery and solar panel production.

Tesla already has one plant for batteries in Nevada and another in Buffalo, New York, for solar panels.

Musk could also be distracted by the many other projects he's involved with, most notably his rocket company (and perennially rumored IPO candidate) SpaceX.

Related: Meet Tesla's new China backer: A tech giant with nearly a billion users

Of course, the Goldman analyst has been dead wrong so far. The stock is up nearly 20% since the ""sell"" recommendation.

The shares got a boost last week after Chinese tech giant Tencent announced it was taking a 5% stake in the company.

So could Tesla one day become the most valuable car company in the world? In addition to Ford, it's already passed Nissan and Fiat Chrysler. If it tops GM, next up among the major global brands would be VW, which is currently worth about $70 billion.

After that, it's a long road before Tesla could top the number one car company. Toyota's market value is $160 billion.

But Musk might not even be satisfied if Tesla gets to that level. Two years ago, he boldly predicted that Tesla could one day be worth as much as Apple (AAPL). Apple was worth $700 billion at the time and is now worth about $750 billion.

Musk will have to sell a lot of Model 3s and solar roofs to get there."
https://www.wired.com/2016/11/tesla-grows-gives-free-charging/,pos,0.9999999998512223,1.4879106788445128e-10,Tesla Motors End Free Access to Superchargers,2016-11-07 23:39:01,2019-06-24 14:20:31.746697,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"Tesla offers a good sales pitch: Gorgeous cars, ludicrous acceleration, features like Autopilot that arrive via over the air updates. And to sweeten the deal for those who can afford the luxury electric, free charging at the young automaker's international network of Supercharger stations.

Since 2012, Tesla has invited its customers to plug in to chargers that add 200 to 300 miles of range per hour. Good enough to top up a depleted battery in about 30 minutes, while a driver has a bathroom break and a bite to eat. They approach the convenience of pumping gas into a conventional car, and they're free for life.

Not any more: Starting next year, new Tesla buyers hoping to plug in will have to pony up. But this isn't Tesla giving up on its promises or Elon turning Ebenezer. This is Tesla growing up—along with the American electric vehicle industry.

Supercharging Comes at a Price

As of January 1, 2017, anyone who orders a Tesla will get just 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits per year, good for about 1,000 miles of driving. Tesla has not revealed how much it will cost after that limit, but says in a blog post the ""small fee"" will be cheaper than buying gas. Folks who ordered their car before then still get to charge for free, for life. (That doesn't count the 373,000 people who have put down $1,000 to reserve a Model 3—that's a deposit, not an order.)

Tesla plans to use the new income to build new Superchargers (it's running 734 worldwide, with 4605 charging points), but the simple fact of demanding money for their use could do more than expand the network.

You see, some Tesla owners have treated the free lunch more like an all you can eat buffet. It’s not unusual to see a queue of Model S and X cars waiting to get their electron fix at busy locations. In an August 2015 letter, Tesla chided owners for over-using Superchargers instead of doing their day-to-day charging at home.

""Anytime you give something away for free, it’s harder to manage,"" says Art Wheaton, who studies the auto industry at Cornell University's Worker Institute. Asking for even a small dollar amount per fill should encourage people to only take what they need. “It will help manage the lines,” says Wheaton. As Tesla keeps selling cars, that's crucial to maintaining a positive user experience.

Plus, these things are expensive. “Having a supercharger turn on is like putting five to 10 US homes on the grid,” says Paul Mutolo, an energy storage chemist at Cornell University. Having a bunch of cars charging at once leads to a big spike in power demand, and that leads to big bills from utility companies. “Their demand charges have got to be quite hefty,” says Mutolo.

Making money could allow Tesla to build Superchargers more in line with CEO Elon Musk’s vision for sustainable transport, with solar panels and batteries to store energy and buffer demand, cutting costs at the same time.

More Chargers Are Coming

Today's problems with offering free charging stand to get far worse as Tesla morphs from a niche luxury car maker to a mass manufacturer. Elon Musk will sell about 100,00 cars this year; he wants to produce half a million cars a year by 2020.

In any case, Tesla has outgrown the need to offer Supercharger use gratis. The automaker first made the deal when at a time when range anxiety limited EV sales. Most Americans wouldn’t buy a car that couldn't handle a road trip, even if they drove fewer than 40 miles a day. Telling them they could charge quickly, right off the highway, and at no cost was a clever way to soothe concerns and drive sales.

Now, that's less of an issue. The Model S goes farther than ever on a charge and is no longer the only electric car you'd even think of taking out of the city and onto on the highway. Musk faces competition from the likes of the the more affordable Chevrolet Bolt, with over 200 miles of range.

Meanwhile, non-Tesla infrastructure is catching up. BMW and VW are building a network of fast chargers. The Obama Administration is funding a network of ""electric vehicle charging corridors."" Tesla and the EV market are mature enough to shed the need for free charging.

Tesla has long believed you should charge your car the way you power your phone: Plug it in at work, at home, anytime you’re not using it. But if you’re anything like me, your phone still runs out of juice at inopportune moments. The Supercharger network is a terrific failsafe, but it does little good if Tesla can't keep it useful and practical as it slowly grows up."

The lead character Shawn, played by Bridger Zadina, makes an eight-hour journey from Los Angeles up to Santa Cruz. Shawn, who is too young to have a driver’s license, steals the car from parents’ garage in an act of rebellion and desperate teenage desire: he needed an escape route to reach his crush. There’s a scene that depicts his journey, window-down, wind whipping, as the gigantic 17-inch Tesla screen guides him on his journey up the Pacific Coastal Highway 1, a symbolic break away from the control of his helicopter scientist parents. The only snafu: because he’s driving a Tesla, mom and dad can track his whereabouts using the Tesla app from a phone.

I was in Tesla country

Two weeks ago, I drove a Tesla Model S P100D along the California coast in a similar racy red hue. I was commuting from San Francisco to Pebble Beach and back for Monterey Car Week, and I also took the long way, toward Highway 1, one of the world’s most fantastic roads. To get there, I made my way from the clogged Silicon Valley suburbs onto a two-lane, twisty road surrounded by pine trees, through a bit of mountainous terrain, and at last, onto wide stretches of road on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Monterey is north of Big Sur, the section of Pacific Coast Highway that’s still closed for repairs after a massive landslide wiped a chunk of it away.

It’s one of the best weeks to drive to Monterey Peninsula, because of the classic car eye candy that can be seen along the way. But still, I was reminded by the glint of the T-logos all around me on the freeway that I was in Tesla country. I came across at least a dozen Model S drivers, and at one point, several of us were lined up in a queue, as if in formation. There’s even a Supercharger station in Monterey, which, with 315 miles of range, I was able to reach, without stopping, to charge along the way.

It may seem as if the Model 3 hype has stolen away the sheen from its more substantial sports sedan, the original symbol of Tesla grandeur. While the Model 3 earns the title of Car the Summer, it’s splashy debut helped nudge the Model S past a tipping point. After five years on the road, in many markets, the S is no longer an eccentric outlier, but instead it’s the luxury standard-bearer, and the obvious car that you see flying by you near wealthy California enclaves. As of the most recent quarter, Tesla has sold 22,026 Model S vehicles this year.

Sure, the Tesla P100D customer who can spend $162,000 (the sticker price on the model I tested) can likely also afford another luxury car or two, but it’s hard to match the cache and head nods one earns while driving this thing. When it comes to the S exterior design, only slight sculptural changes have been made to the front fascia since it debuted in the 2012 model year. Its understated form is ubiquitous.

The S is no longer an eccentric outlier

As Elon Musk pointed out at the Model 3 reveal, the S is still the more desirable car, and the P100D is the top performance dog in its S range. After driving both the 3 and Model S P100D, even for a short time, there’s really no direct performance comparison. We’ve already broken down the differences between the Model S and the Model 3; while Model 3 has early adopter cache, the Model P100D is in another class. It is the ultimate statement car of the moment, more than car makes that come with a higher price tag like Ferrari, Porsche, or McLaren: I’m wealthy. I am forward thinking. And now, get outta my way.

Part of its appeal is that Tesla is playing the numbers game. Though P100D debuted a year ago, we’re still talking about its jaw-dropping statistics. A few weeks before I drove this model, as a sideshow during the Tesla Model 3 handover, a Tesla employee demoed Ludicrous Plus mode for me, illuminating Easter egg moments and all. This push of a button earns Tesla the industry best 0–60 mile per hour time of 2.4 seconds, and the stomach-dropping delight / panic it creates (depending on the passenger) to brunt intensity. The closest comparison I can conjure is the memory of a delirious Formula One three-seater at track in France. But unlike most cars capable of dizzying speeds, it has more practical qualities.

Sure the Tesla is fun to stunt in, but sometimes a mid to full-size sedan can feel cumbersome to handle on more meandering roads. But the Model S really never feels like too much car. It has a 116.5-inch wheelbase, and is 196 inches long (equivalent to the BMW 5 Series), but it handles its girth with grace on winding stretches of pastoral roads. Its design language doesn’t blare supercar, so it doesn’t feel weird or ostentatious to pull into a diner parking lot.

The biggest problem of driving this Model S: keeping speed in a sensible range. It’s easy to fly. This is one reason to engage AutoPilot’s Traffic Aware Cruise Control as a way to hold back on temptation, capping off highway speeds at 90 miles per hour.

I experimented with the newest update of the second-generation AutoPilot, powered by a version of Nvidia's Drive PX2, in spurts throughout the drive. Though the car now has eight cameras as part of its plan to reach full self-driving capabilities, it is only using four. The cameras add 360-degree visibility and 820 feet of sight. When the icon, which resembles a blue alien, appears signaling access to AutoPilot functions, I squeezed the lever next to the steering wheel to engage AutoSteer. As it tracked the lane, it lacked the fluidity of the natural body movements of hand to wheel in its efforts to navigate the road. But I never felt as if I was in a precarious position when it was engaged.

On the more beautiful stretches of road, I switched back to the more satisfying sensation of driving. I treated AutoPilot as the passenger who might hold the wheel when I was slightly distracted, rather than as the student driver who is being tested for proficiency. I did allow it to guide me toward my exit, but I wasn’t ready to give up control and put all the system’s capabilities to the test. Test-driving a press car on unfamiliar public roads is no time to discover my inner stunt driver. I remembered the strict warning about using AutoPilot in beta: at my own risk.

Had I lived with this vehicle for a bit longer, I would have tried out its other abilities: such as merging onto another highway and self-parking. But when I longed to use AutoPilot most — during headache-inducing Silicon Valley commuter traffic on the 280 — it wasn’t accessible. Tesla isn’t ready to let drivers zone out in rush hour just yet.

In some ways, what makes the S appealing is its versatility. Its spaciousness makes it well-suited toward weekend getaways, and what makes it feel like a larger car. My small carry-on bag was swallowed by the ample trunk space in the rear, and I still had the front trunk at my disposal. It’s ideal for the traveler who doesn’t travel light.

The car I drove on my Pebble Beach journey came off the Fremont, California, assembly line in June. It had a base price of $140,000, and was souped up with another $22,000 of features. Those upgrades included the $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot, a $3,300 white interior, and $4,500 for 21-inch gray wheels. It also had an all-glass panoramic roof for $2,000, a subzero package priced at $1,000, and was capped off by the $3,500 premium upgrades package like a battery range upgrade, red brake calipers, and my favorite nifty feature: Bio-Weapon Defense Mode, which is an air-filtration system salve for allergy-sufferers like me, who are often sneezing at the wheel. All these creature comforts, paired with the extended range of the P100D, worked to make the ideal road trip candidate.

My primary interactions with the screens were for navigating unfamiliar roads, where charging stations are clearly marked. As my colleague Lauren Goode wrote, the displays are easy to interpret, there are no complicated dials or gauges, and the speedometer is in big, bold numerals. One observation: using the map on the screen’s considerable space felt like the digital version of a road book map splayed across the dash.

Even after five years, it’s too early to say if the Model S will have the staying power of a design like the Porsche 911, a classic which has never really felt out of date. Will we see the same basic Tesla form on the road in 50 years, or are we near the peak of the Model S era? As Tesla works to provide all of its vehicles with full self-driving capabilities, it doesn’t seem to be planning for obsolescence.

A few months ago, several auto industry leaders said the industry is watching Tesla and talking to its customers. “We have great respect for what Tesla has done,” Porsche president and CEO Klaus Zellmer said in an interview. “They provided technology that people didn’t believe in a luxury segment in a high price point, but they are still not making any money. I can understand why there is this hype about Tesla.”

The staying power of the high-end Model S in its current iteration may soon be tested by a number of new electric luxury models by Lucid, Karma, and Fisker. All-electric cars like the Aston Martin Rapide are coming soon and most recently the Mercedes-Maybach electric convertible concept was unveiled ahead of the Frankfurt Motor Show.

Until Model 3 cars reach actual customers, Tesla remains a luxury car company, and a maker of a bold sports sedan and a space-aged luxury crossover. The success of the Model 3, and its ability to make good on money spent, will play a large part in this future. Tesla claimed it will produce 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2017, and 10,000 per week by the end of 2018. But it’s about more than its electric powertrain that gives Tesla an edge in the small electric car market. It’s the pivot to AutoPilot and industry firsts, like over-the-air-updates attributed to Elon Musk’s ambitious vision that set it apart. The outside might not change, but Tesla serves a new kind of gearhead: one who’s interested in software, radar, and sensors.

And that’s why, at least for today, the Model S P100D retains its status as the car of choice for California cool, where superchargers never seem to be too far. Living with the P100D every day isn’t about the psychosomatic abilities to break record speeds or to let the car drive. The whole point of a car like this is knowing that, as the car updates, your car will do more.

Tesla remains a luxury car company

A few days after I returned from Monterey Car Week, I watched Disconnected. At one point in Shawn’s drive, it looks like the jig is up when he parks at a hotel in order to charge and the hotel manager finds him sleeping there in the morning: “You unplug your spaceship and get off my lot, and I’ll consider not calling the cops” In the end, if not a feel-good film, it’s a feel-better film, and his fate is never really in question. The Tesla stays pristine, making the ride home a smooth journey, with Shawn’s scientist dad at the wheel, back in charge.

Tesla lost a record $671 million om the quarter, the company reported Wednesday, and produced just 260 units of the Model 3 over those three months from July to September.

The company has lost nearly a quarter of its total market value since mid-September. Some analysts say they aren’t getting clear answers from CEO Elon Musk and they’re less inclined to believe Tesla promises, for instance that production of 5,000 Model 3s per week this quarter can now be expected in the first quarter of 2018. Tesla admits there are problems at its battery factory; others wonder if there are issues on the main production line.

Promises and Restated Promises

The $35,000 (base price) Tesla Model 3 sedan is Tesla’s mass market car. Some 400,000 people put down $1,000 deposits.

Tesla’s goal was to be producing Model 3s in significant quantity this year. In July, Musk tweeted Tesla expected to build more than 1,500 Model 3s in August and September and in an August newsletter to shareholders, Tesla reiterated, “We are confident we can produce just over 1,500 vehicles in Q3.” Tesla met 17 percent of that goal, shipping just 260. A chart still on Tesla’s site today (Nov. 3) showed the 5,000 units-per-week production by year’s end. The August letter also said Tesla will be “increasing Model 3 production to 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.”

Some analysts say they don’t see Tesla hitting 5,000 cars per week until sometime in Q2 (April to June 2018). That calls into question Tesla’s goal of building nearly 300,000 Model 3’s in 2018; it could be more like 250,000.

It’s the Production Line, Not the Car

The Tesla Model S, its luxury sedan, suffered from reliability issues in its early years. Consumer Reports expects the 2018 Model S will be better than average; 2016 and 2017 models were rated average. The Model X crossover/wagon has been plagued with problems on its falcon-wing doors. Buyers of both have complained about long waits for crash repair parts. Tesla has been talking about strong sales of the Models S and X, but it has also cut production, causing confusion about how well the cars are doing.

As for the Model 3, Tesla says the delay results from problems at the battery production Gigafactory in Nevada, which is a joint venture with Panasonic. Musk actually did his conference call with analysts from the factory and said he’d been sleeping there as well, recently. “To date, our primary production constraint has been in the battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1, where cells are packaged into modules,” Tesla said. Four of the battery cell modules make up the battery pack.

Some analysts question whether there may also be issues with the main Tesla factory–the production line in Fremont, California–that could also be a bottleneck if and when the battery issues are straightened out. A production line is a delicate ballet of just-in-time deliveries, moving parts to the line, welding machines, robotic arms, and humans putting it all together. Tesla last month fired several hundred employees on account of, Tesla says, poor performance reviews. (Some of the employees disputed the performance-review part.) Just before taking analyst questions Wednesday, Musk went on an extended riff or rant, take your pick, about journalists lacking integrity. According to a transcription provided by Seeking Alpha, Musk said:

The other thing I want to mention, there are a lot of articles about Tesla firing employees and layoffs, these are really ridiculous. And any journalist who has written articles to this effect should be ashamed of themselves for lack of journalistic integrity. Every company in the world, there’s annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, despite Tesla having an extremely high standard, a standard far higher than other car companies, which we need to have in order to survive against much larger car companies; you can’t be a little guy and have equal levels of skill as the big guy.

Meanwhile, other automakers are improving quality every year, including on US-built vehicles. As the Tesla Model 3 trickles out, Chevrolet continues to crank out the Bolt EV–a record 2,781 units in October, 17,083 for the year and along with sales last December, 17,662 so far in Bolt’s history. That’s not much compared with Tesla’s Model 3 plans, but it dwarfs the couple thousand Model 3s Tesla will ship this year.

The Bolt EV is comparable in range to the base Model 3, 238 miles (rated), and a bit smaller. Reviewers are split between calling the Bolt EV plain and those seeing it as utilitarian-sort-of-cute. It is currently the only significant challenger in 2018 to the Model S in terms of range. The 2018 Nissan Leaf gets a battery upgrade, but only to 150 miles; a redesigned Leaf should hit 200-plus in 2019, as should other automakers. In fact, virtually every automaker will have a 200-mile EV by 2020. Tesla’s window of exclusivity may be closing.

Keep the Faith

Tesla’s Musk said there have been very few people stepping back from the waiting line and asking for their $1,000 deposits back. That makes sense. Having $1,000 tied up isn’t a severe hardship in this portion of the market and Tesla the company has been able to bond with many of its buyers and want-to-be buyers.

How investors and their advisors feel is another matter. It has been a rocky summer and early fall. Tesla has had tough periods that led to even higher valuations for those who stayed ab0ard. Tesla went public June 29, 2010 at $17 per share, hit $100 in May 2013, $200 in May 2014, and $300 in April 2017. Shares peaked at an all-time of $389.61 Sept. 17, 2017, fell to $321.08 the day before the earnings report, then closed at $299.26 Thursday and was likely to end the week around $300, clawing back six-plus months of gains.

Even if Tesla buyers believe Elon Musk has a magical touch and they keep the faith, it appears the analysts covering Tesla may not continue to be as deferential. Some are talking about a coming cash crunch. Some in their reports to clients talked about wishing for more transparency from Tesla and its executives. And some may be put off by Musk’s riffs on allegedly low-integrity journalists trying to make Tesla look bad.

Shania Twain could almost be singing to Tesla’s maestro: Okay, so you’ve got a car | That don’t impress me much | So you got the moves but have you got the touch?"

Before Joining The Post In + He Was A Features Writer At The Houston Chronicle + A Crime Reporter At The San Antonio Express-News.,"In Dante’s “Inferno,” part of his 14th century epic poem, Hell is portrayed as nine concentric circles of torment, each with its own nightmarish form of suffering.

The allegory is a reflection of Renaissance-era morality, but surprisingly it’s also an apt metaphor for building the most sought-after electric car in the world from scratch.

During a call with investors earlier this week, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk made that much clear as he laid out the challenges plaguing the nearly stalled production of the Model 3, the company’s first mass-market vehicle.

“Let’s say Level 9 is the worst,” Musk said. “We were in Level 9, now we’re in Level 8, and I think we’re close to exiting Level 8. I thought we’d probably be more like in Level 7 by now.”

“And I have to tell you, I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago when I realized we were in Level 9,” he added. “Then we got to Level 8, and now I can see a clear path to sunshine.”



[Tesla reports big loss as Model 3 production struggles continue]

The particularities of the company’s challenge — many of them engineering problems involving robots and battery packs at Tesla’s sprawling Gigafactory 1 in Nevada — may have been unforeseen, but the arduous journey into the metaphorical underworld certainly wasn’t. Minutes after Musk took the stage to introduce the Model 3 at Tesla’s factory headquarters in July, he began warning of the incoming “production hell” a period that would test Tesla, the company’s employees and their leader like never before.

Three months later, Tesla is mired in what is probably the hardest portion of that test, and it’s beginning to show. Minutes after the company reported a loss of $671.1 million for the third quarter, Wednesday, Musk’s voice sounded monotone, dispassionate and a more than a tinge irritable. The company hoped to produce 1,500 Model 3s during that period, but managed only 260. At the moment, however, Musk was concerned with something else. He spent the first part of the call admonishing journalists for suggesting that recent layoffs were linked to production issues, punctuating his uncharacteristic rant about journalistic integrity with a single word: “Shame!”

Musk said a cold was to blame for his catatonic voice, but one couldn’t help but wonder whether the culprit was actually general fatigue. Based on Musk’s own description of the urgency surrounding the Model 3 rollout, it’s not a stretch of the imagination. To resolve nagging production issues, Musk told investors, he’s “reallocated” some of the company’s top engineers to Nevada, where he and his team are working seven days a week.

Musk said he’s there alongside them because he believes in leading “from the front lines.” Amid the pressure, he’s documented his sanity-stabilizing downtime on Instagram, in fact.

“I’ve personally been here on the Zone 2 module line at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning trying to diagnose robot calibration issues,” he said. “I’m doing everything I can.”

“We got it covered,” he added. “It’s just going to take us a few months longer than we expected.”

How long exactly?

It’s “difficult to predict” Musk acknowledged, pointing out that he’s now trying to avoid making production pronouncements that the rest of the world endlessly dissects.

The problems are so complicated that company officials — deeply versed in the company’s automated details — struggle to explain them succinctly, in non-engineering terms. Building a Model 3 involves thousands of processes, they say, noting that the car has 10,000 unique parts. Though the Model 3’s design on the whole is much easier to build than Tesla’s other models, they say, parts of that process are “intensely automated.” The upside of that means that the car’s automated assembly line is shorter and more streamlined than most. The downside (at this stage, anyway) is that the system “is designed as a very tightly integrated” fashion, according to Musk, meaning that when one element of that manufacturing process is broken, the ripple effects are profound.

Either the machine works, Musk said, or it doesn’t. Complicating matters was a subcontractor that failed miserably, he noted, forcing Tesla to rewrite a huge amount of the software from scratch. Minutes later, he blamed Tesla for failing to notice the failure, an oversight that still appears to pain him.

“We dropped the ball,” Musk said, “and did not realize what was dropped until quite recently.”

The timeline and the numbers remain fluid, but here’s the latest: Musk said he expects Tesla to produce 5,000 Model 3s per week by “sometime in March.”

Musk had previously said that the company would reach the same production rate by the end of 2017.

With the company’s profitability firmly staked in the Model 3’s liftoff, those expectations remain exceedingly high and pressure-filled, even if automotive analysts are right about prospective Tesla buyers being more patient and flexible than the typical car buyer. Ironically, the man who has made a habit out of warning the world about the perils of an artificially intelligent future, is already living in a robotic nightmare. The only way out, he maintains, is to keep going.

He’s come this far, after all.

“For the skeptics out there, I’d like to ask them, ‘Which one of you would’ve predicted that Tesla would go from 25,900 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now?” Musk said, concealing all but a trace of the retributive fury you’d expect to find in a brilliant billionaire. “I suspect the answer is zero.”

Tesla is trying to convince the trucking community it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks. This is the largest public order of the big rig so far, Tesla said.

Tesla unveiled its semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.

The Tesla trucks will cost around $200,000 each for a total order of about $25 million. UPS expects the semi-trucks, the big rigs that haul freight along America’s highways, will have a lower total cost of ownership than conventional vehicles, which run at about $120,000.

Tesla has received pre-orders from such major companies as Walmart (WMT.N), fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc (JBHT.O) and food service distributor Sysco Corp (SYY.N)

Prior to UPS, the largest single pre-order came from PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, for 100 trucks.

UPS said it has provided Tesla with data on how its trucks function on their real-world routes in order to evaluate how the vehicle should perform in its fleet.

“As with any introductory technology for our fleet, we want to make sure it’s in a position to succeed,” Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters.

Phillippi said the 125 trucks will allow UPS to conduct a proper test of their abilities. He said the company was still determining their routes, but the semis will “primarily be in the United States.” Tesla will provide consultation and support on charging infrastructure.

“We have high expectations and are very optimistic that this will be a good product and it will have firm support from Tesla to make it work,” Phillippi said.

The UPS alternative fuel fleet already includes trucks propelled by electricity, natural gas, propane and other non-traditional fuels.

About 260,000 semis, or heavy-duty Class-8 trucks, are produced in North America annually, according to FTR, an industry economics research firm.

Including the UPS order, Tesla has at least 410 pre-orders in hand, according to a Reuters tally.

Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) and Volkswagen AG VOWG-P.DE hope to launch a smaller, electric medium-duty truck by late 2019, while rival Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) has delivered the first of a smaller range of electric trucks to customers in New York.

Here’s what to know about Tesla’s new vehicles: the Tesla Semi and the refreshed Tesla Roadster.

The Tesla Semi

Tesla Semi Tesla

The Tesla Semi is a battery-powered truck with an advertised range of 500 miles on a single charge when fully loaded and driving 65 miles per hour. It will include Tesla’s semiautonomous self-driving capabilities, which allow Tesla’s vehicles to drive themselves with minimal human input in some scenarios. Tesla did not specify how much the Tesla Semi will cost, but reservations begin at $5,000 per truck. Production is expected to start in 2019.

The Tesla Semi represents a major extension of the company’s business model. Whereas Tesla has previously focused on selling consumer vehicles, the Tesla Semi marks the firm’s first major foray into the commercial vehicle market.

While that market presents a potentially lucrative opportunity for Tesla, it also brings new challenges. Tesla has been known to over-promise and under-deliver on production deadlines and other targets (the new Model 3 sedan, for instance, has been plagued by production problems and delays.) While the company’s car fans might begrudgingly tolerate delays, commercial trucking companies are likely to be less forgiving of any snafus.

The Tesla Roadster

Tesla Roadster Tesla

Tesla and Musk had been teasing the Tesla Semi for months, leaving few surprises for Thursday’s big rig reveal. But Musk managed to surprise the automotive world nonetheless with the introduction of a refreshed Roadster supercar, Tesla’s original electric vehicle.

The new Roadster shares few similarities with the original, beyond the name. Whereas the first Roadster had the feel of a Skunkworks project (it was based on the Lotus Elise), the new model appears to be the collective expression of everything Tesla has learned about making vehicles in the past decade or so.

Tesla claims the new Roadster, which will start at $200,000, will do 0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds, have a top speed of 250 miles per hour, and will be able to drive up to 620 miles on a single charge. How those figures stand up to real-world testing remain to be seen. The range, in particular, will likely depend on how hard it’s driven. The Tesla Roadster won’t be available until 2020, Tesla says, but reservations start immediately for a cool $50,000 down.

A Tesla Model S P100D has just been used to set a new record for distance driven on a single charge: 901.2 km (~560 miles). Steven Peeters and Joeri Cools managed to break the record for the lowest energy consumption for the vehicle as well, achieving 88 Wh/km (54.7 Wh/mile).

They did so by hypermiling (driving the vehicle with the specific goal of increasing efficiency). For example, because cars are not as efficient at high speeds, the drivers averaged only 40 km/h (24 mph) — a speed that wouldn’t be ideal for actual travel, but that’s great for breaking records.

Most previous approaches to hypermiling have focused on driving cars in a straight line, but Peeters and Cools opted for a different approach, following a 26 km (~16 mile) closed loop in Belgium in order to learn to optimize the car’s energy usage.

“By the time we finished the attempt, we knew perfectly how to take every turn and roundabout to make sure we drove with the least possible consumption,” Peeters explained in a blog post. They also learned how to drive under different temperature conditions as the attempt took them almost an entire day: 23 hours and 45 minutes.

In 2015, Elon Musk predicted that a Tesla with a 950 km+ (~600 mile) maximum range would be ready by 2017. This attempt was just shy of the prediction, but the drivers think they did the best they could under their circumstances and explained what would be necessary to break the 1,000 km (~621 miles) record: “That would have to be a perfect run in perfect circumstances, which I believe are not possible in our country.”

A Precedent for Electric Cars

Hypermiling is not the way the vast majority of people drive, but it is a good test to show just how efficient a car can be. We must also consider that this test was undertaken in the error-strewn landscape of human judgement. If the Model S’s Autopilot were adjusted to maximize efficiency, it could potentially learn more quickly than the drivers and make the appropriate adjustments.

The previous Tesla record holder, Casey Spencer, achieved an 885 km (550 mile) run last year, so this record-breaking run marks an impressive new milestone for the Model S’s efficiency.

While these scores are not particularly close to beating the records set by non-electric vehicles, we must remember that this is only the second Tesla car ever built (with the Model 3 coming soon), updates are arriving quickly, and a lower maximum milage is a happy sacrifice for a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation.

If Tesla’s cars continue progressing at this rate, it won’t be long before their environmentally unfriendly counterparts are matched in performance — the only category they’re really ahead in anymore. Electric cars are now closing in fast on their fossil fuel-powered counterparts, with other recent feats including a Nio EP9 achieving a staggering time of 6:45:9 around Germany’s Nürburgring track. Soon, they’ll be ready for full industry domination."

At the same event, the billionaire also unwrapped a hotly-anticipated truck called the Tesla Semi.

Two launches at one event. It might not sound so ambitious. After all, many car manufacturers bring out numerous models at the same time.

But Tesla unveiled the new vehicles even as the Model 3 continues to have production issues. Earlier this year, Musk said that the company would be in ""manufacturing hell,"" and that's exactly what it has turned in to. In the last quarter, Tesla produced just 222 of its $35,000 mass market Model 3 cars, after expecting to make 1,500 during the period.

There are currently a lot of unhappy customers. On top of that, Tesla is spending around $1 billion a quarter, with the money mainly going towards setting up the Model 3 factory.

The Roadster and Semi definitely distracted from the Model 3 issues, but it could prove to be a major car crash for Tesla in the long run.

Musk could be putting too much on his plate, what with the two new models, resolving Model 3 problems, and running SpaceX and The Boring Company.

If Tesla is already spending $1 billion a quarter getting the Model 3 up and running, imagine how much money will need to be spent to get the two new vehicles off the ground. Tesla is already taking $50,000 deposits for the Roadster, which is set to be released in 2020, and is asking people to pay a $250,000 upfront for the special Founders Series Roadsters.

This could give Tesla some money in the short-term to help out with capital expenditure.

But, no doubt, Tesla will likely have to tap the markets again for some more money to build these future products. Musk has done a phenomenal job in convincing investors to play along, promising grand visions of the future, where Tesla leads the way. And its fans are potentially more loyal than Apple's. It's admirable for sure.

However, his current plans are going to rely heavily on his vision to placate those investors. Musk promised to ""blow your mind"" with his latest event, but not all in the market were convinced. Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a note last week that the reveal ""raised more questions than answers.""

Tesla could no doubt be a major success story in its quest to accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy, and it's already laid the groundwork to become a leader in driverless cars. The long-term potential looks good.

But if Musk can't fix the current problems, and tries to go big too fast, he might end up alienating investors fed up with production delays and unkept promises. Tesla is going to require the market to raise capital and to do that, Musk will need two hands on the wheel during the years ahead."

Regardless of where one stands on the topic of electric cars, it’s difficult to argue that Tesla Motors hasn’t disrupted the automotive industry. The Californian company is no longer written off as simply a startup with a dim future; its unique breed of fast, luxurious electric vehicles has gotten the attention of product planners from virtually every major automaker.

This is how it all began.

A simple mission statement

Named after inventor Nikola Tesla, Tesla Motors was founded in July of 2003 by Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Elon Musk, and JB Straubel. Musk was appointed Chairman of the Board after helping Tesla raise $7.5 million during its first financing round in February of 2004. A year later, he led another financing round which raised $13 million. With a name and money in the bank, Tesla set out to develop its very first car.

“When someone buys the Tesla Roadster, they are actually helping pay for the development of the low-cost family car.”

Early on, Musk made it clear he was funding Tesla to help wean motorists off of fossil fuels by bringing electric mobility to the masses. His so-called master plan called for the launch of a relatively expensive, high-profile electric car to demonstrate what the company is capable of. Tesla would then use the proceeds from the sports car to build a more affordable car, and use those proceeds to move further down-market. The plan has been posted on Tesla’s official website since 2006.

“In keeping with a fast-growing technology company, all free cash flow is plowed back into R&D to drive down the costs and bring the following products to market as fast as possible. When someone buys the Tesla Roadster sports car, they are actually helping pay for the development of the low-cost family car,” Musk wrote a decade ago.

Developing a sports car from scratch was too costly for the upstart automaker, so it looked for a company willing to provide a chassis and a body. On July 11, 2005, English car maker Lotus agreed to sell Tesla bare Elise shells. The Tesla Roadster was then born.

Walking the walk

Tesla introduced its very first model on July 19, 2006, at a private event at the Santa Monica airport in California. The first batch of 100 cars was spoken for in less than a month, but the project faced several setbacks early on and production was delayed several times.

A third financing round raised $40 million in 2007. Musk was again one of Tesla’s biggest investors; the Paypal co-founder has invested hundreds of millions of from his own personal fortune into the company. He became Tesla’s top executive when he replaced Ze’ev Drori – who was at the helm for less than a year – in 2008.

Early adopters liked the idea of an electric sports car with instant torque. In its most powerful configuration, the Roadster offered 288 horsepower, 280 pound-feet of torque, and it could hit 60 mph from a standstill in 3.7 seconds, a figure that allowed it to embarrass some of the most exclusive machines on the planet. Better yet, it offered 245 miles of range without the use of a gasoline-powered range extender. The Roadster cost $109,000 before federal and local government incentives were factored in.

In 2008, rumors broke out that Tesla was busily working on a second, more family-oriented model named Model S. Reports claimed the Model S would ride on a brand-new platform, not one borrowed from another automaker, and that much was true. However, many believed it would use an on-board, gasoline-burning range extender like the Chevrolet Volt, the ill-fated Fisker Karma, and certain variants of the BMW i3. Of course, those rumors were completely false.

Tesla confirmed the rumblings a short while later when it presented a close-to-production concept that previewed the Model S. While the Roadster was visibly Lotus-based, the company’s new concept stood out with a head-turning design and a sleek, coupe-like roof line. Many motorists put a deposit down on the car before the final production version was unveiled, a phenomenon that would later become par for the course for the automaker.

Still, all was not well under the surface. In October of 2008, Tesla insiders claimed the company had just $9 million left in the bank, a very small amount for an automaker in full expansion. Many questioned the company’s long-term survival.

Shaky startup no more

Tesla’s first step towards profitability came in 2009 when it announced it had struck a deal to sell 1,000 battery packs to Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler. At the time, executives explained they wanted to build an electric version of the Smart Fortwo to gather data on electric vehicles. The one-time deal burgeoned into a full-fledged alliance when Daimler bought a 10-percent stake in Tesla in May of 2009 for the sum of $50 million.

Tesla became the first American car company to go public since Ford held its IPO in 1956.

In January of 2010, Tesla proudly announced a sizable $465 million loan from the United States Department of Energy (DOT). At the time, Musk affirmed the money would help his company build two production facilities in California. However, the executive changed his mind and purchased Toyota’s shuttered New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) plant in Fremont, California, several months later.

Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla, allegedly after chief executive Akio Toyoda took a spin in Musk’s personal Roadster. The media speculated the Japanese brand would get its own version of the Model S in exchange for the considerable investment. These rumors never materialized, though Tesla provided drivetrain components for the all-electric version of the last-generation RAV4.

In June of 2010, Tesla became the first American car company to go public since Ford held its initial public offering (IPO) in 1956. Trading began at $17 a share and closed at $23.89, representing a 40.5-percent jump in its first full day of trading. Tesla raised $226 million by going public, considerably more than the $185 million executives were hoping to secure.

Building a multi-vehicle lineup

The Model X was unveiled in concept form in February of 2012, and Tesla received $40 million in orders in less than a week. Traffic to the company’s website increased 2,800 percent the night the X was unveiled, while “Model X” became the third-most searched term on Google. At the time, Musk expected the X would hit the market in late 2013.

Production of the Roadster ended in 2012 after over 2,400 examples were built, and the first Model S was delivered in June of that year. It was unlike anything else on the road: luxurious, spacious, entirely electric, and faster than a Porsche 911. Tesla had gone from an ambitious upstart to a force to be reckoned with by showing its capacity to build a desirable, volume-oriented sedan.

Tesla quieted the skeptics who lamented the lack of an infrastructure to charge electric cars by building the first of over 200 Supercharger stations. And, it re-affirmed its commitment to bypass traditional dealers and sell cars directly to customers, a decision that it has defended in court time and again.

The DOT loan was paid off in full in 2013, nine years ahead of schedule. That same year, Musk used his personal Twitter account to recruit engineers capable of developing semi-autonomous technology. The executive also clarified his company wishes to develop the tech in-house, which ended long-standing rumors of a collaboration with Google.

The development process went much faster than expected: Production of Autopilot-ready cars began in November of 2014, and the software was enabled in October of the following year. Using state-of-the-art tech, Autopilot gave the car the ability to analyze the area directly in front of it. Long-range radars and a 360-degree ultrasonic sonar complemented the on-board camera, making it possible to identify both hard and soft objects ahead of and around the car.

The P85D model was capable of hitting 60 mph from a stop in 3.2 seconds.

With Autopilot engaged, the Model S was capable of changing lanes when the driver activates the turn signal and read speed limit signs. Other functions – including blind spot warning, emergency braking, and, more recently, a function that allows the car to semi-autonomously navigate freeway off-ramps – have been added since.

Tesla announced plans to open a new assembly plant named Gigafactory located outside of Reno, Nevada. Construction work kicked off in 2014, and production began in 2016. Tesla and partner Panasonic predict the facility will ultimately build lithium-ion battery packs for half a million electric vehicles annually.

Daimler sold its stake in Tesla in late 2014, though the company continued to supply Mercedes with battery packs for the B-Class Electric Drive. Toyota sold a majority of its shares in Tesla at about the same time.

A new, D-badged variant of the Model S was introduced in January of 2015 with dual-motor all-wheel drive. The P85D model was capable of hitting 60 mph from a stop in 3.2 seconds, blasting past high-performance machines built by big-name brands like AMG and BMW M. Performance was turned up yet another notch with the release of an over-the-air software update that added an “insane” acceleration mode. If that wasn’t enough, the Ludicrous mode that appeared shortly after lowered the car’s 0 to 60 time to 2.8 seconds.

The Model X was finally introduced in late September of 2015. Fine-tuning it was easier said than done, but the production model managed to retain the radical falcon doors that characterized the concept. Like the Model S, the X was offered with dual-motor all-wheel drive and a Ludicrous mode.

The Model 3 that Tesla promised a few years ago was previewed on March 31, 2016. What was shown during the launch event was still a prototype, but it gave motorists a good idea of what to expect from the most affordable Tesla yet. Notably, it will cost $35,000 before options and incentives are factored in, it will be ready for semi-autonomous driving, and it will boast up to 250 miles of range. Production isn’t scheduled to start until 2017, which hasn’t stopped nearly 400,000 motorists from all over the globe from making a deposit on the car.

April of 2016 brought a facelifted Model S with a new front end that fell in line with the design language introduced by the Model X. A range-topping version of the Model S named P100D was added to the lineup in November. It was capable of hitting 60 mph from a stop in 2.5 seconds, a figure that cemented its spot as one of the fastest street-legal cars ever built. New advances in battery technology gave it 315 miles of range.

Tesla has also branched out into other segments of the energy market. It unveiled the Powerwall – essentially a battery pack designed for home use – in April of 2014, and it bought sister company Solar City in 2016. That means buyers can install solar panels on the roof of their house, channel the energy to the Powerwall pack, and use the electricity to top up their Tesla. The vertical integration makes us that much closer to being free from foreign oil and, in places with enough sun, the utility company."
https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-is-not-the-next-apple-2017-5,pos,1.0,5.412935519704269e-25,Here's why Tesla is not the next Apple,2017-05-05 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:46.969793,Matthew Debord,"The Tesla Model 3. YouTube/Motor Trend ""Tesla's cars are effectively consumer electronics, albeit expensive ones, that reduce our dependence on oil.""

That's a big summarizing statement from the case made by Loup Venture's Gene Munster, Doug Clinton and Andrew Murphy that Tesla, with a $50-billion current market cap, is destined to become the next Apple (market cap: $770 billion.)

Munster was a noted Apple analyst when he was ensconced at Piper Jaffray, and he's now out on his own with a venture fund. Thematically, he's looking for another Apple, and Tesla is clearly it.

Tesla combines all the elements that Apple enthusiasts love to tout about the tech giant: visionary leader (Elon Musk and Steve Jobs), cultlike following, sexy products, a walled-garden approach the user experience. It has for some time, and certainly since Jobs' death, been extremely tempting to slot Musk into a role as the next Steve, and to promote Tesla as the latest high-tech, big-growth company.

Conveniently overlooked in this analysis is Tesla's inability to make money; its difficulties achieving its production and deliveries targets; the meager global market for electric vehicles; and most critically the fact that Tesla is effectively not a consumer electronics company, but rather an auto manufacturer.

Not a tech company

This distinction between Tesla-the-carmaker and Tesla-the-Silicon-Valley-tech darling is nothing new. It's actually becoming progressively more evident as Tesla produces more vehicles and heads toward the introduction of its mass-market Model 3 later this year.

But Munster and his colleagues can't resist the Apple-Tesla analogy, no matter how tenuous it is. To support their case, they offer five key similarities between the companies: brand; visionary leadership; integrated hardware and software; halo effect; reshaping a market.

Munster believes that Tesla's high-satisfaction rate thus far among owners means that Tesla matches Apple on that brand-love front. But with Apple, we're talking about a huge chunk of the market just for iPhones (beyond Apple's other products); with Tesla, we're dealing with a sliver of car owners.

Much smaller and cheaper than a Tesla. Getty

Musk is certainly a visionary leader. In fact, he's much more visionary than Jobs. And that could be a problem — Jobs wasn't out to save the Earth or colonize Mars. His driving ambition was basically to make people happy.

As far as integrated hardware and software goes, Munster thinks that because Tesla does just about everything itself, it has ""a multi-year head start over other automakers in terms of features like over-the-air updates and autonomous driving.""

But that's bogus because most other major automakers could commence OTR updates tomorrow if they wanted, but they're unsure if it makes sense for consumers. In terms of autonomous driving, Tesla has been running its system for several years, but the owner base is still tiny, and the technology is distinctive, favoring cameras and sensors rather than more expensive laser-radar tech.

As a result, it's entirely possible that Tesla's tech could top out and be quickly surpassed by a GM or a Ford. Besides, although software is a key piece of every Tesla vehicle, it isn't Tesla's core product: a metal rectangle with four wheels, a battery, and one or two electric motors.

Tesla is headed in the wrong direction

What about ""halo effect?"" The argument is that ""[w]ith the Model 3 starting at $35,000, a large audience of entry level luxury car owners are going to experience Tesla for the first time, and at 91% satisfaction, they will likely be happy to join the club.""

First off, it's unsure whether they'll be 91% satisfied with a much cheaper Tesla — so far, the company has played in the higher reaches of the luxury realm.

Second, Tesla is about to undermine its quite attractive gross margins of around 20% (that's what it says it gets on the Model S and Model X, it two current vehicles). The Model 3 will be priced at roughly half as much (two-thirds as much if there's ever a barebones entry level car), so that gross margin won't hold if Tesla can't build the Model 3 for half as much as the S and X.

This is a common situation in the auto industry. Smaller, cheaper cars make less money than big trucks and SUVs. Thanks to Musk's vision of freeing humanity from fossil fuels, Tesla is willing to overlook this. The objective has to be getting as many electric cars on the road as possible.

Munster spins some more gold around Tesla's energy storage and solar business, both of which add effectively nothing to the company's valuation while distracting its management and adding debt to the balance sheet. The idea is that Tesla is a conglomerate that's creating a platform for sustainable energy.

What's fascinating and alarming here is Munster's — and for that matter, a lot of Tesla bulls' — fixation with talking about the company as anything but at base a carmaker.

This is obviously because it's awkward to justify a $50-billion valuation for a car company that can barely make 80,000 vehicles a year when its less valuable competitors — Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, at times GM — can make and profitably sell 80,000 of a single pickup truck model in a month.

History repeats itself

Wall Street went through something similar in 2015-2016, when analysts collectively figured out that Tesla needed to manufacture millions of vehicles to justify what was then considered a lofty $30-billion market cap. Tesla had been scrutinized as a stock, unhinged from manufacturing fundamentals (the biggest of which is that no major automaker is still vertically integrated, but instead uses ""just in time"" lean manufacturing methods). A more intense focus on its production and sales caused Wall Street to (sort of) see the light.

With the 15-year-old company adding $20 billion in stock value in just four months, a new set of fantastic justifications are required. Enter the revived notion that Tesla should be valued by tech metrics, rather than dragged down by the mundane blocking-and-tackling concerns that are successfully managed by every far less valuable global automaker.

What's impressive, really, is that Munster (and Clinton and Murphy) would even go there. It's understandable: there are Tesla bulls and there are folks who think that Tesla will change everything, not unlike how Apple altered the lives of many with the iPhone. But if you know anything about the car business, you'll realize that Munster's ""Tesla is the new Apple"" position is a good story that has almost no connection to reality.

No one's going to blame you for griping about wood trim that doesn't match, suspension components that rattle, air conditioning that doesn't work, a cracked windshield pillar, a car that unexpectedly shuts down, or the myriad other issues Tesla owners have reported.

The online forums where Tesla's famously zealous fans share videos of Autopilot feats and ludicrous acceleration feature a growing number of threads outlining complaints about the quality of the company's materials and workmanship. You can read about electrical gremlins, poor panel alignment, rattles, and other problems. ""My MX100D's alignment was off from the beginning,"" wrote Tesla Forums user jajabor, who says he owns a top-of-the-line Model X SUV. ""There was not a single body panel that didn't have any issues.""

Quality control problems pose a significant challenge as Elon Musk's company transitions from a boutique automaker to mass manufacturer and gears up to build the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. Musk wants Tesla, which built 83,992 cars last year, to crank out half a million next year. The Toyotas and GMs of the world move that many cars in a month, but it nevertheless represents a huge step up for the Silicon Valley upstart. Getting it wrong could be a huge problem not only for the company, but for electric vehicles in general.

Mo' Models, Mo' Problems

The company insists its record is comparable to that of any other automaker, and it considers reports of excessive complaints overblown. ""In the rare cases when a customer does have an issue, we take it very seriously, working closely with each owner to proactively address any problems with their vehicle,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. ""The anecdotal issues that sometimes make headlines aren’t based on data and aren’t dissimilar to issues experienced by all manufacturers, but there’s a greater level of interest in what we do.""

They raise a good point. Musk could generate headlines tweeting his grocery list, and Tesla recently saw its valuation surpass that of Ford and GM. ""There’s definitely a 'Tesla effect',"" says Wallace Hopp, an auto industry expert at the University of Michigan. ""It’s one of the most valuable car companies now, everything it does is going to get a lot of attention.""

Still, a litany of complaints, a lawsuit alleging its Autopilot feature is unsafe, and the recent recall of 53,000 cars with a parking brake problem make it easy for some to question whether Tesla can hit its growth targets while delivering on Musk's promise to build the finest automobiles on the road. Don't forget, Consumer Reports noted in October, 2015, that ""Tesla's reliability doesn't match its high performance"" even if the Models S P85D offered, at that time, the best performance ever recorded by the magazine. Consumer Reports cited problems with the drivetrain, power and charging equipment, and the dashboard touchscreen, plus assorted squeaks, rattles, and leaks.

To be fair, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalls thousands of cars each week for problems ranging from the mildly annoying to the potentially deadly, and the issue that prompted Tesla's voluntary recall is not that big a deal. Even a cursory search of any automotive forum reveals griping owners, so Tesla isn't unusual there, either. But Hopp, who owns a Model S, notes that his own car needed a new computer shortly after delivery.

""I do think that the build quality is not at world class levels yet,"" he says. ""I love it, it’s an engineering marvel, but it has screwy glitches.""

A New Kind of Car Company

Tesla moves quickly to remedy any problems customers report, and last year it poached Peter Hochholdinger, who ran production at Audi (a company with an enviable reputation for quality) to oversee production of the Model 3. But it’s tough to overcome the challenges that come with scaling up so quickly. Musk wants to increase production at the company’s Fremont, California, factory 495 percent by the end of 2018. He's got to, if he hopes to meet the 373,000 (and growing) preorders for the Model 3 in a timely manner.

Musk, perhaps the most ambitious man alive (what with the cars, the semis, the rockets, the solar panels, the AI, and the tunneling), reportedly shortened the traditional path to production by limiting the lengthy testing of beta models favored by the old-school automakers. That's not unusual—engineers across the industry use computer modeling to reduce prototyping. And in another innovation, the first Model 3 sedans off the line will go to Tesla and SpaceX employees who can shake out any problems.

It's worth noting, too, that Tesla designed the Model 3 with mass production in mind. Musk learned that lesson with the glorious but absurd ""falcon doors"" on the Model X that lift like wings. They look cool, but led to engineering headaches and production delays. And Tesla is now a proven manufacturer with the clout, and the resources, to work with the best suppliers in the business, which goes a long way toward preventing the sort of problems seen with the Model S.

You can't overstate the importance of getting this right, both for Tesla, and for electric vehicles in general.

A New Kind of Customer

Musk arguably has done more than anyone to make electric vehicles cool. Before the Roadster and Model S came along, people equated EVs with golf carts. Still, the people buying them have been early adopters willing to tolerate glitches and rattles and the occasional ""WTF?"" because they believe in the technology, the company, and the man leading it. That won't fly once Tesla starts moving cars in big numbers.

""When consumers buy a mass-market car priced around $35,000 that will be their primary mode of transportation, the degree of expectation will increase immensely,"" Kathleen Rizk, director of global automotive consulting at JD Power, said last month. “We’ve seen that with other well-liked brands, whether or not it involves an electric vehicle.”

Tesla doesn't need to follow the path of the old-school auto makers, but the Silicon Valley ethos of just build something, release it, and improve it through iteration and software updates, won't cut it either. Apple and Samsung may have bounced back from products that bent and burned, but automakers don't enjoy the same latitude. Just look at Fiat—the company is only now returning to the US, some 40 years after being driven out by cars so poorly screwed together that people joked the name meant ""Fix it again, Tony.""

This goes beyond Tesla to EVs in general because Musk wants the Model 3 to be the car that pushes electrics beyond Palo Alto and Manhattan to Peoria and Minneapolis in a way that cars like the Nissan Leaf so far haven't. A reputation for glitches and rattles could set the technology back. Just look at what happened with diesels in the 1970s.

Still, Musk steadfastly believes the future is electric, so he surely understands the stakes for his company and the technology it champions. None of this will be news to him, or to his team of engineers. And you can bet no one is more determined to get this right."

Both of those are going to be critical as Tesla, which reported its first-quarter earnings today, heads into the back half of the year. The company has gone to market multiple times to raise additional capital, and said year-to-date capital expenditures would be slightly over $2 billion by the time it started Model 3 production. With a lower price point, the Model 3 opens Tesla up to a wider market that could help it justify its ballooning valuation.

Tesla reported a loss of $1.33 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion, while Wall Street expected a loss of 83 cents per share on $2.61 billion in revenue. While it was a wider-than-expected loss, it looks like a pretty ho-hum result for the company as all eyes look toward the later part of the year when the Model 3 production is in full swing — and whether Tesla will be able to get enough cars rolling out.

In April, Tesla’s continued rising stock price valued the company more than Ford. That came on the heels of the company saying its vehicle production and deliveries rose in the first quarter at a rate faster than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Tesla were largely unchanged today, with the company worth more than $50 billion (still well above Ford).

[graphiq id=”cyCQbmRMzQN” title=”Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Price – Year to Date” width=”600″ height=”534″ url=”https://sw.graphiq.com/w/cyCQbmRMzQN” frozen=”true”]

In April, Musk gave a sort of teaser to a new semi-truck from Tesla. The company is also expected to reveal the final production version of the Model 3 in July. But the Model 3 is likely still going to be on the top of everyone’s minds, with a $35,000 price tag that’s targeting a market looking for a less expensive electric car. (Calling $35,000 less expensive is still, of course, a matter of perspective.)

Tesla said it still expects to have between 47,000 to 50,000 deliveries in the first half of the year. Though, as the Model 3 begins production, it may face a bit of an optics problem — where it stacks up against the Model S. Tesla also acknowledged the problem in its earnings report.

“Moving past Q2, particularly as Model 3 becomes available, one of our challenges will be to eliminate any misperception about the differences between Model S and Model 3,” the company said in a statement. “We have seen a belief among some that Model 3 is the newest and more advanced generation of Model S. This is not correct. Model S will always have more range, more acceleration, more power, more passenger cargo room, more displays (two), and more customization choices, and Model S, X and 3 will all have equivalent Autopilot functionality. We will continue to clearly communicate these distinctions to avoid any misperceptions.”"

""A couple years ago when the stock was at $200 … you outlined a scenario where you could get to $700 billion in market cap. That's about where Apple was at the time. We're two years later, you're obviously close to the Model 3 launch, how are you looking at that? "" Barclays analyst Brian Johnson asked on Tesla's first-quarter conference call Wednesday, according to a FactSet transcript.



In response, the Tesla founder and CEO said he believes it can reach that valuation because of pioneering development in robots, software and artificial intelligence:

""Well, now I may want to preface this by of course I could be completely delusional, but I think I see a clear path to that outcome. … The set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious. I am heavily involved in Tesla [getting] incredibly good at the machine that builds the machine, which involves, by the way, a tremendous amount of software. This is not just a bunch of robots that are sitting there. It's the programming of robots and how they interact. And it's far more complex than the software in the car. I mean, I think, this is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy. I would not know what to do if I were in their position.""

Tesla's market value is $51 billion through Wednesday, according to FactSet. Apple's current market value is $772 billion after a 27 percent rally this year.



Many investors and auto industry experts are perplexed with Tesla's worth, which is just below General Motors' market value. The electric car maker had a loss of $675 million last year compared with GM's $9.4 billion in earnings.



AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson said in April he finds Tesla's valuation ""inexplicable"" and it was ""either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it's gonna work out.""

Hedge fund manager David Einhorn on Wednesday said ""investors remain hypnotized"" by Musk and so they are ignoring a clear bubble.



""We're skeptical that the company will be able to mass market its Model 3 at volumes and margins that justify the current valuation. The enthusiasm for Tesla and other bubble basket stocks is reminiscent of the March 2000 dot-com bubble,"" Einhorn said on the Greenlight Capital Re first-quarter conference call Wednesday, according to a FactSet transcript. ""While we don't know exactly when the bubble will pop, it eventually will.""



However, Tesla advocates still believe in the company's technological lead and prowess and even hint that the carmaker would one day work with Apple.

Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas, who has some of the most aggressive predictions on Tesla's future ambitions, asked on the conference call if Apple has anything to offer Tesla's mission to ""accelerate the transition to shared autonomy and sustainable transport.""



Musk said: ""Yeah, I don't think they want to have that conversation, Adam. At least I've not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it's cool.""



If Tesla is going to one day be as big or bigger than Apple, Musk plans to stick around to see it happen on his watch.

""I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,"" he said on the call. ""Hopefully stopping before I get senile or too crazy, I don't know."""

Chief Executive Elon Musk’s bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla’s 2016 production.

Shares were down about 2% in after-hours trade following the results.

The automaker’s comments underscored the additional challenge of keeping up demand for its older models.

“We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused” that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call.

Tesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production – within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.

That cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets.

Record deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition.

Tesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S.

Tesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 – which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 – avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

In its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3.

“We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,” Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced.

“The Model S will be better than Model 3,” he added. “As it should be, as it’s a more expensive car.”

Tesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30% increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35% due to the use of remote diagnostics.

The company reiterated its forecast of delivering 47,000-50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of 2017, a target it announced earlier this year.

Still, customer deposits fell 7% in the quarter, which could suggest interest in Tesla’s current product line, the Model S and Model X, is decreasing.

On a per-share basis, Tesla’s net loss narrowed to $2.04 from $2.13.

Excluding items, the company lost $1.33 per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 81 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Tesla’s results reflect the first full quarter that includes solar panel installer SolarCity (scty), which it bought last year.

The Silicon Valley-based automaker last month became the most valuable U.S. carmaker by market capitalization, pulling ahead of Detroit’s auto heavyweights Ford Motor (f) and General Motors (gm).

Up to Wednesday’s close, shares of Tesla had risen 45.6% this year."

With some of the lowest fuel prices in the world, SUVs and inefficient vehicles roam the flashy Emirati city en masse. However, ride-sharing service Uber is now bucking tradition by letting users select a zero-emission option with a fleet of Tesla vehicles.

Uber launched a new UberONE option through its smartphone app, which allows users to choose a Tesla Model S or Model X electric car specifically for his or her ride with a slightly higher fare.

The UberONE service comes via a partnership with Dubai Taxi Corporation, which announced it would add 200 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles this year.

The AP reports that 50 Tesla electric cars are now operable in the UberONE service, and another 150 Model S and Model Xs will join the fleet over the next two years.

Uber's General Manager in the United Arab Emirates, Chris Free, said the partnership with Dubai Taxi Corporation allows riders to experience ""new and progressive experiences.""

Although the fleet of Tesla electric cars provides zero emissions, the Dubai Taxi Corporation was drawn to purchase the electric cars due to their semi self-driving capabilities.

The Dubai Future Foundation wants fully self-driving cars to carry out 25 percent of trips within the city by 2030.

Even though Tesla's Autopilot system does not house complete self-driving capability, CEO Elon Musk promised ""Hardware 2"" will enable fully-autonomous driving once it develops accompanying software and validates it.

Dubai is likely prepping itself for Tesla's potential in accordance with the Future Foundation's goals.

The perks include free parking, charging, and other incentives; Dubai will cull the free charging incentive in 2019, however.

As countries like the UAE begin to deal with the reality that is electric cars and renewable energy production, a shift in economic planning is underway.

Many of these countries fear for their economies as the world starts to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.

Instead, countries such as Saudi Arabia plan for tourism and defense to bolster its economy by 2030; in turn, oil production would not be the largest source of income."

Second in a series of stories about Tesla’s ambitions in China

Part 1: Why Tesla is Struggling in China

Tesla sold just over $1 billion worth of cars in China last year, but that money bought far fewer cars than it would have in the U.S. On average, a Chinese customer pays 1.5 times what an American would for the same Tesla Model S sedan.

A combination of factors contributes to the pricing discrepancy and none of them is an easy fix for Tesla . We’ve read through the Chinese regulations, as well as local media reports. Here are four key takeaways:

Tariffs and Taxes

The Chinese government charges a 25% duty on all the imported cars, plus a 17% value-added tax on top of that. To avoid the 25% tariff and lower its price, Tesla would have to form a joint venture and start manufacturing cars in China. (Tesla recently announced that Chinese Internet firm Tencent had acquired a 5% stake in the company -- a nice cash infusion for Tesla but it’s not a joint venture and won’t change Tesla’s tax hit.)

The problem with any joint venture is it would expose the company’s intellectual properties and technologies to all the venture’s partners. Another complication: the joint venture would have to lose the “Tesla” name in exchange for a Chinese brand name -- not particularly helpful when it’s Tesla that carries the brand recognition.

It seems that Elon Musk is not completely against the idea of “made in China,” though. In 2014, the CEO indicated that he was planning to make cars in China “at some point in the next three or four years.”

Shipping

For now, though, distance is an issue. China is a long way from Tesla’s U.S. factories, and shipping large-sized products like an automobile is never cheap, even in bulk. The estimated shipping cost for Tesla to move its cars across the Pacific, from California to China, is about $3,600 per vehicle, according to a company post in 2014 when the company started selling the Model S in China.

A Stronger Dollar

The retail price of the Model S in China has been rising ever since the company entered the market in 2014. The most recent hike was announced earlier this February, when prices for 11 versions of the Model S and Model X increased by about $3,000. It’s at least the third price adjustment in the past year alone.

The Chinese media has speculated that the recent price changes have been caused by the persistent decline of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar. As the exchange rate is measured, 6.9 yuan are now required to buy one dollar, compared with 6.5 yuan in April 2016, and 6.0 in early 2014.

Government Subsidies

To encourage the use of green cars, given the country’s pollution crisis, the Chinese government issues large tax breaks and subsidies to electric-vehicle manufacturers. But not all of the benefits apply to foreign auto makers like Tesla.

The 10% sales tax on automobiles, for example, has been exempted for approved models of green cars since 2014, Tesla, however, was not included on that exempt list, according to official documents from Chinese State Administration of Taxation. Since the California-based company is not operating as a joint venture with local partners, it also has no access to the generous government subsidies for green cars, which can be up to 66,000 yuan ($9,576) per vehicle.

As local electric-vehicle makers effectively lower their prices with tax cuts and subsidies, Tesla’s already-high price tag becomes even less competitive.

But it’s not all bad news for Tesla in China. Since 2015, a few municipal governments have allowed the American auto maker to enjoy some of the new energy incentives, such as the lifting of driving restrictions and issuance of free license plates, which are tightly controlled for traditional gas vehicles. In Beijing, for example, traditional car owners have to try their luck in the license plate lottery to get one of just 90,000 plates per year. In Shanghai, a license plate for a traditional car could cost a whopping 80,000 yuan ($11,608).

For Tesla, the changes could be first step in really joining China’s electric-car club."
https://www.wired.com/story/lucid-tesla-wannabe-electric-sedan/,pos,1.0,6.193964143019276e-29,Tesla Wannabe Lucid Takes on the Auto Industry With a Stunning Electric Sedan,2017-12-01 12:00:00,2019-06-24 14:20:58.340665,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"While the world's most famous automakers were pulling the covers off their latest, shiniest offerings at the Los Angeles Auto Show, a dark gray sedan circled the convention center, almost silently. Riding on 21-inch wheels, the Lucid Air cuts a muscular stance, its door handles flush with the body of the car, one thin bar of light bars stretching across its front, another along the slightly boxy rear. Fully electric, it offers a tempting vision of the future.

“This is our very precious multimillion-dollar prototype—we are super careful with this machine,” says Lucid’s Chief Technology Officer, Peter Rawlinson. But a prototype, no matter how lovely, does not make a automaker. The Air is the first vehicle from Lucid, a Silicon Valley outfit presenting itself as a new Tesla. Because, as Elon Musk will tell you, there's quite a gulf between designing a great car and producing and selling that car. Tesla may have booked hundreds of thousands of preorders, but it's struggling to meet demand—let alone make a profit.

That's why you likely haven't heard of the other electric car startups that thought they could replicate Tesla's success, like Faraday Future, Fisker, Aptera, and Coda—each is struggling or has folded or fizzled out under the immense financial pressure.

Lucid, which has now built a grand total of five cars, believes it can not only do better than the other startups but also be competitive against the major automakers.

Lucid Air

Usually when I’m offered a ride in an engineering preproduction car, I want to be up front, because that's where the action happens. But the Air—despite a claimed, grin inducing, 0 to 60 mph time of 2.5 seconds—is best experienced from the back. So I sink into one of the two seats, which recline so far back I'm gazing at the LA skyline through the glass roof, feeling like an Apollo astronaut about to be launched into space.

The car is finished beautifully. The wood, leather, and felt that cover the interior are meant to invoke California’s Santa Cruz waves crashing over rocks. As luxury, tech-happy buyers now expect, there are touchscreens everywhere. The ride was slightly harsh, because despite its finishes, this is a hand built test car, without a properly tuned suspension or sound deadening. Lucid promises a range of between 240 and 440 miles, depending on which battery pack you buy.

All very nice, but a comfortable interior, solid performance, and substantial range count as table stakes here. To rake in the chips, Lucid is counting on its CTO, Peter Rawlinson, the man who has done this before. The Brit was the chief engineer for Tesla’s Model S, the sedan that stacked up accolades and made Tesla a real automaker. And he has brought top talent along for the new ride. “I have the key brain power behind the Model S team with me today,” he says. “We know how to do this, and that is the differentiator.”

In fact, he seems relaxed about the company’s prospects, even though he admits no recent automotive startup can truly be classed as a success. “If you exclude Tesla, the last really successful startup was Porsche in the 1950s,” he says. Lucid, which is building a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, has a slow and steady approach in mind. It will start by building 20,000 cars a year, which it calculates will require $260 million in investment. It plans to use revenue from those sales, plus another half billion, to increase production to 50,000 cars a year. It will eventually reach 130,000 cars a year, bit by bit.

“We’re taking a very pragmatic, almost humble approach to it,” Rawlinson says, in a thinly veiled comparison to Tesla's grand ambitions and aggressive timelines. “We’re not going in there all guns blazing, saying we’re going to spend a billion dollars on a factory. That’s madness.”

Lucid has one big advantage Tesla didn't have when it was getting started a decade ago: Electric cars are no longer an odd, ignored corner of the market. Countries from India to Germany to Norway have announced plans to ban gas and diesel engines in the coming decades. In China, the world's largest auto market, government regulators are mandating the sale of electrics on a wide scale.

“We’re talking about a couple million EVs—I don’t know where they’re going to find them,” says Rawlinson, spying an opportunity. “I think we can sell 100,000 units a year of this car, with a 50/50 split between China and the rest of the world.”

The country also has a taste for large sedans with luxurious back seats, if you were wondering why the Air's second row offers more room than a first class plane seat. Together with an alluring vehicle and a tech-heavy team with a proven record, Lucid seems to have a plausible business plan. In a few years, that could be enough to get the new automaker to the point of taking reservations inside the auto show, instead of looping around the edges."

Musk's estimate suggests an even greater backlog than expected. On Tesla's website, the delivery estimate for new Model 3 reservations is ""mid 2018 or later.""

Tesla opened up pre-orders for the Model 3, its first mass market car, more than a year ago. Within a matter of days, more than 300,000 customers put down $1,000 deposits to reserve their place in line.

Tesla hasn't updated the pre-order count since last year, but Musk said Tuesday that ""there are more and more deposits every week.""

""So if you want, then definitely put down the deposit,"" he added. ""The line isn't getting shorter.""

Optimism for Model 3 sales has helped drive up Tesla's stock price in recent months, pushing the company's market cap above traditional automakers like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F).

But the cost of prepping for the launch has also pushed Tesla deeper into the red. It had to raise more than $1 billion earlier this year. Tesla said last month it was ""significantly expanding"" its infrastructure with more retail, delivery and service locations ahead of the launch."

LMC predicts that China’s total will nearly triple in the next two years, while the rest of the world’s will merely double. That is because, in part, Chinese government regulations will require automakers starting in 2019 to sell ever-increasing numbers of electric cars and plug-in hybrids if they want to keep selling gasoline cars. China has also begun research on imposing a rule to ban the sale of internal combustion cars someday.

“China is and will be the largest consumer and producer of electric vehicles in the world,” said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive of Automobility, a Shanghai consulting firm. “If Tesla hopes to compete as a global electric vehicle maker, it must tap the manufacturing and supply footprint of China in order to compete globally.”

China has the steepest barriers to automotive trade of any large market in the world, making it difficult to compete in the Chinese market without producing in the country. Beijing has been able to retain steep tariffs and other obstacles to imports because it insisted that it was a developing country when it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.

The W.T.O. has allowed developing countries to retain much higher trade barriers than industrialized countries, on the theory that they have infant industries that may not have grown big enough to withstand global competition. Today, however, China has the world’s largest auto industry.

China charges a tariff of 25 percent on imported cars, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States and 9.8 percent in the European Union. China also has a 17 percent value-added tax — a kind of sales tax — that is charged not only on the price of the car but also on the tariff, so that the taxes are effectively compounded.

Unlike these taxes, the costs of shipping a car across the Pacific are tiny. They can be as little as 1 percent of the cost of a high-priced model like Tesla’s offerings. “Shipping costs are usually not a big deal — it is the 25 percent tariff” that keeps out imports, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm.

Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has expressed concern about China’s trade practices. President Trump is set to visit Beijing from Nov. 8 to 10, but China has shown little sign of willingness to negotiate on sectors that it regards as strategic imperatives, and electric cars are one such industry."

LAS VEGAS — For the second time, Chinese security researchers were able to hack a Tesla Model X, turning on the brakes remotely and getting the doors and trunk to open and close while blinking the lights in time to music streamed from the car's radio — an effect they dubbed ""the unauthorized Xmas show.""

The complex hack involved sending malicious software through the car's web browser in a series of circuitous computer exploits. They were able to remotely control the car via both Wi-Fi and a cellular connection.

The researchers informed Tesla of their discovery in June of this year and the company patched the vulnerabilities within two weeks, said Samuel Lv, director of the Keen Security Lab at Chinese tech giant Tencent.

In a statement, Tesla said it actively encourages this type of research so that it can prevent potential issues from occurring. The risk to customers from such exploits is very low and Tesla has not seen a single customer ever affected by it, the statement said.

This is actually the second year the team from Keen Security Lab in Shanghai managed to hack a Tesla and remotely engage its brakes.

""We informed Tesla of the vulnerabilities we found last year and they corrected them. This year our research found new vulnerabilities and we were able to reproduce the same remote control of the car,"" said Sen Nie, lead researcher for the car hacking team at Keen Security Lab. He presented the research with colleagues Ling Liu and Wen Lu at a conference of security researchers here.

Nie emphasized that the work was complex and not easily replicated. He also said the researchers don't believe Teslas are inherently more vulnerable than other cars.

Charlie Miller, the hacker who gained fame in 2015 for hacking a Jeep with fellow researcher Chris Valasek, attended the group's presentation at the Black Hat conference Thursday.

""There are only three groups in the world who've successfully hacked cars. The University of Washington in 2010, me and Chris and now these guys. And they've done it twice,"" he said.

The team that Nie leads is part of Tencent, sometimes called the Facebook of China because its mobile messaging apps have more than 930 million users. It is also the world’s largest publisher of video games.

In 2016 Tencent began to broaden its mission, adding security research and consulting. It launched Nie's group focusing on automotive security so that it could work with China’s many companies that produce parts and systems for the global auto industry.

“A lot of OEMs don’t have the knowledge or background to deal with cybersecurity issues. We consult with them to help them evaluate the security of connectivity modules on cars,” said Lv.

In the magazine's test track and on-road tests, the Model S earned a perfect score of 100. Its final score was somewhat lower -- 87 -- because its dependability was rated merely as average, based on owner survey data.

The Emergency Braking software update also applies to the Tesla Model X SUV, but the Model X, despite its similarities to the Model S, is nowhere near as good, in the magazine's estimation. With a score of only 77 and poor reliability, the magazine doesn't recommend the Model X -- with or without Automatic Emergency Braking.

Consumer Reports has called Automatic Emergency Braking critical safety software that ""has helped save lives."" In its scoring, the magazine awards extra points to automakers that have it as a standard feature.

In 2016, twenty major automakers agreed with the federal government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make the technology standard on all vehicles.

The highest rated vehicle of all by Consumer Reports is the Audi Q7 which got a lower score than the Model S in testing, but earned top marks for reliability and owner satisfaction. It's has a final score of 90."

Tesla has been redefining what it means to be an advocate of sustainability since 2003. Through their innovation and technology, they have built some of the most impressive electric vehicles (EVs) ever to be on the market, carving out a new niche in the transportation industry while ensuring that they maintained a significant lead against competitors, and setting new records for quality and performance.

In 2016, they continued improving their vehicles, expanded further than car manufacturing, made significant strides in renewable energy, and moved even closer to the truly sustainable future that Elon Musk envisions for the world.

This year, Tesla announced a subtle name change that speaks volumes about where Elon Musk plans to take the company. Big picture—it’s not just about cars anymore; in fact, it hasn’t been for a while. Elon Musk has shown that there is a lot to look forward to from Tesla.

Tesla in 2017

For starters, this is the year that we will see a fully autonomous Tesla drive across the country—from LA to New York. After this feat is conquered, hopefully without incident, and once the company achieves a significant level of autonomy for their vehicles, they will be launching their own ride-hailing network.

Adding to their sedan range, the company is expected to come out with an electric semi truck, the Tesla Semi, which, according to previous reports, is already in the works. Most of their resources are still focused on bringing the Model 3 to market, but assures the public that the Tesla Semi is already in “early development work.” However, speaking of the Model 3, it will be Tesla’s most affordable car to date, and the company has set production of the vehicle in mid-2017 to meet delivery targets for the end of the year.

Another recent development is the announced partnership between Tesla and Panasonic. This collaboration will have the company ramping up production of battery cells for the company’s Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2.

2017 should also be the year that Tesla makes good on its Supercharger network expansion, through which they plan to double the number of Superchargers in 2017.

On the energy front, the production of solar cells by SolarCity is underway and is on track to meet their target timeline. Also, Tesla’s Solar Roof Tiles, developed in collaboration with SolarCity, are expected to be completed in 2017.

A new Gigafactory is being planned for construction in Europe that will contain the production of both vehicles and batteries, and confirmation of this new site could be as soon as within the year. Tesla is also looking to reach the Indian market, which he hopes will happen towards the second half of 2017. There is even buzz of Tesla securing a manufacturing partner in China, following changes in policy, that will provide incentives for the production of new energy vehicles.

With such a lengthy list of achievements and goals, it might seem that Elon Musk has bitten off more than he can chew. But, based on the past successes of Tesla, and the incredible progress already being made by the company, few could doubt that Musk and his colleagues will create a lot of positive change within the coming months and years. From the ever-increasing repercussions of climate change to the possibilities of privatized space travel, the ambitions of Tesla promise to do a lot more than just build great cars."

It wasn’t that long ago when Tesla seemed like the only company making cool electric cars that you’d want to drive.

If this year’s Los Angeles Auto Show is any indication, that niche no longer belongs exclusively to Elon Musk. After months of signs suggesting a shift in global momentum toward an electric future, some of the world’s most established automakers are starting to reveal what they’ve been working on for the EV world.

The results are not only promising but surprisingly provocative, offering a glimpse of an automotive future that is beginning to feel substantially real. Scroll down for some of the most intriguing examples on display this week.

The MINI Electric Concept

Unveiled by BMW in Germany in August, MINI’s electric hatchback is the company’s first electric concept car. The vehicle will be powered by a lithium-ion battery, but the automaker hasn’t released details about the concept vehicle’s range or efficiency. With the car’s bold yellow accent bar and flashy rims, company officials have touted its design.

“We wanted to create a unique car, a car which has character,” Christopher Weil, head of MINI’s exterior design automotive design at BMW, said in October. “Our aim was to create a car which is beautiful.”

The MINI will be manufactured at the company’s plant in Oxford and will go on sale in 2019, according to BMW.

Jaguar’s I-PACE Concept

Jaguar’s first electric car was on display this week. In addition to zero emissions, the I-PACE Concept offers future drivers 400 horsepower and 0‑60 mph in around 4 seconds, according to the company.

“Our tomorrows will be lit by brighter suns and driven by the noble absolute forces of the universe, and there is a science to such great power,” Jaguar boldly — and dramatically — proclaims in a preemptive strike against those who say electric-powered vehicles are for wusses and hipsters.

The I-PACE will be available beginning in the second half of 2018.

Bollinger B1

Just because it vaguely looks like something that could’ve landed on the beaches of Normandy during World War II, doesn’t mean the Bollinger Motors’ no-nonsense, sport-utility truck isn’t fully electrified. The boxy truck offers all-wheel drive, 360 horsepower and 6,000 pounds of towing capacity, a 200-mile range and a top speed of 127 mph, according to the company.

Bollinger describes the truck “as perfect for ‘rangers, builders and do-it-yourselfers’ — a slightly different demographic than the usual Model X or Nissan Leaf consumers,” auto news website Jalopnik notes.

The company says prospective buyers can “reserve a spot in line” on their website for the truck, which is expected to cost about $60,000.

Volkswagen Bus

Volkswagen’s iconic microbus hit its cultural peak during the counterculture days of the 1960s and 1970s. Though variations of the original model are lionized on Instagram by off-the-grid types everywhere, Volkswagen is hoping a new generation of electric microbuses will again capture the popular imagination when they return to dealerships in 2022.

Volkswagen estimates the bus will have a 300-mile range and a front trunk, like the original VW Beetle.

“Our goal is clear: We want to make the fully electric, fully connected car a bestseller around the world.,” said Herbert Diess, chairman of the board of management for the Volkswagen brand. “The iconic car of the electric age must be a Volkswagen.”

BMW i8 Roadster

Able to reach 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and with a striking exterior that includes butterfly doors and a soft top, the BMW i8 Roadster looks the part of a flashy sports car. And yet, the i8 — which BMW calls “an icon of progress” — is a plug-in hybrid with a 330-mile range. An electric motor drives the front wheels, while a gasoline engine handles the rear.

Assuming the $200,000 Tesla Roadster makes it past production hell and actually hits the road, it will probably face off with vehicles like the i8.

The i8 is already available for about $145,000.

Volkswagen’s I.D. Crozz

The Volkswagen electric concept vehicle I.D. CROZZ, is expected to offer a range of more than 250 miles from a single charge. The company claims owners will be able to charge the vehicle’s battery to 80 percent capacity in only 30 minutes.

The car is expected to arrive at dealerships in 2020. “The cockpits of tomorrow will be packed with technology and still have more comfy room for you,” Volkswagen says.

The ES8, which starts at 448,000 Chinese yuan ($67,765) is half the starting price of Tesla's 836,000 yuan ($126,470) Model X in China.

Nio also enjoys the advantage of Beijing's state subsidies for electric vehicles.

""It's hard to assume"" how this will affect Tesla's sales in China, Nio Founder and Chairman William Li told CNBC over the weekend. ""Maybe Tesla will sell less ... after our product is out. Or probably, because the whole market is growing, they will still maintain growth in sales. It's hard to say.""

""But we do have lots of customers that turned to us from Tesla, and many who have bought buy products from both,"" said Li, who spoke to CNBC on the sidelines of the ES8 launch event.

What is clear is that the two are competitors.

""For sure I think Tesla is our rival in that consumers will choose between our products. But I wouldn't say we are the Chinese Tesla, or they are the American Nio,"" Li said.

A seven-seat electric vehicle, the ES8 is made to order, customizable and equipped with an artificial intelligence system. The car will be able to accelerate to 100 km per hour (62 miles per hour) in 4.4 seconds.

The move to issue junk bonds - lower-quality investments that offer higher yields - represents a bet by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk that bond investors will be as hungry as stock investors to back the company on expectations that its Model 3 will be a hit.

Tesla shares are up 67 percent this year, pushing the company’s market value to about $60 billion, above that of top U.S. automakers General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), even though Tesla has yet to make an annual profit.

“Bond investors, who typically don’t love companies that don’t make money, will be far more forgiving when it comes to Tesla,” said bond expert Robbie Goffin, managing director of FTI Consulting, citing the company’s stellar stock market value.

Tesla was to start pitching potential investors on Monday, IFR reported, citing lead bankers on the deal.

So far, Tesla has been raising money to pay its bills with a combination of equity offerings and convertible bonds, which eventually convert into shares. In March, the company raised $1.4 billion through a convertible debt offering.

Following the announcement, Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed its negative outlook for the automaker and assigned a “B-“ rating for the bond issue - deep into junk credit territory. S&P also maintained its “B-“ long-term corporate credit rating on Tesla.

“We could lower our ratings on Tesla if execution issues related to the Model 3 launch later this year or the ongoing expansion of its Models S and X production lead to significant cost overruns,” S&P said in a statement on the bonds.

Moody’s assigned a junk “B3” rating to the bond issue and said the company’s rating outlook was stable.

The rating agency said the overall company’s “B2” rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of “considerable value” to other automakers.

The automaker’s debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.

CFRA equity analyst Efraim Levy said the bonds provide Tesla with funds “at least into mid-2018.”

“There is a risk they could still run out of money,” he said. “Then you’d go back to the equity markets and hope it’s not too late” to raise more money.

BURNING CASH

The latest effective yield on single-B rated bonds maturing in seven to eight years, the class for a Tesla issue, is around 5.5 percent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Index data.

Tesla’s bond will price later this week after several days of meetings with credit investors, who will weigh factors including the absence of a borrowing history, its lack of profit and its high cash-burn rate against its growth potential and its attractiveness as an environmentally friendly “green” issuer.

Ultimately, the depth of investor interest will determine the bond’s interest rate.

Tesla is counting on the Model 3, its least pricey car, to become a profitable, high-volume manufacturer of electric cars.

Tesla said last week that it had 455,000 net pre-orders for the Model 3, which has a $35,000 base price, and that the sedan was averaging 1,800 reservations per day since it launched late last month.

At the launch, Musk, however, warned that Tesla would face months of “manufacturing hell” as it increases production of the sedan.

Tesla had over $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, compared with $4 billion on March 31.

The company has said it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion in the second half of this year to boost production at its Fremont, California assembly plant and a battery plant in Reno, Nevada.

Tesla’s cash burn has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn to bet against the Palo Alto, California company.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and RBC are the book-runners on the bond offering, IFR reported.

Five members of the Italian Tesla owners club claim to have set a new distance record, travelling 670 miles on a single charge in a Tesla Model S.



The feat, which they say beats the previous record set in Belgium in June by 110 miles, used a longest-range Tesla Model S 100D and required the five drivers to employ so-called “hypermiling” techniques, which saw them use as little energy as possible by maintaining a constant speed, using low rolling-resistance tyres and trying not to use the brakes.

The team said they drove without air conditioning at an average speed of just 25mph (40kmph), reaching 670 miles before coming to a stop with 0% charge on the meter.

Luca Del Bo, president of the club, said: “To complete the 1,078km record distance, we used 98.4 kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to eight litres of gas.

“This has been possible thanks to the very high output of the electric engine that transforms 95% of the energy into motion. Just consider that the most efficient combustion engines today do not exceed 30% efficiency.”

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk congratulated the club on the record, which was issued by a public notary with a lawyer sealing the charge cap before starting the attempt, the club said.

Rosario Pingaro, one of the drivers, said: “The driving was made simply by the semi-autonomous driving system, which helped us to keep a constant speed in the middle of the lane.”

In June, following the Belgian record of 901.2km, Musk said that it would be theoretically possible to drive a Model S more than 1,000km on a single charge with the right tyres. Tesla rates the Model S 100D as being able to drive 514 miles at 45mph on a single charge.

Tesla’s latest car, the mass-market targeted $35,000 Model 3, is rated as being able to travel 215 miles per charge as standard or up to 310 miles with an extended range battery option, which costs more. But electric cars still have some way to go to match petrol and diesel cars, which routinely exceed 500 miles per tank of fuel and can be refilled in minutes, with even the fastest electric chargers taking over an hour to fully charge the large batteries."

The Model 3 is simply the latest iteration of a naming strategy Musk has been planning for years: to launch a car line that spells ""SEXY."" The Model 3 has taken its rightful position as the ""e"" and Tesla's upcoming Model Y will complete his naming plan.

Musk originally wanted the Model 3 to be called the Model E, but Ford beat Tesla to the punch in filing for the trademark.

Needless to say, Musk wasn't thrilled about Ford snagging the name.

""Like why did you go steal Tesla's E? Like you're some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of Sesame Street robber?"" Musk said at the time.

While the origin story of the Model 3 name is funny, the branding has also become a thorn in Tesla's side.

Long-time Tesla fans may know about the joke, but not all potential buyers are up to speed.

The name led some to believe that the Model 3 is a next-generation version of the Model S. That's problematic considering the Model 3 is Tesla's first mass-market sedan and has far fewer bells and whistles with a $35,000 price tag.

Tesla has been so concerned that people are confused by the Model 3 name that it wrote in early May about the need to correct the misperception in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Musk made similar comments on Twitter in March.

Tesla designed a webpage to help correct the confusion, which appears to be paying off.

The company said in its second-quarter earnings letter that there has been growing demand for the Model S and Model X. It's unclear whether that's from Tesla's different marketing approach, but it shows demand isn't waning for Tesla's luxury options just because the Model 3 launched.

Tesla releasing the final specs for the Model 3 also doesn't hurt."

Tesla delivered the first 30 Model 3s to employees at the end of July. At the time, Elon Musk, the automaker’s chief executive and a founder, worried some investors when he warned that Tesla was about to embark on “at least six months of manufacturing hell” trying to get Model 3 production to 5,000 cars a week by December.

But last week, Mr. Musk clarified his comments, saying that Tesla should be able to overcome any supplier issues and other potential obstacles. Mr. Musk said investors should have “zero concern” about whether Tesla would be able to meet its goal of making 10,000 Model 3s a week sometime next year."

But some of those concerns are getting erased in the wake of a new driving record set by a team driving a Model S in Italy.

Driving at around 24 miles per hour, the Tesla driver was able to drive 669.83 miles (1,078 kilometers) on a single charge.

And while the record claim doesn't mention being monitored and verified by an independent officiating organization, none other than Musk himself weighed in with congratulations.

""Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed 1000km on a single charge!"" wrote Musk on Twitter on Saturday. ""Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!""

Another way to put this record is that you could drive from New York to Detroit in a Tesla on a single charge (actually, a litter farther than that).

On Tesla's website, you can calculate the range of various models based on a number of conditions (weather, speed, etc.). But according to Tesla's site, its Model S 100D can travel at least 514 miles driving at 45 miles per hour. That's roughly in the same range as many similarly sized, gasoline-powered cars.

But since no one is likely to drive 24 miles per hour during their entire trip, that nearly 700 mile range recorded by the Tesla in Italy isn't a realistic expectation for most drivers.

Nevertheless, it's still a huge number that'll win over some still wondering if they can truly depend on electric vehicles to get them to their destination."

Hypermiling is a technique used to conserve gas (or in this case, electricity) which involves driving at a low, consistent speed with minimal use of the vehicle’s brakes.

SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is letting 1,000 customers try out the latest version of the brand's Autopilot system, another step forward on the way to fully self-driving cars.

The new system being activated on the limited basis is dubbed Autopilot HW2, or Hardware 2, a reference to the Tesla electric vehicles built after October that are loaded with advanced radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors. The limited dissemination of the Autopilot software upgrade is meant to ensure that any glitches are debugged before a broader rollout.

After initiating the Version 8.1 software update over the weekend, Musk tweeted that Tesla would then ""hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.""

The update includes new features to Tesla's Autopilot partial self-driving system, some of which remain in ""beta"" test mode and are explained with cautionary language that in many cases requires drivers to not only stay vigilant but also keep a grip on the steering wheel.

According to a report on Electrek, a site that closely follows the electric vehicle market, the Enhanced Autopilot now has Forward Collision Warning, which allows drivers to set the distance at which they want to alerted with a chime that a collision might be imminent. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control allows the car to speed up or slow based on traffic around it. And there's Low-Speed Autosteer, in which the vehicle uses lane markings to inch along in traffic while staying centered in a lane.

Tesla was in the spotlight throughout 2016 due to a handful of crashes both in the U.S. and abroad that may have been related to either improper use or compromised operation of Autopilot software.

The most publicized incident occurred last May, when Tesla enthusiast and owner Joshua Brown died after his Model S sedan plowed into a truck crossing its path. The Autopilot system didn't see the truck's white side as an object and failed to apply the brakes. Federal regulators are investigating.

Musk has said that Tesla's new HW2 generation vehicles pack so many sophisticated sensors that ultimately they'll be able to provide fully autonomous driving capability by the end of the year. That said, in its 8.1 update Tesla noted that the rollout ""will be measured and cautious until we have generated confidence across several hundred million miles of real-world usage.""

The coming months are likely to see big strides in autonomous car tech, as companies such as Google, Uber, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Volvo and others look to woo and wow consumers with self-driving features.

The year also promises to be a pivotal one for Musk and his upstart automobile company. Tesla aims to begin producing its entry-level electric sedan, the $35,000 and up Model 3, next summer. Musk has pinned high hopes on Model 3, specifically a brisk production target that will see Tesla's total vehicle output rocket from 50,000 to 500,000 units a year.

Although Tesla has a market cap of $33 billion, Musk recently decided to make things financially interesting by buying SolarCity, a large solar panel company run by his cousin Lyndon Rive.

Musk had been a majority investor in SolarCity, and his mission now is to turn Tesla's stores into one-stop shopping emporiums for solar panels, electricity storage units (so called Powerwalls and Powerpacks) and electric cars.

To make things even more complex, Musk is busy building out a massive Gigafactory in the desert east of Reno, Nev., which will make batteries and, eventually, cars. And that's when he's not at the controls of SpaceX, his rocketry company.

Musk also will sit on a business advisory committee assembled by President-elect Donald Trump that includes Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.

Look for big sparks in 2017 from Tesla, one way or the other.

It also happens to be the only rear-wheel drive version of that car now on the market.

Tesla's Model S 75 costs about $70,000, making it the least expensive Model S currently sold. It has a 348 horsepower electric motor and an EPA-estimated driving range of 249 miles.

Now Tesla (TSLA)'s least expensive Model S will be the 75D, which only comes with all-wheel-drive and starts at $75,000. The S 75D has the same size battery pack as the discontinued model but slightly longer range. The D stands for ""Dual Motor,"" since there are separate electric motors for front and back wheels.

For shoppers looking to pay much less -- and who don't care about having all-wheel-drive -- Tesla's smaller, less luxurious Model 3 sedan recently went into production. Starting prices for that car, currently only available with rear-wheel-drive, are about half that of the Model S. An all-wheel-drive Model 3 will be available next Spring.

All-wheel-drive Teslas get better traction on wet or snowy roads. They also have slightly more range because they use power more efficiently.

All-wheel-drive is a popular option on all sorts of luxury vehicles, according to the automotive Web site, KBB.com."

There’s a mystique about Tesla Motors’ electric vehicles that borders on the cultlike. People believe the upstart, high-tech automaker’s EVs are different from other cars on the road.

They are. But a big part of the Tesla difference isn’t so much about what these cars have as it is about how they are built and, believe it or not, what they don’t have.

The foundation of that difference is that Teslas — the Model S sport sedan, the Model X crossover and the upcoming Model 3 family sedan — have been designed and engineered from the start to be electric vehicles. Tesla didn’t have to make all of the compromises other car companies have made in order to squeeze EV bits into a package never intended to hold them.

Tesla also was founded and is run by a team of people committed to the idea that the passenger car can be both exciting to drive and friendly to the environment, that performance and environmental sensibility aren’t mutually exclusive. And while the cost of a Tesla isn’t low, it’s a price that fans are willing to pay.

There’s a lot of technology on board a Tesla, but remember: Much of the stuff is also available or coming soon on top-tier models from other major luxury carmakers.

The Tesla difference is that all that technology, power and environmental friendliness —and a few things no other carmaker offers — comes in one package.

Here’s a rundown of what makes Teslas special.

1. Design

Not so much the exterior — Teslas are modern, sporty cars, but they still look like cars. The foundation of the Tesla difference is what’s underneath the sleek skin.

Because Tesla designers started with a clean slate, they were able to develop the car around its electric powertrain and battery. The battery pack didn’t have to be squeezed into spaces previously occupied by a gasoline car’s trunk, rear seats or engine bay. And there’s no transmission hump or drive shaft tunnel.

If you look at a bare Tesla platform, you’ll see that it looks a lot like a flat skateboard. That gives the Tesla a fairly roomy interior and lots of cargo space, behind the rear seats as well as up front.

2. The ‘frunk’

The engine bay is where most other electric carmakers put the charger, power inverter, electronic controls and, sometimes, the electric motor. But Tesla integrated all that into the parts of the car you can’t see. That left room under the “hood” for a storage compartment the company calls the “frunk,” or front trunk.

3. Fuel storage

There’s no fuel tank on a Tesla. There is a very large battery pack, which contains the energy storage cells as well as a cooling system and some electronic controls. All that is packaged into a flat box between the frame rails, under the floor pan a few inches above the ground and protected from objects in the road by a titanium shield. This gives the 4,600-pound Tesla a tremendously low center of gravity: The battery pack weighs about 1,200 pounds. That helps it stick to the road on corners or when you are hurrying through the twisties on your favorite mountain road.

4. Instrument panel

Other cars give drivers lots of knobs, switches, soft-touch buttons and even joysticks to contend with.

Tesla puts almost everything onto a massive, center-mounted, 17-inch display screen that provides clear, easy-to-use, on-screen touch controls. The only buttons on the dash are for the glove box release and the hazard lights.

The speedometer and energy systems information are digitally projected onto a driver-facing screen where conventional cars keep their analog and digital dials.

5. Propulsion system

Most cars use internal combustion engines and multispeed transmissions. They have hundreds of moving parts, require regular maintenance and can’t be adjusted without a trip to the shop.

Teslas use electric motors that have two moving parts and single-speed “transmissions” that have no gears. The company says its drivetrain has about 17 moving parts compared with about 200 in a conventional internal combustion drivetrain. The Tesla system is virtually maintenance-free. And because it is controlled by electronics, many adjustments and even repairs to the Tesla system can be made through software adjustments (more about that later).

6. Design (Part 2)

The Teslas’ exterior designs are those of conventional — albeit quite shapely — cars. But because the designers didn’t have to provide space for an engine — which typically results in a larger, wind-resisting front end — they were able to pen a shape that is among the most aerodynamic ever for a four-door passenger car.

That means the Teslas slip through the air rather than bulldoze through, and that helps with faster acceleration time and, more importantly, longer travel distance between battery charges.

7. Electric drive

The mere fact that it is a battery-electric vehicle, or BEV, makes a Tesla different from 99% of the cars sold in the U.S. today.

8. The batteries

Tesla’s battery system sets it apart from all other BEVs. The other guys all use large flat or pouch-format lithium-ion battery cells, while Tesla uses cells made in the common 18650 cylindrical format. That’s the same format, but not the same chemistry, as used in most laptops and tablets. Tesla cells, which use a nickel-cobalt-aluminum-lithium chemistry, have about 50% more energy density than other BEV cells, which helps account for a Tesla’s long range and high performance.

9. Charging speed

BEVs can charge only as quickly as their charging systems — and battery chemistry and heat management systems — allow. Most BEVs use a 6.6-kilowatt charger, which means they can take on juice from a Level 2, 240-volt home, workplace or commercial charging station at a maximum rate of 6.6 kW per hour. Teslas come standard with a 10-kW charger and can be ordered with a double charger rated at 20 kW.

With a properly sized electricity supply, a standard Tesla takes on power at a rate that equates to 30 miles of range per hour, versus no more than 20 miles of range per hour for other BEVs’ chargers. Teslas with 20-kW chargers can gain up to 60 miles of range per hour.

10. Wireless updates

Pretty much alone among all automakers, Tesla regularly provides software updates for its cars and delivers them wirelessly at the driver’s convenience. Most are free and upgrade various functions on the cars. One of the most recent is supposed to improve operation of the Model X’s unique but oft-criticized “falcon wing” doors.

As most Teslas are produced with all the hardware necessary for functions such as the Tesla Autopilot driver assistance system, the company also sells wireless software downloads to activate them. Most other carmakers would require a visit to the dealership, at least, and most likely an expensive vehicle modification along with any new software.

Hanson + Damon Root + Meredith Bragg + John Stossel + Maxim Lott,"""It makes no sense that an American manufactured vehicle would be so challenging to get,"" says Tesla owner Matt Holm. ""You have to jump through so many hoops.""

When Elon Musk launched the first Tesla sports car in 2008, he didn't just set out to create a mass market for electric vehicles; Musk wanted to disrupt the entire auto industry by cutting out the dealership middleman and selling his cars directly to consumers.

Tesla's sales approach has resonated with customers who want a more interactive car buying experience. Holm, a realtor based in Austin, Texas is one of those Tesla converts. He spends a lot of time on the road driving clients in his Model S. He loves the fact that his vehicle doesn't need much maintenance and can be charged overnight in his garage.

But when Matt went to purchase his Tesla, he couldn't just walk into a store and buy one.

""I actually had to go online, configure it, and order it sight unseen,"" says Holm. ""It was like I was a spy or something getting some James-Bond car delivered.""

Unlike the big car companies, Tesla doesn't have a network of independent dealerships that sell its cars. The company runs its own showrooms, but in Texas—along with Connecticut, Michigan, Louisiana, Utah, and West Virginia—the government makes it illegal to walk into a Tesla store and buy a car.

Tesla employees at these showrooms aren't even allowed to give pricing information or to direct customers to the company's website. Test drives require a special permit from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.

Almost every state has some sort of restriction on directly purchasing cars from manufacturers. The purpose of these franchise laws, which date to the 1930s, is to prevent car buyers from cutting out the middlemen—a big political constituency. The Lone Star State has nearly 1,300 franchised car dealerships employing about 100,000 people.

The National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) has repeatedly argued that the current system of franchised dealers is necessary to protect consumers and ensure fair competition. In a speech before the Automotive Press Association last October, NADA chairman Jeff Carlson stated that consumers preferred the dealership sales model and that dealership networks were ""the best, most efficient, and most pro-consumer way of selling new cars and trucks.""

But if car buyers really preferred going through third-party dealers, why do they need government protection?

Car manufacturers have tried to sell straight to consumers prior to Tesla. In the late 1990s, Ford attempted to circumvent the dealerships in Texas by starting its own stores and selling used cars through their own company website. The Texas Department of Transportation ruled that this violated the state's franchise laws and ordered Ford to shut down operations.

Ford was also hit with a $1.7 million state fine. The following year, then Texas Governor George W. Bush signed a law that strengthened protections for the dealership cartel.

Now Musk is taking his own shot at selling direct to consumers. According to figures from the Texas Ethics Commission, Tesla has spent over $1.2 million on Texas lobbyists in the last five years as part of an effort to eliminate the direct sales ban.

Rep. Jason Isaac, a Republican state legislator from Dripping Springs, Texas, introduced a bill in the 2017 legislative session that would get rid of car dealership rules. ""It's truly not a free-market approach,"" says Isaac. ""What my bill basically says is that a manufacturer of an automobile can sell direct to the consumer if they want to.""

But Isaac has come up against the the politically connected Texas Auto Dealers Association (TADA), which opposes any efforts to change franchise laws. TADA claims that allowing Tesla to sell directly to consumers is a violation of ""true free market"" principles by giving Musk and Tesla ""a monopoly just for them.""

Lawmakers didn't act on Isaac's bill this session, making it the third legislative defeat for Tesla's reform effort in Texas.

But Elon Musk's campaign to remake the car industry is a hint of big changes to come. Google plans to bring its autonomous vehicles to market and even Apple, which pulled off one of the greatest retail success stories of the last 20 years by opening its own network of stores, is working on its own car. If Silicon Valley succeeds in its quest to takeover this nearly trillion dollar industry, the dealership model may not last.

""I think consumers are going to start demanding this more and more as they realize, 'Wait there's an autonomous vehicle coming and I can't buy it? Why is that?,'"" states Isaac. ""We've got to find some free market solutions that allow those companies to sell direct to their consumers.""

However, this view comes with the benefit of plenty of hindsight – and even Elon Musk would tell you that it wasn’t always obvious that the company would be around in 2017. There were periods of time when layoffs were rampant, the company’s payroll was covered by credit cards, and Tesla was on the brink of bankruptcy.

Rise of Tesla: The History (Part 1 of 3)

Today’s massive infographic comes to us from Global Energy Metals, and it is the first part of our three-part Rise of Tesla Series, which will soon be a definitive source for everything you ever wanted to know about the company.

Part 1 deals with the origin story of the company, challenges faced by the first EVs, the company’s strategy and initial execution, and the Tesla Roadster’s development.

Tesla was initially conceived in 2003 out of the vision of two Silicon Valley engineers, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The partners had just sold their eReader company for $187 million, and were looking for their next big idea.

The infamous “death” of GM’s EV1 electric car that year ended up being a source of inspiration, and the two engineers started looking into ways to reduce the world’s reliance on Middle Eastern oil and to combat climate change.

The electric car pathway was not just better than the other choices that were out there – it was dramatically better.

– Martin Eberhard, Tesla co-founder

The company was bootstrapped until Elon Musk led the $7.5 million Series A round in February 2004 and became the controlling investor. He joined the board of directors as its chairman, and took on operational roles as well.

At this time, JB Straubel – who famously rebuilt an electric golf cart when he was only 14 years old – also joined the company as CTO.

Initial Strategy

Tesla’s initial strategy was to build a high performance sports car first, for a few reasons:

It would shed the existing stigma around EVs

Sports cars have higher margins

Fewer cars would need to be produced

High-end buyers are less price-sensitive

Instead of building the Tesla Roadster from scratch, the company aimed to combine an existing chassis with an AC induction motor and battery. And so, the company signed a contract with British sports car maker Lotus to use its Elise chassis as a base.

Roadster Debut

The Roadster made its debut at a star-studded launch party in Santa Monica. The 350-strong guestlist of Hollywood celebrities and the press were wowed by the 2-seater sports car with a $100,000 price tag.

This is not your father’s electric car.

– The Washington Post

What the audience didn’t notice?

The Roadsters had many issues that needed to be fixed – these and others would delay Tesla well beyond the planned Summer 2007 delivery date.

The Dark Years

Tesla’s original business plan was built on the idea that the auto industry had changed drastically.

Automakers now focused on core competencies like financing, engine design, sales and marketing, and final assembly – getting the hundreds of individual car parts, like windshield wiper blades or door handles, was actually outsourced.

This was supposed to make it easy for Tesla to get its foot in the door – to focus on the EV aspect and let Lotus do the rest. Instead, the company experienced an “elegance creep” phenomenon. They were able to keep making the car nicer, but it meant customizing individual parts.

Costs spiraled out of control, things got delayed, and the car began to take a very different shape than the Elise. By the time it was said and done, the Tesla Roadster was nothing like its Lotus cousin, sharing only 7% parts by count.

The Revolving Door

During this process, there was a revolving door of CEOs.

2007: Eberhart was forced to resign as CEO in August

2007: Early Tesla investor Michael Marks took the reins temporarily

2007: In November, Ze’ev Drori took over as CEO and President

2008: After less than a year of Drori’s run, Musk stepped in to take over the role in October

At this point, Musk had already invested $55 million in the company, and it was teetering towards bankruptcy.

I’ve got so many chips on the table with Tesla. It just made sense for me to have both hands on the wheel.

– Elon Musk

Some of Musk’s first moves:

He ended up cutting 25% of the workforce

He leaned on friends to help cover payroll, week-to-week

He raised a $40 debt financing round to escape bankruptcy

He formed a strategic partnership with Daimler AG, which acquired a 10% stake of Tesla for $50 million

He took a $465 million loan from the U.S. Dept. of Energy (He repaid it back ahead of the deadline)

He recalled 75% of the Roadsters produced between March 2008 and April 2009

Despite revamping the entire production process – and the company itself – Tesla made it through its most trying time.

The Roadster’s Run

The Roadster wasn’t perfect, but it helped Tesla learn what it meant to be a car company.

It is not just a car, but one of the strongest automotive statements on the road.

– Car and Driver

A total of 2,450 units were produced, and the specs were impressive for an EV. With a top speed of 125 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds, the Roadster helped dispel many of the myths surrounding electric cars.

Meanwhile, the Roadster’s lithium-ion battery also was the first step forward in an entire battery revolution. The 992 lb (450 kg) battery for the Roadster contained 6,831 lithium ion cells arranged into 11 “sheets” connected in series, and gave the car a range of 244 miles.

With the Roadster, Tesla would not only set itself up for future success, but also the transformation of an entire industry.

This was Part 1 of the Tesla Series. Parts 2 and 3, on Tesla as well as the future vision, will be released in the near future!"

Tesla isn't like other companies, and that's both a good thing and a bad thing.

The good part is that Tesla never conducts business as usual and has been given credit even by Tesla shorts such as David Einhorn for turning vague notions of industry ""disruption"" into something that adds up to a $60-billion market cap.

The bad part will yet again hit home next week when Tesla reports third-quarter earnings. Analysts are expecting the biggest loss of the year, possibly more than $3 a share. Tesla has rarely made money, but even by its own standards, Q3 2017 will be impressively negative.

And even if Tesla loses less than expected, it will still lose a lot.

Shares of the company have been sliding over the past month or so, after an epic run-up during the first half of the year that saw the stock briefly threaten $400 while surpassing the market caps of both Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. At one juncture, a company that sold fewer than 100,000 vehicles in 2016 put General Motors in the rear-view mirror.

So the big question for market-watchers next week will be: ""Can Tesla's stock laugh off another huge loss?""

In the past, the final quarter of the year has been a time when facts catch up with investor fantasy and Tesla's momentum starts to flag, so it wouldn't be surprising if shares weaken over the next two months after ascending well over 50% in 2017.

But it also wouldn't be a shock if Tesla hangs in there. It's endured its money-losing ways before. Here are some highlights."

He Left The Washington Post In June,"Most of the best selling cars in America, such as the Honda Accord or Nissan Altima, generally hit around 300,000 in sales every year.

Tesla saw 276,000 people sign-up to buy its newest all-electric Model 3 sedan — in two days.

That massive number, which far exceeded optimistic forecasts, upends traditional thinking about how to sell cars and is expected to spur the auto industry to shift more dramatically to market electric technology to consumers, analysts said.

“We’ve never seen anything quite like this in the auto industry,” said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. “It is unprecedented.”

Mainstream car manufacturers have long dabbled in electric technology and some have made a bit of headway in getting such vehicles on the road. But the category was a niche, measured in thousands — not hundreds of thousands — of cars sold.

Tesla now appears to be doing what no other has so far been able to accomplish — sell electric cars to big crowds.

The company has received nearly as many Model 3 reservations in the past several days as some automakers produce in a single year. Mazda sold 319,000 vehicles in the United States in 2015, according Caldwell. Lexus sold 344,000.

Even if some pre-orders for the $35,000 Model 3 are cancelled — or if Tesla struggles to meet such demand, which many analysts say is likely — the company has shown that consumer appetite for a well-designed car can be robust, even if it is purely electric, said James McQuivey, an auto analyst at Forrester.

“It’s a watershed moment for rethinking vehicles all together. Tesla is putting together the idea a vehicle needs to be cutting edge and cool, more like an iPhone than like a Model T,” McQuivey said. “It’s changing what we mean when we buy a car and what it says about us.”

[The top 7 design features of the Tesla Model 3]

He added: “Years from now we’ll look back and say Tesla started an electric vehicle revolution. But that’s not because the people buying Tesla thought of it as an electric vehicle revolution.”

Some of the additional comfort consumers may now have with electric technology is due to advancements in the batteries as well as the public infrastructure, analysts said. Drivers generally no longer need to fear running out of juice on the road, stranded without a power outlet. The Model 3, for instance, has a range of 215 miles, similar to that of a rival from General Motors, called the Chevy Bolt, which is priced in the low $30,000s.

And the number of publicly stationed superchargers — which can recharge a battery in a matter of minutes rather than hours — will double to 7,200 by the end of next year, Tesla said. The company also expects its network of car chargers to grow to roughly 20,000 locations by the same time.

Of course, some of the intense demand for the Model 3 may simply be the fruits of Tesla’s public-relations strategy, which centers on its charismatic chief executive, Elon Musk. Interest in his newest creation was helped by the critically acclaimed reviews of the company’s more expensive models as well as flashy presentations that featured his cars’ cutting-edge tech, such as the ability to summon the car, with no one inside, through a smartphone app.

[How to buy a Model 3, in 3 simple steps]

“The Model 3’s huge reservation list should serve as a big wake-up call for the rest of the industry,” said Kelley Blue Book analyst Tony Lim. “Tesla just did a lot of heavy lifting to attract attention to the EV segment. Now is the time for competitive manufacturers to begin leveraging this momentum that Tesla created and building awareness to their fully electric vehicles that have comparable performance and appeal.”

The surge in orders is all the more impressive because most people will be paying an average of $42,000 for the Model 3, Musk said. The $35,000 model is a stripped down version.

By comparison, most of the best selling sedans in the country generally cost $25,000 or less.

Indeed, tens of thousands of customers lined up outside Tesla’s stores to order the car last week, with some camping out in tents to make sure they were among the first to put down their $1,000 deposits — even though Model 3 is not expected to be delivered until the end of next year.

“In regards to the recent news, we’re certainly pleased to see such strong demand for affordable long range EVs,” said GM spokesman Fred Ligouri. “We trust that the initial interest from consumers will continue when the Bolt begins production later this year.”

After the company announced its latest pre-order number on Monday, shares of Tesla jumped about 4 percent in regular trading.

Yet significant doubts linger over whether Tesla can ever manufacture that many cars. “Definitely going to need to rethink production planning,” a giddy Musk tweeted Friday when orders for the Model 3 had hit a mere 198,000. Tesla has never delivered more than 5,850 cars in a month, according to estimates by Inside EVs. And it has experienced delays in delivering its SUV, the Model X.

Tesla on Monday said that its “hubris in adding far too much new technology,” the lack of oversight over its suppliers, and not having enough internal capacity led to a shortage of parts for the Model X.

But Musk has expressed confidence in being able to meet demand for the Model 3, noting last week that Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factory had produced 500,000 cars per year — albeit under a different owner."

In May 2016, Brown was on a Florida highway in his Tesla Model S using Autopilot, the semi-autonomous driver assist feature that handles steering and speed during highway driving.

Tesla has always warned drivers that Autopilot isn't perfect. According to car's driving manual and the disclaimer drivers accept before they can engage it, the system should only have been used on highways with clear lane markings, strict medians, and exit and entrance ramps. So when a tractor trailer turning left crossed into the Model S's lane, the system did not recognize it—and the car crashed into its side, killing Brown instantly.

Since then, Tesla has updated the Autopilot system that was controlling the car at the time. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the government's vehicle safety watchdog, concluded in January that because Brown was supposed to be monitoring the car's driving, human error—not Tesla tech—caused the crash. And several automakers have introduced their own versions of Autopilot-like software, which purports to help drivers navigate highways safely while leaving some of the work to the machines.

But now there's a new wrinkle to the story. Tuesday morning, the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent federal body that investigates plane, train, and vehicle crashes, concluded its investigation into the incident. It declared that whether or not Brown paid heed to Tesla's warnings, the carmaker bears some of the blame for selling a system that allowed that kind of misuse.

“The combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system controls resulted in a fatal collision that should not have happened,” said Robert Sumwalt, the chairman of the NTSB.

The NTSB's report is the most substantive rebuke yet of not only Tesla, but an industry eager to offer drivers automated features that can be easily abused—with deadly consequences.

Automation

The automotive industry promises that fully driverless cars will nosedive the roughly 35,000 American road deaths per year, 94 percent of which result from human error. But while roboticists wrangle with the complex problems that stand in the way of full self-driving, carmakers are rolling out semi-autonomous features, which help drivers perform some driving tasks.

Systems like Tesla's Autopilot, General Motors’ Super Cruise, and Audi’s Traffic Jam Pilot already make driving safer, according to preliminary research. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has found that vehicles with front-crash prevention are less likely to rear-end and cause injuries in fellow vehicles. NHTSA's investigation of the Brown crash found that Tesla cars with self-driving capabilities crashed 40 percent less frequently than those without.

“We are inherently imperfect beings, and automated systems can help compensate for that,” says David Friedman, who ran NHTSA for part of the Obama administration and now directs cars and product policy at Consumers Union. “In this case, though, there was a glaring human error and the system made no attempt to compensate for that other than to warn the driver.”

Indeed, these systems are hardly perfect. They mostly just follow lane lines and stay clear of other vehicles, and rely on the human driver to take control if anything goes wrong, like if the lines disappear or the weather gets dicey. Problem is, there's no consensus on how to make sure that person remains alert. And for the NTSB, technology that improves on the status quo but brings with it the problem of recapturing the flighty human attention span isn't good enough.

Before the Florida crash, Tesla's Autopilot system was programmed to give repeated auditory and visual warnings when a driver went a few minutes without touching the steering wheel, but that's where its powers of persuasion stopped. After Brown's death, Tesla used an over-the-air software update to improve that process. Now, if the driver doesn't take the wheel after three warnings, the car will slow to a stop. Other systems, including Mercedes' Drive Pilot, do the same. GM's Super Cruise, coming soon in some Cadillac sedans, takes a different tack, using a gumdrop-sized infrared camera to track the position of the driver's head.

Even that might not be enough. Touching the steering wheel doesn't mean you're looking at the road. Keeping your head straight doesn't mean you're paying attention. And what combination of audio, visual, and haptic alerts is best for bringing someone back to attention is anyone's guess.

Recommendations

Which is why the government should play a bigger role in monitoring the design of these systems, the NTSB (which has no rule-making power) said in a set of recommendations to NHTSA. The federal government, for its part, isn’t quite sure how to regulate all this. In fact, an updated policy guideline released by NHTSA Tuesday made no mention of semi-autonomous features like Autopilot.

""We appreciate the NTSB’s analysis of last year’s tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology,"" says Tesla spokesperson Keely Sulprizio. ""We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.""

When NHTSA concluded its investigation in January, it found that Autopilot hadn’t malfunctioned: Because it was designed for driving on highways with exit and entrance ramps, it wasn't expected to detect a truck turning across the car's path. The NTSB agrees that Autopilot worked as intended in the Florida crash, but recommended that Tesla and other automakers program their systems so they're used only where appropriate. Super Cruise, for example, will only engage when its mapping system confirms the car is on a divided highway. Tesla did not respond to questions about how it might restrict its cars' use of Autopilot.

""The companies developing these systems have to carefully consider how to keep the human in the loop if they want to rely on the human operator as a 'backup.'""

But the bigger question remains, how do you design a system that does the driving, but ensures humans remain ready to jump in when needed?

The newest research out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology indicates what we call “distraction” comes down to situational awareness. It’s not enough to occasionally get drivers’ eyes on the road or hands on the wheel, researchers argue; you need to get them to pay attention long enough to absorb and figure out what’s going on. Automakers could install cameras inside the vehicles to monitor driver attention. It's too late for Tesla to do that for the tens of thousands of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs already on the road. The automaker's new Model 3 does have an interior camera, but the automaker has not revealed how it might be used.

Still, driver-facing cameras may be hard to pull off. “There has been a reluctance across the industry to deploy cameras in the vehicle because at the end of the day there are individual privacy concerns,” says Bryan Reimer, an engineer who studies driver behavior at MIT.

This report may be a bit of a black eye for Tesla, but it's a helpful reminder of where emerging autonomous tech needs a bit of help. ""It highlights that with the introduction of ever smarter technologies, the companies developing such systems have to carefully consider how to keep the human in the loop if they want to rely on the human operator as a 'backup,'"" says Bart Selman, an AI researcher at Cornell University.

That's why the Transportation Board called upon NHTSA, that government body in charge of these kind of regulations, to step up and keep a steady eye on the development of semi-autonomous tech. Just a few hours later, Department of Transportation Elaine Chao announced a new approach to automated vehicle guidelines—one that's much more hands off."

Boudette,"Eight months after a fatal crash involving a Tesla Motors car operating in a computer-assisted mode, federal auto-safety regulators said their investigation of the car found no defects in the system that caused the accident and said Tesla’s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled.

The outcome is a major win for Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has forcefully promoted the car’s technological prowess and ability to prevent accidents. The crash on May 7, 2016, attracted widespread attention and threatened to sidetrack the company’s push toward autonomous vehicles.

The regulators warned, however, that advanced driver-assistance systems like the one in Tesla’s cars could be relied on to react properly in only some situations that arise on roadways. And the officials said that all automakers needed to be clear about how the systems should be used. Almost all major automakers are pursuing similar technology.

“Not all systems can do all things,” said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that investigated the car involved in the May accident. “There are driving scenarios that automatic emergency braking systems are not designed to address.”"

Tesla

When Tesla bought a decommissioned car factory in Fremont, California, Elon Musk transformed the old-fashioned, unionized plant into a much-vaunted ""factory of the future"", where giant robots named after X-Men shape and fold sheets of metal inside a gleaming white mecca of advanced manufacturing.

The appetite for Musk's electric cars, and his promise to disrupt the carbon-reliant automobile industry, has helped Tesla's value exceed that of both Ford and, briefly, General Motors (GM). But some of the human workers who share the factory with their robotic counterparts complain of grueling work pressure they attribute to Musk's aggressive production goals, and sometimes life-changing injuries.

Ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing and chest pains, according to incident reports obtained by the Guardian. Hundreds more were called for injuries and other medical issues.

In a phone interview about the conditions at the factory, which employs some 10,000 workers, the Tesla CEO conceded his workers had been ""having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs"", but said he cared deeply about their health and wellbeing. His company says its factory safety record has significantly improved over the last year.

Musk also said that Tesla should not be compared to major US carmakers and that its market capitalization, now more than $50bn, is unwarranted. ""I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve,"" he said, pointing out his company produces just 1% of GM's total output.

""We're a money losing company,"" Musk added. ""This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It's just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?""

Musk's account of the company's approach differs from that of the 15 current and former factory workers who told the Guardian of a culture which they described as requiring working long hours under intense pressure, sometimes through pain and injury, in order to fulfill the CEO's ambitious production goals.

""I've seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake and smash their face open,"" said Jonathan Galescu, a production technician at Tesla. ""They just send us to work around him while he's still laying on the floor.""

He was one of several workers who said they had seen co-workers collapse or be taken away in ambulances. ""We had an associate on my line, he just kept working, kept working, kept working, next thing you know — he just fell on the ground,"" said Mikey Catura, a worker on the battery pack line.

Richard Ortiz, another production worker, spoke admiringly of the high-tech shop floor. ""It's like you died and went to auto-worker heaven."" But he added: ""Everything feels like the future but us.""

Tesla sits at the juncture between a tech startup, untethered from the rules of the old economy, and a manufacturer that needs to produce physical goods. Nowhere is that contradiction more apparent than at the Tesla factory, where Musk's bombastic projection that his company will make 500,000 cars in 2018 (a 495% increase from 2016) relies as much on the sweat and muscle of thousands of human workers as it does on futuristic robots.

""From what I've gathered, Elon Musk started Tesla kind of like an app startup and didn't realize that it isn't just nerds at a computer desk typing,"" said one production worker, one of several who asked not to be identified by name. ""You really start losing the startup feel when you have thousands of people doing physical labor.""

In February, Tesla worker Jose Moran published a blog post that detailed allegations of mandatory overtime, high rates of injury and low wages at the factory, and revealed that workers were seeking to unionize with the United Auto Workers.

Moran's post shone a spotlight on a workforce that is almost entirely absent from Tesla's official images of the factory.

Michael Sanchez once had two dreams: to be an artist and a car service technician. He said he was ""ecstatic"" when he was recruited five years ago to work at Tesla, a company he believed was ""part of the future.""

Now Sanchez has two herniated discs in his neck, is on disability leave from work, and can no longer grip a pencil without pain.

Tesla said that the employee's injury occurred while he was installing a wheel, but Sanchez said it was caused by the years he spent working on Tesla's assembly line. The cars he worked on were suspended above the line, and his job required looking up and working with his hands above his head all day.

""You can make it through Monday,"" Sanchez said. ""You can make it through Tuesday. Come Wednesday you start to feel something. Thursday is pain. Friday is agonizing. Saturday you're just making it through the day.""

Tesla's manufacturing practices appear to have been most dangerous in its earliest years of operations. The company does not dispute that its recordable incident rate (TRIR), an official measure of injuries and illnesses that is reported to workplace safety regulators, was above the industry average between 2013 and 2016.

Tesla declined to release data over those four years, saying such information ""doesn't reflect how the factory operates today.""

The company did release more recent data, which indicates its record of safety incidents went from slightly above the industry average in late 2016, to a performance in the first few months of 2017 that was 32% better than average. The company said that its decision to add a third shift, introduce a dedicated team of ergonomics experts, and improvements to the factory's ""safety teams"" account for the significant reduction in incidents since last year.

Musk said safety was paramount at the company. ""It's incredibly hurtful and I think false for anyone to claim that I don't care."" The CEO said his desk was ""in the worst place in the factory, the most painful place"", in keeping with his management philosophy. ""It's not some comfortable corner office.""

In early 2016, he said, he slept on the factory floor in a sleeping bag ""to make it the most painful thing possible."" ""I knew people were having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs. I wanted to work harder than they did, to put even more hours in,"" he said. ""Because that's what I think a manager should do.""

He added: ""We're doing this because we believe in a sustainable energy future, trying to accelerate the advent of clean transport and clean energy production, not because we think this is a way to get rich.""

Tesla workers who spoke to the Guardian echoed this sense of pride and enthusiasm for the company's mission. ""We're changing the world,"" enthused Ortiz. ""I can't wait for my granddaughter to one day go to class and say, 'My grandfather was in there.'""

But that pride did not erase what Ortiz described as a prevailing mood of ""mass disappointment"" over working conditions and what he alleged were avoidable work-related injuries.

He recently lost the strength in his right arm, a situation he said was ""scaring"" him. ""I want to use my arm when I'm retired,"" he added.

Others described repetitive stress injuries they linked to working long hours. Before the company reduced the average time of a workday in October 2016, workers said they routinely worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week. Tesla said the change had been ""a success"", and resulted in a 50% decline in overtime hours.

Sanchez and other workers said they believed more injuries occurred because, for years, the company did not take worker safety seriously, with some managers belittling their complaints and pressuring them to work through pain.

When workers told managers about pain, Sanchez said they responded: ""We all hurt. You can't man up?"" Alan Ochoa, another Tesla worker who is currently on a medical leave with an injury, alleged that superiors ""put the production numbers ahead of the safety and wellbeing of the employees.""

The company said that Ochoa and Sanchez are especially outspoken workers whose views do not represent the wider workforce. However, the Tesla spokesperson added: ""In a factory of more than 10,000 employees, there will always be isolated incidents that we would like to avoid.""

Complaints about working conditions at Tesla are not universal. ""I've got benefits, I've got stocks, I've got [paid time off],"" said a worker who has been at the company for about a year. ""I thoroughly enjoy my work and I feel I'm treated fairly.""

Another worker, a temporary employee, said that he sees some teams in the factory doing group stretches in the morning to prevent injuries.

However, some Tesla workers argue the company's treatment of injured workers discourages them from reporting their injuries. If workers are assigned to ""light duty"" work because of an injury, they are paid a lower wage as well as supplemental benefits from workers' compensation insurance, a practice that Tesla said was in line with other employers and California law.

""I went from making $22 an hour to $10 an hour,"" said a production worker, who injured his back twice while working at Tesla. ""It kind of forces people to go back to work.""

""No one wants to get a pay cut because they're injured, so everyone just forces themselves to work through it,"" added Adam Suarez, who has worked at the factory for about three years.

Tesla said it was determined to further improve its safety standards. ""While some amount of injuries is inevitable, our goal at Tesla is to have as close to zero injuries as possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry worldwide,"" the spokesperson said.

Tesla

Musk has a well-documented tendency to promise Mars and deliver the moon. His electric car company was, by his own admission, a gamble. Musk said starting a car manufacturer from scratch was likely ""the worst way to earn money, honestly"", though he caveated that ""maybe rockets are a bit worse"". ""On a risk adjusted return basis, an auto company has to be the dumbest thing you could possibly start.""

The company has succeeded at increasing its production rate every quarter. In the first three months of 2017, the factory produced more than 25,000 cars - a Tesla record. To meet Musk's goal for 2018, they will have to quintuple that rate.

""I think one of the major problems is that people at the top are making unrealistic quarterly goals,"" said a worker on the battery pack line.

Three workers described a management tactic of assigning a monetary value to every delay on the assembly line. ""One time the robot came down and [the supervisor] came back screaming at us, 'That's $18,000, $20,0000, $30,0000, $50,000 because you guys can't get this done,'"" Gelascu recalled.

Tesla argues the challenge in building vehicles from scratch with new production and manufacturing methods should not be underestimated, but that ""nothing is more important"" than protecting the health and safety of its workers.

""We're trying to do good for the world and we believe in doing the right thing,"" Musk said. ""And that extends to caring about the health and safety of everyone at the company.""

It's a more humanistic tone than the one he strikes with investors. ""You really can't have people in the production line itself. Otherwise you'll automatically drop to people speed,"" he told investors in an earnings call last year. ""There's still a lot of people at the factory, but what they're doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But in the production process itself there essentially would be no people."""

Mr. Musk wants to create an alternative to fossil fuels by popularizing solar power and by using batteries to store energy from the sun and wind to power homes, cars and businesses at any time of day and in any season.

But while his clean-energy empire is viewed as visionary — even urgently necessary — by scientists worried about climate change, it has hit a major speed bump. In late June, federal safety officials opened an investigation into the death of Joshua Brown, who was killed when his Tesla Model S smashed at full speed into a tractor-trailer that had turned across its path.

It was the first known fatality of someone operating Tesla’s Autopilot system, a technology meant to prevent such disasters by controlling both steering and braking. Tesla acknowledges that neither the car nor Mr. Brown engaged the brakes, and it says that the Autopilot system failed to see the white trailer against a bright Florida sky.

Critics say Tesla was premature in putting the collision-avoidance system on the market last October — technology that Mr. Musk hailed soon after as “probably better than a person right now.”

And they say Tesla sent a dangerous message by calling it Autopilot, suggesting that the system could operate the car by itself, even though it requires drivers to stay completely engaged in case something goes wrong."

Screenshot/Tesla The California state Assembly passed a $3-billion subsidy program for electric vehicles, dwarfing the existing program. The bill is now in the state Senate. If passed, it will head to Governor Jerry Brown, who has not yet indicated if he'd sign what is ostensibly an effort to put EV sales into high gear, but below the surface appears to be a Tesla bailout.

Tesla will soon hit the limit of the federal tax rebates, which are good for the first 200,000 EVs sold in the US per manufacturer beginning in December 2009 ( IRS explanation). In the second quarter after the manufacturer hits the limit, the subsidy gets cut in half, from $7,500 to $3,750; two quarters later, it gets cut to $1,875. Two quarters later, it goes to zero.

Given Tesla's ambitious US sales forecast for its Model 3, it will hit the 200,000 vehicle limit in 2018, after which the phase-out begins. A year later, the subsidies are gone. Losing a $7,500 subsidy on a $35,000 car is a huge deal. No other EV manufacturer is anywhere near their 200,000 limit. Their customers are going to benefit from the subsidy; Tesla buyers won't.

This could crush Tesla sales. Many car buyers are sensitive to these subsidies. For example, after Hong Kong rescinded a tax break for EVs effective in April, Tesla sales in April dropped to zero. The good people of Hong Kong will likely start buying Teslas again, but it shows that subsidies have a devastating impact when they're pulled.

That's what Tesla is facing next year in the US.

In California, the largest EV market in the US, 2.7% of new vehicles sold in the first quarter were EVs, up from 0.4% in 2012, according to the California New Dealers Association. California is Tesla's largest market. Something big needs to be done to help the Bay Area company, which has lost money every single year of its ten years of existence. And taxpayers are going to be shanghaied into doing it.

To make this more palatable, you have to dress this up as something where others benefit too, though the biggest beneficiary would be Tesla because these California subsidies would replace the federal subsidies when they're phased out.

It would be a rebate handled at the dealer, not a tax credit on the tax return. And it could reach ""up to $30,000 to $40,000"" per EV, state Senator Andy Vidak, a Republican from Hanford, explained in an emailed statement.

This is how the taxpayer-funded rebates in the ""California Electric Vehicle Initiative"" (AB1184) would work, according to the Mercury News:

The [California Air Resources Board] would determine the size of a rebate based on equalizing the cost of an EV and a comparable gas-powered car. For example, a new, $40,000 electric vehicle might have the same features as a $25,000 gas-powered car. The EV buyer would receive a $7,500 federal rebate, and the state would kick in an additional $7,500 to even out the bottom line.

And for instance, a $100,000 Tesla might be deemed to have the same features as a $65,000 gas-powered car. The rebate would cover the difference, minus the federal rebate (so $27,500). Because rebates for Teslas will soon be gone, the program would cover the entire difference - $35,000. This is where Senator Vidak got his ""$30,000 to $40,000.""

The Tesla Model 3 would be tough to sell without the federal $7,500. But this new bill would push Californian taxpayers into filling the void. It would be a godsend for Tesla.

AB1184 would be a huge expansion of the current Clean Vehicle Rebate Project which has doled out 115,000 rebates for $295 million to buyers of EVs and hybrids since 2010, averaging about $2,550 per rebate.

Under AB1184, hybrids and hydrogen powered cars are not included, and rebates for plug-in hybrids are slashed - perhaps to keep Toyota's technologies at bay.

Even the current, relatively small Clean Vehicle Rebate Project has been lambasted as a subsidy for the wealthy who can afford to spend $100,000 on a set of wheels. A study, cited by the Mercury News, showed that of nearly 100,000 rebates, over 80% went to Californians with incomes over $100,000. This notion of a subsidy for the wealthy also applies to the federal rebate.

So California's program was adjusted last year to cut rebates for wealthy buyers and increase rebates for low and moderate income buyers. That hurt Tesla. Another reason for a new program to make Tesla whole.

I admit, I'm not totally impartial. Our next car will be an EV. Something with the performance of a Chevy Bolt would be able to handle 99% to 100% of our driving needs - commuting in the Bay Area and driving to surrounding recreational spots, and very rarely a little further. We don't haul horse trailers across the Rockies.

By the time we're ready to get rid of our internal-combustion-engine car, battery technology will have improved further. We'd even pay a little more, just to get the benefits of an EV. My wife drives 45 miles a day; she'd no longer have to go to the gas station. The EV would be charged at night in our garage. Fuel savings would be substantial. Maintenance hassles and costs would be slashed - a benefit for me. And EVs are great to drive.

We'll buy that EV even without incentives if they go away by then, though we'll try to maximize any incentives with a grateful nod to our beaten-up fellow taxpayers. But piling on incentives is no longer the way to go. Piling on incentives that might be $10,000 or $20,000 or more per vehicle is insane. Piling on incentives to support a money-losing company that will soon lose the benefit of the federal subsidy is going way too far.

How will the funds be extracted from taxpayers? California's Cap and Trade has already been short-listed. Senator Vidak, whose district is beautifully gerrymandered from Fresno to around but not including Bakersfield, put it this way:"
https://www.inc.com/kevin-j-ryan/tesla-taking-risky-new-approach-to-customer-service.html,pos,0.9999999968819739,3.1180255901261056e-09,Tesla Is Taking a Risky New Approach to Customer Service,2017-08-18 15:48:00,2019-06-24 14:21:46.244100,Staff Writer,"At a critical juncture, Tesla is taking a new approach to customer service.

The company has dealt with a few high profile customer service complaints in recent years, most notably from a car owner who sued the company after he says it stopped responding to his emails and calls about repairs. (Tesla has refuted several of the customer's claims.) Other customers complain that they had to wait weeks for repairs after the release of the new Model X last year.

Now, the electric-car maker is rolling out a big change that might prevent similar issues. The company revealed that it is now allowing customers to escalate their issues directly to a company executive. Jon McNeill, the company's president of sales and service, made the announcement on the Tesla Motors Club forum this week. It was first spotted by Elektrek.

The change comes as Tesla enters a critical stretch in its history. The company, led by Elon Musk, has received about 400,000 pre-orders for its new $35,000 Model 3 and wants to ship them all within a 12-month span. The first batch of Model 3s rolled off the assembly line last month.

The company has shipped about 250,000 vehicles total, which means that the number of Tesla vehicles on the road worldwide will double sometime in the not-too-distant future.

Tesla is already making other customer-facing changes in anticipation. In June, it revealed that it's building 100 new service centers, a big jump from the 150 it currently has. The locations for those facilities will be decided using the addresses of customers who have ordered Model 3s. Tesla is also rolling out 350 new on-demand service vans across the country.

With the new feature, Tesla owners will be able to log into their My Tesla accounts, then choose an option that reads, ""Escalate this concern for executive review."" It's a somewhat risky tactic--with a quarter million car owners and climbing, it's inevitable that some customers will abuse the system and eat up employee man hours. But the risk could be worth it if it gives Tesla's already fervent fan base another reason to love the company--and it could help Tesla avoid the bad PR that customer blowups can cause

Tesla, which currently has a market cap of about $50 billion, has taken some heat lately from analysts who believe the company is overvalued. Some, like prominent Greenlight Capital investor David Einhorn, have gone so far as to predict that we're in a Tesla bubble.

The next few months will go a long way to determining whether those things are true, or whether the company is worthy of the hype. Tesla currently manufactures about 20,000 cars per quarter, and it hopes to produce 500,000 in 2018."

Priced at $35,000, it’s an impressive vehicle that looks to update the automotive experience by turning the car into a gadget. But there was something in there that makes me pause. My colleague Lauren Goode noted that Elon Musk took minimalism seriously and in addition to the single display screen and missing vents, fixtures like the interior handles have been replaced with buttons. This worries me, because I’m reminded of all the times something went wrong with the electronics in my first car.

My first real car was a 2002 Mini Cooper, and I have to say, I loved that car for how it handled and felt while driving it, but I had issues with how it was designed: there were a lot of things controlled by electronics, and they didn’t always work the way they should have.

Over the years, a couple of notable things went wrong. The keyless entry failed soon after I bought the car — I never was able to figure out if it was the transmitter or receiver — and it was one of those things that was just too expensive to fix for a post-college graduate. (My current car, a 2013 MINI Countryman, only has the valet key to open the door.) This particular model had a physical key, which made this less of a problem, save for that time when the lock froze on one particularly cold winter. The driver’s side exterior handle failed on a couple of occasions. The driver’s side window motor froze at one point, but the kicker was the rear hatch, which opened not with a mechanical latch, but an electronic button just above the license plate. The placement of the button seemed to be the root cause: moisture, salt, and mud from the roads corroded the button and wires, and let in quite a bit of water that killed it. I never actually used the hatch all that often, so I was able to get by for months while I saved up to buy the part, only to find that the months of inactivity froze up the hinges, which snapped the moment it was finally opened.

I get it: things like electronic locks and windows are commonplace in vehicles, and they’re generally reliable. It’s nice to be able to lock the car remotely or not have to crank a window down manually. But electronic systems can break down, and when they do so, it’s a real problem. I’m of a mindset where a mechanical fix is usually a simpler solution. In the case of my MINI’s rear hatch, an elaborate electronic system just seemed like overkill, and when it broke down, fixing it was far more expensive than its low-tech counterparts.

I wasn’t exactly on the bandwagon to go out and get a Model 3 before, but word that it’s relying almost entirely on electronic systems makes me less likely to jump on. You need working electronics for everything with the Model 3 to just about everything, from opening the door to starting the car. You don’t need a key for the car: you just need your smartphone, a third-party device that means that you’ll be relying on the health of your battery, apps that are up to date, and the like to make sure that you can use the vehicle. I’m sure that it’ll be fine: I’m sure that Tesla has figured out these sorts of contingencies, but it’s complicating something that is pretty tried-and-true when it comes to cars (except for those cold Vermont winters).

But what about the myriad of systems, motors, and wires that supports all of these components? Cars break down, and electronics can be fussy over the life of the car, and they’re expensive when they break down. This isn’t always an instance of normal wear and tear due to weather. These cars will rely on a considerable amount of software that’ll need to be updated periodically. That doesn’t always go as planned: Lockstate accidentally bricked a bunch of their LS6i smart locks with a software update, requiring some of them to be shipped back to the company. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that this could happen to a vehicle somewhere down the road, and it’s not a situation that I’d ever want to be in.

When I look at the Model 3, which requires a virtual button to open the glove box, and another button to open the doors to get out, it feels like a recipe for problems, should a wire go out or some connection gets corroded. Certainly, car manufacturing and electronics have come a long way since 2002, but there’s times when I really appreciate having a mechanical latch that’s relatively easy to repair in case something does go wrong."

Reuters/Mike Blake • Valuations of Tesla vary wildly.

• The company is fueled financially by a ""story"" about the future.

• It could be a decade before it's possible to properly value the company.

Generally speaking, investors want a precise assessment of what the companies they invest in are worth.

Valuation is both art and science, of course, as there's never a guarantee that a company will perform better in the future than it has in the past. But analysts strive mightily to favor the science side as much as possible.

Viewed through that lens — or spreadsheet — Tesla is confounding. Going by the most obvious number, the stock price, Tesla is worth $355 per share and has a market cap of $60 billion.

If you flew in from an alien planet where some type of money exists and math is used to value intergalactic undertakings, you'd be baffled: How can a company that makes vehicles and sells them for $100,000 on average post extremely infrequent profits?

You'd look at other companies that do the same thing, observe that General Motors and Ford have been steadily profitable for years and have piles of money in the bank, and ponder with some consternation the attitudes of investors on this strange planet of baffling valuations.

The confused alien scientist problem

Didn't Elon Musk warn us about you guys? BBC

I think everybody who tries to figure out what Tesla is really worth finds themselves in the position of the confused alien scientist. The bulls and bears on Wall Street are far apart, with price targets ranging from $464 at the high end to $155 at the low end. Valuation expert and NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran is what I might call a coolly rational bear — he likes Tesla's chances, but he considers it to be wildly overvalued at the moment:

""My expected revenues for Tesla in ten years are close to $93 billion, a nine-fold increase from last year's revenues and a higher target than the $81 billion that I projected in my July 2016 valuation. Second, the operating margins, while still negative, have become less so in the most recent period, reducing reinvestment needs for funding growth. The free cash flows are still negative for the next seven years, a cash burn that will require about $15.5 billion in new capital infusions over that period. With those changes, the value per share that I estimate is about $192/share, about 20% higher than my $151 estimate a year ago, but well below the current price per share of $365.""

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations reveal that Tesla will have to raise about 20% of its roughly projected revenue of $80 billion over a seven-year period, meaning that the revenue, while outwardly impressive, is going to be expensive. Basically, Tesla has to raise $2.2 billion per year to achieve $11 billion-$12 billion in annual revenues.

This is, believe it or not, a move in the right direction, as Tesla's 2016 revenues of $7 billion cost the company just over $5 billion, with an equity raise that year of about $1.5 billion — and a healthier amount of cash on the balance sheet at year's end than expected (although as Tesla launches the Model 3 in 2017, it expects to spend itself down to $1 billion, and it recently undertook its first junk-bond issuance, bringing in $1.8 billion at a near investment-grade rate of 5.25%).

If Damodaran is right, then Tesla's cash needs and infrequent profits will catch up with it at some point over the next few years and, combined with a general downturn in auto sales in the US (Tesla's biggest market), probably rationalize the stock price. Essentially, the future will arrive, and it won't be as prosperous as the more bullish analysts now think.

Don't count on it

Tesla has surged year-to-date. Markets Insider

That said, shares at $192 will still represent a huge gain from Tesla's 2010 IPO price of $17. And Tesla's legacy of volatility could fade, with shares tracking more closely to the company's business fundamental and farther from the pie-in-the-sky story of total auto-industry disruption that has propelled the market cap past the likes of Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

I'd call this the best-case scenario because Tesla won't be going out of business, but it also won't be subject to heavy short-selling or ultra-bullish predictions that forecast the company taking control of over half the US annual auto market ( I'm looking at you, Gene Munster).

Tesla's Model 3 handover event. Screenshot/Tesla

Don't count on it, however, because cooler heads have always seen Tesla as being worth around $200 per share, optimistically, assuming that a massive amount of new competition doesn't hit the electric-vehicle market over the next decade. This is a reasonable assumption, as EVs are much more expensive than gas cars (even Tesla's ""mass market"" Model 3 is priced more like a BMW 3-Series luxury sedan than a Honda Civic) and overall EV sales now add up to only about 1%.

At various points in 2017, Tesla has surged toward $400 per share, undermining that thesis.

As an investor, you literally lose money trying to fairly value Tesla as a company. And while the stock now looks pricey, if Tesla can build enough cars to fulfill its roughly 500,000 pre-orders for the Model 3, the appearance of all those vehicles on the road — with the attendant free PR — might send shares into orbit, regardless of whether Tesla is able to sell the Model 3 profitably.

Two equally unappealing options

So we're left with two unappealing options: Value Tesla based on its actual business and lose out on a massive investment gain; or go with the flow, forget about rational thinking, and hope that you can leave the party before everything comes crashing down.

Obviously, there's a third option: Sit Tesla out. I hold no Tesla stock for conflict-of-interest reasons, but I've spent enough time pondering the company's financials to conclude that the bankruptcy risk is low while the possibility of the carmaker being accurately valued in the future is high.

If Tesla executes on CEO Elon Musk's vision, then it will be a more ""normal"" company with good chances to be steadily profitable in the future, with a stock that appreciates predictably and, if the global EV market grows, substantially after the 2030 period.

Then it will be possible to figure out what Tesla is really worth. And to invest accordingly."

Significantly fewer rebates have been doled out his year — $60.3 million through Sept. 28, compared with $71 million in the same period in 2016 — but that’s mostly because the state imposed income limits in mid-2016 so the rebates wouldn’t go strictly to wealthy buyers.

https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-plan-rule-auto-industry-app-purchases/,pos,1.0,5.408473319802207e-17,Tesla’s Plan to Rule the Auto Industry? In-App Purchases,2016-06-10 11:00:27,2019-06-24 14:21:54.051855,Jack Stewart + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"Introducing a new Tesla Model S with a 60 kilowatt-hour battery, a 200-mile range, and a lower price didn't require redeveloping the pack, revamping the assembly line, or reconfiguring the supply chain. All it took was a few lines of code.

That's because the Model S 60 and its all-wheel-drive sibling, the 60D, carry the same 75 kilowatt-hour battery Tesla Motors already puts in the Model S 75. Engineers simply tweaked the software to limit its capacity by 20 percent. This lets Tesla quickly and easily offer a model at a lower price—thereby goosing sales—and gives customers the option of upgrading down the line as their needs and budgets change.

It sounds crazy: Tesla is building overly capable cars, limiting their use, and selling them at a discount—then charging $9,000 for an upgrade. Tell the dealer you want more range, hand over your money, and Tesla presses a button. Zap. Software update. Gamers, of course, recognize this for what it is: an in-app purchase, in a car.

It's Nothing New

Tesla does this already. Customers who pay $2,500 for Autopilot are simply paying to have the software activated. Tesla already installs the cameras and radars—the stuff that actually costs money—in every car. Early adopters who didn't get automatic access to Tesla’s network of Supercharger stations can add it for $2,500. The hardware needed to quickly suck down electrons is already on the cars, they just needed the software. In the early days of the Model S, Tesla planned to offer a 40-kWh battery. So few people ordered it, the company ditched the pack, installed handicapped 60-kWh packs and gave owners the option of paying ten grand to remove the training wheels.

The company says it is giving buyers more options and flexibility. If you skimp on Autopilot but decide you want it a year later, you don't need a new car. If a new job brings a longer commute and a raise, paying $9,000 for 20 percent more range becomes a great option.

Tesla didn't invent this move. ""The electronics industry has for many years put out products that are essentially the same, but which they can sell to different consumers at different price points,"" says Erik Gordon, who studies technology commercialization at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. There's even a term for it: crippling.

Back when having separate hi-fi components was the epitome of cool, for example, manufacturers segmented the market to draw a wider range of buyers, Gordon says. The top-of-the-line gear might have knobs for high, medium, and low frequency tone adjustment. The cheap version offered only high and low controls, even it shared the same guts. It's counterintuitive, but the hardware was cheap, and sticking to one production line was more efficient.

Tesla's key advantage is its ability to enable those crippled features with a few clicks on a keyboard at virtually no cost and charge the customer thousands of dollars for them.

Playing Games

This is where the parallels with the app industry come in. From Battle Camp to Candy Crush to Angry Birds, you've accepted that a “lite” version is free and the really cool features cost money. Developers hope to hook you on the free stuff so you're willing to pay for more. Tesla does the same thing.

It’s not hard to imagine other automakers following along, given that over-the-air updates will grow more common. Want satellite radio? Tap in your credit card details to enable it. Your phone died and you absolutely need the navi system you skipped at the dealer? No problem. It's one quick purchase away. Didn't pay for heated seats because you bought the car in Miami, but now live in Minneapolis? You get the point. In the past, automotive dashboards had black plastic blanks where the features you didn't pay for would have been. These days, filling them is a simple matter of updating software.

If you’re doing this well, you’re not cannibalizing $90,000 car sales, you’re picking up $60,000 car sales which would have been zero. Erik Gordon, University of Michigan

With à-la-carte option ordering, the prices of features are unlikely to be fixed. Automakers could offer a discount on bigger batteries during the holiday travel season, or on additional safety features when your kid starts driving. This raises the possibility of a black market for hacks to enable these features at no cost. Who'll be the first to jailbreak a Tesla?

The Short Game

Tesla gets another advantage from this approach: It keeps sales up. Some people almost certainly are holding out the $35,000 Model 3 slated to arrive late next year. A cheaper Model S could bring them into the Tesla ecosystem sooner.

""If you’re doing this really well, you’re not cannibalizing $90,000 car sales, you’re picking up $60,000 car sales which would have been zero—they would have bought a Prius or something else,"" Gordon says.

It's worth reminding Elon & Co of a cautionary tale called the Osborne effect. In 1981, the Osborne 1, the first portable computer, put the Osborne Computer Corporation atop the tech world with one of the steepest revenue growth curves ever seen. But the company announced the second generation model before it was ready. Sales of the first gen plummeted. A year later, the company was done.

Tesla doesn't want the Model 3, which is far from ready for production, to kill Model S and X sales. The new Model S 60 may make bring less profit than an S 75, but it's more than nothing, with the added possibility of selling an upgrade down the line. (The company won’t comment on its margins.)

And even if the current owner doesn't spring for the upgrade, the next one almost certainly will. When someone trades in an S, Tesla can easily enable the full suite of features and sell it at a higher price used than it otherwise could have. All it takes is a few lines of code to keep the money rolling in."

Putting all that aside, though, even his grumpiest critics will have to acknowledge that Musk has just pulled off something genuinely astonishing. To wit: His company built the world’s biggest battery. In record time. On a bet.

How Twitter changed South Australia’s energy future

Our story begins in South Australia, in September 2016, when an apocalyptic storm — involving 80,000 lightning strikes and at least two tornadoes — knocked down dozens of electricity pylons, causing cascading failures throughout the regional electricity grid and casting virtually the entire state of 1.7 million residents into darkness.

Most people had their power restored within 24 hours, though in some cases it took much longer. But there were more blackouts from storms in December, and more from heat waves in February.

Conservative Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, somewhat predictably, tried to blame the state’s recent turn toward renewable energy. Partially in response, the head of Tesla’s battery division, Lyndon Rive, claimed the company could build out 100 to 300 MW of batteries in 100 days and solve South Australia’s power problems at a stroke.

Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes took to Twitter to ask if they were serious.

Lyndon & @elonmusk - how serious are you about this bet? If I can make the $ happen (& politics), can you guarantee the 100MW in 100 days? https://t.co/av38xcizNo — Mike Cannon-Brookes (@mcannonbrookes) March 9, 2017

Musk replied with characteristic Muskitude:

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Later that month, the South Australian government unveiled a $550 million energy plan meant to respond to the crisis and stabilize the grid going forward. Part of that plan involved contracting for around 100 MW of energy storage.

Today South Australia is taking charge of our energy future. Find out more: https://t.co/nZMuYIdVLE — Jay Weatherill (@JayWeatherill) March 14, 2017

So Musk got a chance to see his bet through. Tesla won competitive bidding for the entire energy-storage portion of the project in July. The contract was signed on September 29, kicking off the 100 days (though at that point, Tesla was half-finished already). By November 23 (around 40 days shy of the deadline), the battery bank was already finished. Musk’s $50 million — the rough cost of the project — is safe.

Congratulations to the Tesla crew and South Australian authorities who worked so hard to get this manufactured and installed in record time! https://t.co/M2zKXlIVn3 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2017

Tesla’s big battery

The battery bank — composed of Tesla PowerPacks — was installed in early December and is attached to the 325 MW Hornsdale wind farm, in construction near Jamestown, South Australia. The farm is owned by French renewable energy company Neoen, which contracted with Tesla for storage to create the “Hornsdale Power Reserve.”

The 100 MW/129 MWh battery bank can store enough energy to power about 30,000 homes for about an hour.

It will be the world’s largest lithium-ion battery farm, but not for long. It won’t even be South Australia’s largest for long. The Lyon Group recently began construction on a project northeast of Adelaide that will involve 3.4 million solar panels (with a capacity of 330 MW) alongside 1.1 million batteries, or 100MW/400MWh worth — the world’s biggest solar-and-storage installation.

And it’s already helping out the grid. According to Renew Economy, the battery was able to respond faster than a backup generator when a 560MW coal-fired unit tripped without warning last week. It didn’t avert a blackout, but it showed how handy the battery can be.

Two cautionary notes

Tesla’s achievement here is impressive. While the company’s electric auto business may be endlessly in question, it is consistently outperforming expectations on the battery side. Batteries at this scale, at this cost, at this speed, were not conceivable 10 years ago, even five years ago.

That said, two notes to temper our enthusiasm.

First, the other part of South Australia’s energy plan is to incentivize local natural gas production and build its own 250 MW gas-fired power plant, to cut down on imports of coal power from neighboring Victoria. (South Australia shuttered its last coal-fired power plant in May of 2016.)

Of course, natural gas is an improvement on coal power, and a good complement to renewables, but that power plant is also a big, long-term source of greenhouse gas emissions. Completely decarbonizing the power sector is key to any serious plan to constrain global warming.

In a sense, South Australia is running a real-time competition for which can more quickly and reliably compensate for the loss of coal: renewables and storage, or natural gas. It’s not enough for Tesla to have a successful one-off project — eventually, renewables+storage must outperform natural gas so decisively that investment shifts. That’s the real bar to clear.

Second, it is true that massive storms have destabilizing effects on wind farms — they drive wind turbines up and down so quickly that many of them shut down for safety. The fluctuations and loss of power threaten the larger grid’s reliability. So adding substantial storage to wind farms (and to the transmission grid more broadly) is part of the reliability and resilience story.

But the other part is the distribution (local) grid, not the sources that feed it.

It is the loss of power lines that drives most blackouts — more reliable power plants can’t entirely compensate for that. Greater resilience requires a more resilient grid, which requires a more modular architecture, with microgrids that can island off and keep important loads running, and more sophisticated data, sensing, and automation to help isolate faults before they cascade.

So if Musk really wants to ensure South Australia’s energy security, he should next turn his attention to local grid resilience — to microgrids that can tie together and aggregate the state’s bountiful distributed-energy resources. That is the natural next step for a company focused on long-term sustainability.

Hey Elon: Bet you can’t build a robust, self-sufficient Tesla Microgrid in South Australia in 100 days!"

Here's Why,2017-11-27 02:00:00,2019-06-24 14:21:55.595644,Staff Writer,"Editor's note: Inc. magazine will announce its pick for Company of the Year on Monday, December 11. Here, we spotlight a contender for the title in 2017.​

Just about every time Tesla looks like it's peaked, it goes and outdoes itself. Last year it was the unveiling of solar roofs and the acquisition of SolarCity. This year, Elon Musk's company kicked things into even higher gear.

For starters, the company eclipsed Ford and, momentarily, GM in market value when its stock surged above $313.00 a share in April. By June, its stock had reached $386.99--a 75 percent increase since the end of 2016. That's a market capitalization of more than $60 billion despite Tesla's having shipped just 76,000 cars in 2016, or about a 10th as many as each of its incumbent rivals.

But Tesla's allure, to Musk fans and company shareholders alike, has always been in what it has promised. 2017 is the year it started delivering on those promises. The $35,000 Model 3, the so-called electric car for the masses, began rolling off the assembly line in late July. While manufacturing of Tesla's most affordable model yet has been, perhaps unsurprisingly, behind schedule, Tesla is still ramping up its capacity and has said it expects to deliver all 400,000 preorders by the middle of next year.

By that time, Tesla should also have introduced all four of its initial styles of solar roofs. When the company acquired SolarCity late last year, and then changed its name from Tesla Motors to just Tesla, it became clear that Musk's firm was becoming a full-blown energy company. Musk's ""Master Plan,"" after all--first outlined in 2006--called for exactly this. ""The overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company),"" he wrote in 2006, ""is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.""

Now, Tesla stands poised to do just that: help lessen the world's reliance on fossil fuels and turn its focus toward renewable energy. Because if a solar roof looks and costs the same as a regular roof, but can harvest the sun's energy and use it to power a home, why would anyone ever buy a regular roof again? And if a car costs the same as a slightly higher-end sedan, but can run by battery and go 215 miles on a single charge, why wouldn't it became one of the most desired vehicles on the market? Those are the philosophies that are propelling Musk and his vision forward--and giving the company's stockholders reason for excitement.

But Tesla's progress isn't without consequences. A May report by the Guardian detailed the tough work conditions at the company's Fremont, California, factory, revealing that hundreds of ambulances have been called over the past several years for injuries, fainting, and dizzy spells.

And even with the aggressive mushing of its employees, Tesla has struggled to hit its goals. After Musk tweeted that the company expected to manufacture 1,500 Model 3's in September, it ended up making just 260 in the third quarter.

""Elon's never made a number, ever,"" Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, which holds Tesla shares, told Bloomberg in October. ""Coming up short is what we expect of him.""

Still, Musk's inability to hit short-term targets has, to this point, been largely overshadowed by his ability to produce breakthrough innovations. ""This guy has figured out how to land a rocket on a ship,"" Gerber said, referring to SpaceX's reusable rockets. ""Whatever it is, he'll get it sorted out."""

Now five major battles remain for the electric automaker.

This week, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed a lower court’s decision that had forced Tesla to close its stores in the state. Industry trade group Missouri Automobile Dealers Association sued the Missouri Department of Revenue in 2015, alleging that Tesla’s method of selling directly to consumers violates state law because it’s not a franchisee.

Tesla has a different business model than other automakers. The company sells its own cars directly online and through its own branded stores, not through franchised dealerships. All U.S. states have laws that prevent automakers with existing franchisees from opening their own dealerships to compete with them. However, dealer associations in a number of U.S. states have tried to expand the law to include manufacturers like Tesla that don’t have franchise dealers. In at least two case, GM backed efforts to shut Tesla or any company from selling directly to consumers.

Last year, a Cole County Circuit judge ruled in MADA’s favor and determined that Tesla’s motor vehicle dealer license should not be renewed. Tesla was forced to temporarily close its two Missouri stores as it awaited a decision in the court of appeals. The company was allowed to reopen the stores as its case went through the appeals process.

The Missouri Court of Appeals dismissed the case Tuesday, giving Tesla an important win. In its ruling, the appellate court said MADA lacked a standing to sue and reversed the court’s earlier decision.

“We respect the Appeals Court decision, although we certainly disagree with its findings,” MADA said in a post on Facebook.

Tesla has long argued that its model ensures the best possible experience for its customers, a point it reiterated this week.

“The decision today is a victory for Missouri consumers who want the choice to learn about and purchase their Tesla in their home state,” a Tesla spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We have been serving customers in Missouri for almost five years and have contributed to the state economy and jobs for Missourians – something that will now continue.”

Tesla’s war with auto dealers, and in some cases automakers, isn’t over yet. The company is prohibited from selling directly to consumers in Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas, and Utah. Tesla also faces some headwinds in New York, where a cap has been placed on the number of stores it can operate.

Tesla does have stores, or “galleries,” in Connecticut, Michigan, Texas, and Utah. In these stores, Tesla customers can look at the cars but not buy, test drive, or even discuss the price. Tesla doesn’t have a gallery in Louisiana, but the company is about to open a service center in New Orleans.

In short: Tesla has legal and policy work left to do. And there’s nothing preventing dealerships in once-safe states from renewing their fight against Tesla.

One of the bigger fights is in Michigan. In October 2014, Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill initiated and backed by the Michigan Automobile Dealers Association that effectively bans Tesla from selling directly to consumers in the state.

In September 2016, Tesla filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan Southern Division after the state rejected Tesla’s request for a“Class A” license, which would have allowed the automaker to open a company-owned dealership in the state. Tesla applied for the license to test the limits of a state law that prevents it from selling vehicles there directly to consumers, the company said back in February 2016.

Tesla opened in December 2016 a showroom in Michigan, taking a bold stance in the home of the Big Three U.S. automakers.

The fight in Texas is particularly problematic for the automaker because the state legislature meets in regular session every two years. The legislature will next convene in January 2019."

That's been true for some time, as Elon Musk's firm has pushed its way into the energy sector over the past two years.

But now the company is making it official. A new SEC filing on Wednesday revealed that the company will change its name from Tesla Motors to Tesla Inc. The filing was first spotted by Business Insider.

The move is indicative of Tesla's changing business model since Musk co-founded it in 2006. Initially a maker of high-end electric sports cars, Tesla has shifted into energy products like solar panels and home batteries. It also agreed to acquire SolarCity, which Musk co-founded, in November for $2.3 billion.

Tesla's solar roofs, unveiled in October and set to launch later this year, will collect solar energy and power homes and electric vehicles. Musk says an installation will cost the same as that of a regular roof, and that the roofs will be 98 percent as efficient as standard solar panels. To ramp up its production, the company will soon begin manufacturing solar panels at Panasonic's plant in Buffalo, New York.

Tesla also recently introduced the second generation of its Powerwall home batteries. About the size of a suitcase, they collect excess energy from the sun and the solar grid and store it for later use. The company's larger Powerpack home batteries are used mainly to power commercial buildings--or can be bundled to form an energy-storing power plant. Tesla brought its first such plant online earlier this week, as part of a public grid in Ontario, California.

Those batteries will primarily be made at Tesla's massive Nevada Gigafactory, which began mass producing lithium ion cells in January. Musk claims that when the factory is complete, it will produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced in the entire world in 2013.

Tesla's shift into energy hasn't been by happenstance: Musk's intention to move the company toward solar energy has been on the company's site since 2006.

Even so, his decision to merge Tesla with SolarCity was not without its critics. The solar company has never posted a profitable year, and the deal was perceived by some analysts as a SolarCity bailout. Several Tesla shareholders sued to attempt to block the acquisition, which was eventually overwhelmingly approved by shareholders from both companies.

Tesla, which for a decade used the domain teslamotors.com, acquired the tesla.com domain in February 2016. It had been owned since 1992 by Stu Grossman, an engineer and Nikola Tesla fan who left it virtually unused."

(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is on the fast track this year. It's gained 53.7% through July 18, versus the S&P 500's 11.1% return.

This performance has naturally increased investor attention. Before considering investing in any company, one of the first things you should know is exactly how it makes money. So let's look at how CEO Elon Musk's growing Tesla empire brings in its green.

The charts below show how the company's revenue and gross profit broke out by segment in its most recently reported quarter, the first quarter of 2017. Because quarterly revenue can be lumpy for many businesses, it's generally best to look at a longer period of time, such as the most recent one-year period, when examining how a company makes its money. However, doing so here would provide an inaccurate picture of Tesla's current business because it's only owned Solar City since November.

Revenue breakout by segment

Segment Q1 2017 Revenue Percentage of Total Revenue Automotive $2.29 billion 84.8% Energy generation and storage $213.9 million 7.9% Services and other $192.7 million 7.1% Total $2.70 billion 99.8%*

The auto category, which accounts for nearly 85% of Tesla's revenue, includes sales of the company's new electric vehicles. In the first quarter, the company sold two high-end vehicles: the Model S sedan and Model X crossover. Starting in the third quarter, this category should also include sales of the company's first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, which Tesla expects to begin slowly delivering this month. Like all new vehicles produced since last fall, the Model 3 will be equipped with all the hardware needed for full self-driving capability. So Tesla's vehicles should simply need over-the-air software updates to activate full self-driving capabilities once autonomous vehicles become legal on public streets across the country, making the stock a solid play on driverless cars.

Vehicle production in the first quarter increased 64% from the year-ago period, which enabled the company's deliveries to jump 69% to a new quarterly record of 25,051 vehicles. The big surge was driven by Model X deliveries significantly increasing, as Tesla experienced some production issues with the crossover that hampered deliveries in the year-ago period.

Its energy generation and storage business sells solar panels (with solar roof tiles coming soon) for homes and energy-storage products -- the Powerwall, for residential use, and Powerpack, for commercial or electric utility grid use. These are rechargeable lithium-ion battery stationary-energy-storage products that Tesla makes at its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada.

Tesla's services and other segment primarily includes revenue from vehicle service and sales of pre-owned Tesla cars. This segment's mix has changed considerably. Early on, it got a big boost from now-defunct partnerships with Mercedes' parent Daimler and Toyota, which included such things as jointly developing EVs and sales of components such as powertrains. These automakers were early Tesla allies, but once it became obvious that EVs were going to go mainstream, they became competitors implementing their own EV strategies and pulled the plug on partnering with Tesla.

Gross profit breakout by segment

Segment Q1 2017 Gross Profit Gross Margin Percentage of Total Gross Profit Automotive $626.9 million 27.4% 93.9% Energy generation and storage $62.2 million 29.1% 9.3% Services and other ($21.2 million) (11%) (3.2%) Total $667.9 million 24.8% 100%

Keep in mind that Tesla is not profitable -- it posted a net loss of $330.3 million, equating to a loss of $2.04 per share, or $1.33 per share on an adjusted basis, in the first quarter. With that said, we can still look at the relative profitability of the company's segments since it provides segment gross margins and the necessary data to calculate each segment's gross profit.

Its energy business has a slightly higher gross margin than its auto business. Investors shouldn't be concerned about the services and other segment: Tesla does not try to make money on this segment, but rather aims to roughly break even, which it wasn't far from doing in the quarter. Tesla's almost surely going to need to increase its overall gross margin in order to achieve profitability.

Where Tesla's business is heading

We can't know for sure what Tesla's business will look like far in the future, but we can predict with some degree of confidence what the company's business will look like in the nearer term.

It's a pretty safe bet that Tesla's revenue is going to continue growing at a torrid pace. This year's revenue will get a nice lift from the Solar City acquisition and should also get a big boost from initial sales of the Model 3. Sales of the mass-market EV should drive 2018 revenue growth. Wall Street expects Tesla's year-over-year revenue to jump nearly 65% to $11.53 billion this year followed by a nearly 71% leap to $19.67 billion in 2018, for a near tripling of revenue in just two years.

It's tough to forecast what the auto/energy revenue mix will look like even in the near term. Tesla's outlook for the energy business, provided when the company released first-quarter results, was limited to saying that this business is ""positioned for accelerating growth later this year.""

On the radar is another revenue source, which should also help boost sales of Tesla's EVs: Tesla Network, an autonomous ridesharing service that will allow Tesla vehicle owners to pick up some cash by using their vehicles to ferry passengers around. Musk announced this platform last fall, but when it actually starts operating naturally depends upon when fully autonomous vehicles get the green light across the land.

As for profitability -- which ultimately drives stock prices -- it's anyone's guess when Tesla will be in the black. Wall Street analysts don't foresee a profit for at least the next five years, and I'm on board with that opinion. For now, the company's stock performance indicates that investors remain confident that Musk's vision of building an integrated sustainable energy empire will at some point translate to a profitable company. You must believe this in order for Tesla to be a right stock for you."

Not just any car, but a Tesla Model S inside a tunnel being dug beneath Los Angeles by Elon Musk's Boring Company. Proof once and for all that a car can, uh, fit inside of a tunnel.

Oh, right, you're not supposed to drive through the tunnel yourself. The plan is for regular cars to be lowered down on a lift to an awaiting ""electric skate"" that will transport vehicles along magnetic rails at speeds of up to 124 mph (200 km/h).

The test tunnel being built beneath SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, just outside of Los Angeles, is a proof of concept. A dry run, if you will, that will let Musk and Co say, ""See, I've safely built a two-mile-long underground test tunnel, now give me the approvals I need to build my first Hyperloop.""

So yes, it's a car in a tunnel — but it's also the proverbial canary in a coal mine that should be a warning to those who profit off entrenched forms of transportation."

The world's largest lithium ion battery has begun dispensing power into an electricity grid in South Australia.

The 100-megawatt battery, built by Tesla, was officially activated on Friday. It had in fact provided some power since Thursday due to demand caused by local hot weather.

South Australia has been crippled by electricity problems in recent times.

Tesla boss Elon Musk famously vowed to build the battery within 100 days - a promise that was fulfilled.

""This is history in the making,"" South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said on Friday.

The battery would prevent a repeat of a notorious incident last year where the entire state lost power, Mr Weatherill said.

Mr Musk has described it as three times more powerful than the world's next biggest battery.

From Twitter bet to reality

The idea began when Mr Musk was asked on Twitter if he was serious about helping to resolve South Australia's electricity woes.

Mr Musk said he was - adding that if the battery wasn't built within 100 days, the state would receive it for free.

The countdown began on 30 September after a plan was approved by the state government and regulators. Tesla finished the battery in about 60 days.

Located near Jamestown, about 200km (125 miles) north of Adelaide, the battery is connected to a wind farm run by French energy company Neoen.

When fully charged, the battery can power up to 30,000 homes for an hour. However, it will mostly be used to support and stabilise existing electricity supplies.

The battery consists of a grid system that runs on the same technology that powers Tesla's cars.

In a statement, the company said the completion of the battery ""shows that a sustainable, effective energy solution is possible"".

Power surge

The battery in South Australia is just one of several similar projects with which Tesla is involved.

Smaller banks of batteries, also intended to smooth out power supplies, are also installed in Southern California, Hawaii, New Zealand, in the UK and on several Pacific islands. Luxury hotels in South Africa, on islands and in remote locations are also using small power storage systems.

The company has also talked about sending more battery packs to Puerto Rico which lost almost all its power generating systems after Hurricane Maria swept across the region.

Retailer Target and online giant Amazon have also expressed interest in storing power. Amazon said it was piloting a program to use the batteries at data centres. The power source would keep servers running if electricity is cut and help keep supplies stable.

Tesla said the expertise it built up building lithium-ion batteries for its cars helped it develop the bigger power packs for the energy storage systems. The batteries used in energy storage facilities that connect to the grid are not exactly the same as those seen in Tesla cars but have some design elements in common.

Tesla has partnered with Panasonic on the development and production of its Powerpack technology. Despite this, it partnered with Samsung on the Southern Australia facility because Panasonic could not produce the required batteries within the tight deadline.

Tesla will soon be facing stiff competition from power firms. Next year, a battery storage facility 50% larger than Tesla's in Australia will be turned on in South Korea. Chinese firms and many other renewable energy firms are also installing many battery storage systems for power suppliers around the world.

The Tesla model S is one of the most renowned electric vehicles on the market. The cheapest, 75D model, boasts an impressive range of 416 km (259 miles), while the 100D and P100D have ranges of 539 km (335 miles) and 506 km (315 miles), respectively. What if you wanted your Model S to go farther? Sure, you could stop and charge it at one of Tesla’s supercharger stations, but what if you didn’t have to stop and could instead drive for, say, another 500-600 km? All it would take is a little hydrogen.

As reported by The Drive, a gas supplier in the Netherlands called Holthausen Group managed to boost the maximum range of Tesla’s Model S by essentially hacking in a hydrogen power source. The company’s success at making an electric- and hydrogen-powered Tesla makes them the first in the world to do so. They even gave it an appropriate name: Project Hesla.

Since Tesla wasn’t involved in the process, the Model S was acquired second-hand. Getting the Model S to accept hydrogen as a fuel source wasn’t easy, with Holthausen Group engineer Max Holthausen calling the vehicle’s system “a big maze.” Holthausen had to develop and implement a workaround, which only upped the difficulty of the project.

In the end, the team made it work; the Hesla now utilizes two power sources. The first is the already-installed battery, and the second is the hydrogen stored in tanks installed inside the vehicle. It’s actually fairly simple to understand how this works: hydrogen molecules are pumped into a fuel cell, where an anode removes their electrons, which pass through a circuit to the battery to give it additional charge. The hydrogen (now ions) then pass into a cathode, where they are reunited with electrons, and bind with oxygen to form water, i.e., H2O, and exit the fuel cell. Compared to the Model S P100D’s aforementioned range of 506 km (315 miles), the Hesla’s incredibly efficient fuel cell allow it to travel nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) using a fully-charged battery and full supply of hydrogen.

Is Hydrogen the Way to Go?

Hydrogen has the potential to become a mass-produced alternative to gasoline and even electricity thanks to seawater and a specific aluminum alloy, but don’t go trying to convert your own Tesla — or any electric car — just yet.

First of all the incorporation of hydrogen power costs an inordinate amount of money. According to The Drive, the hydrogen conversion costs upwards of $58,000 dollars — tacked on top of the $79,500 Model S price tag. Then there’s the issue of replenishing the hydrogen supply. It’s not impossible, but not as convenient as recharging an electric car. There are only 39 hydrogen fueling stations in the U.S., with most located on the West Coast — specifically California. The other four are in South Carolina (2 stations), Connecticut (1), and Massachusetts (1).

Despite the scarcity of refueling hydrogen tanks and the cost of the entire process, Holthausen is still moving forward with its Project Hesla. The company aims to perfect its prototype, to acquire more data over the next several months. If these tests provide pertinent information, it could give other companies that have invested in hydrogen-powered vehicles the technical savvy to catch up to the race. Of those presently relevant, Honda is releasing hydrogen cars, Toyota has a hydrogen-powered truck, and Mercedes Benz debuted its hydrogen-fueled SUV in September.

These cutting-edge companies constitute the first big automakers with fully-functional hydrogen vehicles on the road, but Holthausen and the Hesla could prompt still more ambitious parties to invest in hydrogen fuel in the near future."

In an event that spanned over three and a half hours, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CTO JB Straubel—in addition to a series of Tesla executives—candidly discussed many of the issues and problems that plagued a young, inexperienced, and cash-strapped Tesla in its early days. Musk also talked about more recent problems for Tesla, like challenges with getting the software and doors to work on its Model X, an electric SUV car.

Musk said that he thought Tesla (TSLA) had a 10% chance of succeeding when he started the company, working with engineer and co-founder Straubel. Musk described their early efforts building the company as having “no idea what we are doing,” and “completely clueless.” Musk said he wanted to put in 99% of the Series A funding because he thought the company’s chances were so low that he didn’t want to lose investors’ and friends’ money.

Straubel said the early Tesla employees knew the risks and felt the same way, but that they thought it was “worth taking the risk” if they could make a positive effect on the world.

Musk noted that when the company has made mistakes over the years that it was because they were being “foolish or stupid,” but not because they had nefarious motivations. We’ve always had “the right motivations,” said Musk, adding, “We say the things that we believe even when sometimes those things are delusional.”

The creation of Tesla was based on some false principles, which “turned out to be staggeringly dumb,” Musk detailed, as he regularly referenced a sweeping visual timeline that started in 2003 when he met Straubel and ran to the present. One false principle was that the company’s first car, the Roadster, could be built around core technology from a startup based in Southern California called AC Propulsion, which made drive trains for an electric sports car called the Tzero.

For more on Tesla’s Model X watch our video.

That technology from AC Propulsion could not be reproduced and commercialized, said Musk and Straubel. That was partly because the information system that ran the motor was analog, instead of digital, so engineers had to rewrite all of the code involved. Another reason was because the AC Propulsion battery pack was air-cooled, which didn’t provide enough cooling for batteries that get hot when they discharge to power an electric car. Tesla later converted the Roadster’s battery pack to be liquid-cooled instead.

Another false premise was that Tesla could just use the AC Propulsion tech and stick it in a car body supplied by Lotus Cars, a British car maker. There were major issue with converting the technology to fit it in the small Lotus car body, including that the battery pack was just too big for the car and Tesla had to stretch the car’s body. In addition, the Lotus car couldn’t use the air conditioning system because that relied on the gas engine power, so Tesla had to remake the air conditioning system.

It wasn’t a good idea to simply convert an existing gas-powered vehicle (in Tesla’s case, the Lotus car) into an electric one, said Musk. Changing a car from gas-powered to battery-powered, also invalidated all of the crash tests and safety standards that the Lotus car had already achieved.

In the end, Tesla used 6% to 7% of the original technology from AC Propulsion and the Lotus body union, said Musk. “We needed new all new suspension, all new brakes,” Straubel noted. Musk compared the Roadster development process as similar to wanting to build a house, but instead of building it from scratch, taking an existing house and modifying everything in it but one wall in the basement.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

The result of this hodge podge of technology, among other things, was that there were serious issues with early Tesla Roadsters. At the end of the shareholder event, an early Roadster owner asked Musk a question, and Musk responded by first apologizing to the customer for technical problems that the owner most likely had experienced.

Musk told an anecdote of how he gave Google (goog) co-founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin a test ride in an early Roadster and divulged that the car wouldn’t drive above 10 miles per hour. “I was like I swear guys it goes way faster than this,” said Musk. The Google founders “were kind enough to put a little money in the company despite the world’s worst demo,” reminisced Musk.

Musk and Straubel launched the Roadster during a launch party in 2006. After giving potential Tesla customers rides all night at the party, “the cars were destroyed” from overuse, remembered Straubel. The team ended up pumping ice water into the cars to cool down the batteries, said Straubel.

One of the biggest issues with the early Roadsters was that the transmission didn’t work, recalled Musk. The car technically passed all regulations, but “was completely unsafe,” it “broke down all the time,” and it “didn’t really work,” said Musk. It was stuck in second gear, he added.

Part of the Roadster technical problems were because of the outsourced and slow production process. In the traditional auto industry, auto suppliers from all over the world will send an automaker parts over many months and the automaker might not know if there’s a problem for maybe 6 months. That means that the automaker might have been selling faulty car tech for a half year.

From 2008 to 2009, Tesla decided to redesign its entire production process, said Musk, rebooting the design of car, the technology, changing out many of its suppliers, and bringing a lot of its tech in house. We had the misguided idea that anything built in Asia was better and cheaper, said Straubel.

Originally Tesla decided to buy its battery packs from a supplier in Thailand that made barbeques, but the technical and organization problems were insurmountable. In 2008, Tesla brought its battery pack production in house to its small operations at the time in San Carlos, Calif. “Manufacturing things in the Peninsula is considered super mad,” said Musk of the move.

Tesla didn’t start selling Roadsters with a positive gross margin until the end of 2009. In essence, Tesla lost money on every car sold before then.

Part of the reason that Musk wanted to air some of Tesla’s missteps was because he said he wants entrepreneurs building new things to know they can make mistakes and start companies in areas in which they don’t have a history.

Tesla is a much more stable company now than it was close to a decade ago. But the company still has faced some major technical issues with its recent cars, in particular with its Model X SUV. The software to control the sweeping doors of the Model X has been very difficult to manage, admitted Musk.

The problems with the Model X likely aren’t behind Tesla just yet. “We’re almost there in making the doors useful,” promised Musk, adding that in a month or so, the doors will likely be better doors than regular doors—but they aren’t right now.

This high-flying lifestyle isn’t actually behind the company. It’s still a core tenant of how Tesla operates.

Tesla is still taking major risks and operating like the nimble startup it once was, despite being a public company with an over $30 billion market cap. Whether that’s still a good idea or not at this stage remains to be seen, but Tesla has managed to survive so far.

Next up for the company: build the world’s largest battery factory, launch a mainstream electric car, and sell batteries to power buildings and the energy grid. No big whoop, right? It’ll likely be some of these lessons learned—adjusting to mistakes, rethinking systems, and the long hours it takes to accomplish those tasks—that could get the company there."

SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla Motors announced Wednesday that its electric cars will be the first in the nation to all be fitted with the hardware they need to drive themselves.

CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday that the automaker's Model S, X and forthcoming Model 3 sedan will start being outfitted with ""the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.""

That constitutes full Level 5 autonomy, which doesn't require any driver involvement. That's the ultimate goal for a range of automakers and tech companies, including Google, Ford and Volvo, which have vowed to produce such self-driving vehicles by 2021.

Musk did not say exactly when such technology would be consumer-ready, although he did say regulatory hurdles would have to be vaulted first.

""It's not up to us, it's up to the regulators, and we hope things don't become balkanized and different in every state,"" he said. ""It's a question of what the public and regulators think is appropriate. The system will always be operating in 'shadow mode,' though, so we can gather a lot of sophisticated data to show where software could have acted or not acted.""

This next-generation of Tesla's Autopilot, as it calls the partial self-driving feature it has in the cars now, will have eight surround cameras that provide 360 degree visibility at up to 250 meters of range. There are also 12 updated ultrasonic sensors that can detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the existing Autopilot system.

""It’s all Tesla Vision software, we're not using any third party software for the vision procession,"" Musk said on a conference call with reporters. ""It’s our neural net.""

Musk was upset with the media about focusing on the few accidents that may have been related to Autopilot. ""If you're dissuading people from autonomous driving, you're killing people,"" he said, referring to the million-plus people who die world-wide die in cars due to human error.

As for the details of the technology, Tesla says in a statement that it will have ""forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.""

Musk said a Tesla automobile would soon amount to being ""a supercomputer in a car,"" referencing new vision, sonar and radar processing software that is run by a computing system 40 times more powerful than what Tesla first introduced.

Musk said consumers would have two options when buying a Tesla. ""You should be able to go from freeway onramp to exit and maneuver with enhanced Autopilot, then there's full self-driving which will take care of much more complex environments,"" he said.

Michael Harley, analyst for Kelley Blue Book, felt that assembling an array of tech that can pull off autonomous driving isn't the tough part. ""The most critical piece of the puzzle, which is missing from Tesla’s announcement, is the car-to-car communication that ensures full Level 4 autonomous riding is safe for passengers and pedestrians alike,"" he said.

New York University professor and The Sharing Economy author Arun Sundararajan was impressed by Musk's bold move, but remained concerned that society at large would put the brakes on making full autonomy a reality for quite some time.

""Until we figure out all the edge cases and train the cars to deal with them, this regulatory path will be slow,"" he said. ""Sure, federal regulations will set standards for the brain of the car, but each city, state and local government can dictate what is on its roads. And cultural acceptance comes not just from the experience of the person driving, but the experience of the others on the road. We have to get comfortable not just with being in these cars, but having them around us, on our streets, near our schools.""

Tesla shares (TSLA) closed up 2% Wednesday, and trading was flat after hours.

In a series of tweets Thursday, Musk said that the car can recognize a disabled bay and know not to park there.

News of the Tesla Network was in a disclaimer about the self-driving functionality on new Model S vehicles. Musk said on Wednesday Tesla is building new vehicles with the necessary hardware to eventually enable full autonomy, although the software is not yet ready.

“Please note that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year,” read the disclaimer.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for more detail.

Car makers have rushed to invest in so-called mobility services, hoping to capture the potential trillions of dollars in revenue from selling both vehicles and such on-demand services, while carving out a stake in the industry dominated by Uber.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to investors on Thursday that although a Tesla Network could “excite the market” over its potential earnings stream, it was a costly proposition.

“While we think ride-sharing/hailing is the future of mass-market mobility, we have some financial concerns with the idea of an OEM-owned fleet,” Johnson wrote.

Venture capitalists and corporate investors had poured nearly $28 billion into the ride services sector in the past decade as of June, according to a Reuters analysis.

General Motors has made the biggest bet, investing $500 million in Lyft in January. GM’s upcoming electric Chevrolet Bolt was designed expressly with car sharing in mind, executives have told Reuters.

Money-losing Tesla (tsla) lacks the deep pockets of GM, and ride services companies like Uber and Lyft burn billions of dollars in price wars to secure regional dominance, as occurred with Uber in China before it ceded to local rival Didi Chuxing.

In his “Master Plan, Part Deux” in July, Musk outlined a system in which a Tesla owner could add a car to a shared Tesla fleet using a phone app, allowing it to “generate income for you” and lower the cost of ownership.

Tesla's calling card for the Model 3 is that it's the company's first mass-market vehicle.

With the sedan's starting price of $35,000, Tesla isn't wrong to tout its affordability. But the car could cost a lot more by the time you get through the ordering process. Here's what you need to know.

The base Model 3 is pretty bare

Most will want to purchase the Model 3's Premium package, which includes features that are usually standard, like the ability to adjust the front seats automatically and a covered center console.

The Premium package costs $5,000 and includes things like LED fog lamps, two rear USB ports, and a tinted glass roof with ultraviolet and infrared protection.

With that package, you're looking at $40,000 all in.

Enhanced Autopilot costs extra

Tesla's Model 3 does not have an instrument cluster. Instead, everything is displayed on a center console. Tesla The Model 3 comes equipped with the necessary hardware to support Tesla's second-generation Autopilot system, but you need to pay an extra $5,000 to activate it.

According to Tesla, Enhanced Autopilot will eventually allow the car to match its speed to traffic conditions, automatically change lanes without driver input, merge on and off highways, and park itself. The summon feature will also work in more-complex environments, like parking garages.

Tesla is pushing out the features over time. Those who have paid for the system on the Model S and Model X have access to first-generation features like active cruise control, forward collision warning, and Autosteer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also said the hardware will eventually allow the cars to fully drive themselves. Those who purchase a Model 3 can pay for future access for an additional $3,000 on top of Enhanced Autopilot.

It may be worth holding off, though.

Musk said earlier this month that Tesla may delay its big demonstration of the technology. Additionally, the federal government has yet to finalize regulations for self-driving cars. You might as well save a couple thousand dollars until there is a more concrete rollout plan.

At the very least, if you want the true Tesla Autopilot experience, you're looking at $45,000 for the Model 3.

Extra touches

This is standard across the auto industry, but a paint job other than black will cost an extra $1,000. You can also elect to get 19-inch Sport wheels for an additional $1,500.

The base Model 3 can drive 220 miles on a single charge and accelerate to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. For $9,000, buyers can get a Premium Model 3: a sedan with a bigger battery that will bump the range to 310 miles and improve acceleration to 5.1 seconds.

Tesla will first produce Premium Model 3 cars, so those who want to stick with the base price have a longer wait ahead of them.

It's also worth noting that access to Tesla's massive Supercharger network, a huge perk of owning the vehicle, now costs a small fee.

Tack on those features, and the Model 3 hovers in the mid-$50,000 range.

So what's standard?

The pearl-white paint job on the Model 3 costs an additional $1,000. Timothy Artman/Tesla As is the case when purchasing a car from any dealer, any additional features are entirely up to the customer.

Tesla's base price is high for its segment. Most mass-market sedans hit about $30,000 after they are fully optioned. In fact, a base Model 3 costs more than a base BMW 3 Series.

Still, you're not going to get the Tesla experience anywhere else. The budget-conscious could always choose to hold off on luxe features like Enhanced Autopilot until they feel a bit more secure. Tesla offers standard safety features, like emergency braking, for free.

Other standard features include keyless entry, Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity, voice-activated controls, onboard maps and navigation, and a 12-volt power outlet.

None of this factors in deductions from federal and state tax incentives. Keep in mind that the $7,500 federal tax incentive starts to phase out once an automaker sells 200,000 vehicles domestically — a target Tesla is approaching.

""You may be eligible for local or federal tax incentives when you purchase your Model 3,"" Tesla writes on its webpage. ""We recommend speaking with a tax professional for guidance, as some incentives may depend on your personal tax situation."""

Seven months, three weeks, and three days.

That's how long it's been since my Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S was damaged in an accident, and I still don't have my car back. That's nearly eight months of rather large monthly payments for a car I'm unable to drive; nearly eight months of incrementally higher costs associated with insurance and registration for a car that's sitting in the shop; nearly eight months of having to find and arrange alternative transportation; nearly eight months of having to buy gas again, while the gas savings had previously helped to offset said large monthly payments; nearly eight months of impatiently waiting to get back a car that I absolutely love; and nearly eight months of regularly prodding Tesla for updates with little to no response.

You may assume that my car was involved in some sort of catastrophic collision that would require hours upon hours of labor to repair. Nope. It was a run-of-the-mill accident (more details later). Tesla is predominantly responsible for why it is taking so long, because out of those eight months, over five of them have been spent doing nothing but waiting for parts.

Let me back up a bit and start from the beginning.

Jan. 27, 2016: Delivery day

In late 2015, my wife and I decided to take the plunge and buy a Model S. We had been longtime supporters of, and investors in, the company, first buying shares in 2011. We finally pulled the trigger in December of that year. In order to save quite a bit of money, we opted for a certified pre-owned (CPO) model, which cost about a third less than a comparably equipped new Model S.

At the time, the Colorado state tax credit ($6,000) for electric vehicles could be claimed on used vehicles, provided the car had never been registered in the state. (The state credit was recently amended to exclude used vehicles, effective starting 2017.) So we found one that was located in New Jersey, and even after paying the maximum transportation fee ($1,500), it still easily worked out in our favor. It was less than two years old and had less than 20,000 miles on it -- not bad for what we saved by going CPO. It was even the exact same shade of dark green as my first car, a color option that had since been discontinued -- bonus nostalgia points.

It took about a month for the car to arrive, but we immediately fell in love with it. We started taking road trips more often (within the bounds of the Supercharger network, of course), and frequently found excuses just to drive and enjoy the instant torque.

Like most Tesla customers, we became involuntary but not unwilling advocates for the company, fielding a constant string of questions from friends, family, and strangers regarding how the car worked and what sort of behavioral adjustments one has to make when going all-electric. We also attracted the typical confounded stares when we'd put something in the ""frunk"" or put the kids in the rear-facing seats that we had Tesla retrofit post-delivery.

A couple of months after taking delivery, we placed a reservation for a Model 3 on March 31, the day that Tesla unveiled the vehicle and started taking deposits.

July 11, 2016: Accident day

I was actually at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, when the accident occurred (I worked for Tesla very briefly during the summer of 2016). My wife called me frantically, exasperated that she had been involved in an accident. Most importantly, she was largely unharmed -- just some minor whiplash that she quickly recovered from. She was more concerned that the car had been injured. She had been driving home from work, sitting stationary at a stop light, when a young driver failed to hit the brakes in time and rear-ended the vehicle at a relatively low speed.

Here's the picture I asked her to take of the car immediately after the impact:

It looks worse than it was, in part because the Model S and Model X contain more aluminum than most vehicles. Aluminum crumples much easier than steel, as it's a softer metal. This is also an important safety feature, as the crumple zones are larger and can absorb more impact, with the downside being that aluminum is more expensive. A consequence is that Tesla accidents look really bad because the vehicles get mangled, but the functional benefit is minimal intrusion into the passenger cabin.

Less than six months after we had taken delivery, our Model S was off to the shop.

Nearly eight months later...

While Tesla performs most routine service itself, it outsources major body work to a network of third-party body shops that are certified by Tesla. The certification process is expensive and time-consuming, but certified body shops will garner most of the local business (there is only one certified body shop in my immediate area).

Shortly after receiving my damaged car, the body shop started tearing down the vehicle to assess the damage and ordering the parts that would be necessary for the repair. The vast majority of the repair time has been gobbled up here. I had heard and read stories about Tesla parts taking longer to deliver relative to the rest of the industry, but that's expected for a young car company with just one factory. Anecdotally, stories about waiting two to three months for Tesla to deliver parts are not uncommon. After three months had passed and the body shop had still not received all the necessary parts, we began reaching out to Tesla directly through their customer service channels, which serve as a liaison to the internal parts department.

Initially, no customer service representative that we interacted with was willing to take ownership of our issue. We kept getting passed between representatives with little to no useful information (a customer service manager eventually took ownership of handling our issue after repeated escalations). Parts had started to trickle in, but there still weren't enough to start the repair, so our car continued to sit idly. Two of the more pertinent parts were a rear lift gate and rear quarter panel, which were still outstanding. During one of the escalations in November (four months after the accident), Tesla guaranteed us that all parts would arrive at the body shop no later than the last week of November. They didn't.

In mid-December, the shop finally received enough parts to start working on the car (but not all of them). At that point, the holidays were nearly upon us, and every industry slows down around that time of year. The body shop would begin the repair in early January 2017 after the holidays. There were still a few outstanding parts, including bulb rivets. I would think that something as basic as rivets would be among the easier parts to deliver, but evidently I'm wrong (and not alone). We again contacted customer service, and Tesla again assured us they had just shipped the remaining parts for overnight delivery. Frankly, we didn't have much faith at this point, as we had been told this before. But in the final week of January, the shop confirmed that they had indeed received all remaining parts necessary to complete the repair. It looked like light at the end of the tunnel, six months in. At this point in the story, the car has spent more time in the shop than in our possession.

A couple weeks ago, the body shop updated us that the car was about to enter the paint shop, at which point it should only take a couple more weeks to reassemble the painted pieces and then perform electronics calibrations and a few other outstanding items. It turns out that the 12V battery is also now in need of replacement, as it will no longer hold a charge (perhaps this is related to how long the car has been sitting idle?). The shop ordered the battery a week and a half ago. Tesla uses exactly one specific supplier for its 12V batteries, which is struggling to keep up with Tesla's demands. We're now looking at yet another delay for the 12V battery, which is a part that most people are able to purchase for their vehicles locally within 15 minutes.

As soon as Tesla delivers this battery, the car will be ready within a day or two. It's supposed to be ready this week, but at this point I have incredibly low expectations, as we are again waiting on Tesla to deliver.

Look, Ma: No car!

Tesla is known for having a generous loaner policy when vehicles are being serviced, but sadly this policy does not apply to body work.

The driver that hit us was uninsured, so we had to file our claims through our collision coverage, and we have coverage for a rental. But our rental coverage maxes out at 45 days, which is typically sufficient time for most body repairs. Having already known that our repair would probably take at least two months, I knew we would need to arrange alternative transportation. Even if we opted to use our insurance company's negotiated rental rates, it would cost approximately $1,000 per month to rent a car. That's in addition to the monthly loan payments that we are still paying.

Fortunately, my parents are retired, and as such have little need for their cars. My mother graciously agreed to let me borrow her car as long as needed, which relieved us of having to bleed out a small fortune ($7,000 by now) in rental fees for an indefinite period of time.

What this says about Tesla

This experience has profoundly shaken our faith in Tesla as a company and an investment. Thus far, Tesla has not given us a reason as to why our parts were so severely delayed, so we have no indication as to whether or not this is a one-off exception or if there is some systemic problem within Tesla's parts operations. While we've been waiting, Tesla has delivered tens of thousands of vehicles, including about 29,000 Model S sedans.

Some of Tesla's weakness here is certainly related to its ability to produce parts, which continues to improve every month. Theoretically, parts production should accelerate as Tesla continues to ramp its overall manufacturing capacity. That said, it seems like supply constraints can't be the only problem here. I'm fairly confident that my case is an outlier, but even if it is, it's still disconcerting that situations like this can slip through the cracks after repeated escalations and assurances. We're now questioning our Model 3 reservation, though we have a few months to make up our minds.

Our experience also calls into question Tesla's ability to support its existing customer base, which is a critical indication of whether or not Tesla can support a massively larger customer base. The company is still targeting 500,000 units in 2018. As many analysts and pundits point out, the enthusiastic early adopters may be willing to forgive this sort of thing, but the mainstream is a different story."

Musk is the chairman of SolarCity and the largest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity (Musk is recusing himself from the vote).

While Wall Street has so far panned the deal—sending shares of Tesla (tsla) plummeting—some industry watchers see the two companies as an inevitable pairing, groomed to be joined from the start. Both have tried hard to own their own manufacturing, investing huge amounts building massive factories, and both are focused on the applications of how to use cleaner and more sustainable energy.

Was it always Musk’s intention to merge them? Perhaps. Here are five other things you may not know about Tesla.

1). Tesla Is Constructing One of the World’s Largest Buildings

The huge battery factory will sprawl across 5.8 million square feet, making it one of the largest buildings by footprint anywhere in the world. When completed, the facility is supposed to churn out enough batteries to power 500,000 electric cars per year, which is about the equivalent of the entire world’s lithium-ion battery production.

2). Tesla Is a Tiny Automaker

Despite the amount of attention and headlines that Tesla receives daily, the company still produces a very small volume of cars. Tesla has shipped about 100,000 cars to customers over the course of its lifetime. By comparison, the U.S. auto industry delivered over 17 million cars last year, and it is expected to ship a similar number this year. BMW, Lexus and Mercedes all sold over 340,000 luxury cars in just 2015.

3). Tesla Almost Died a Bunch of Times (And Was Nearly Bought By Google)



In an effort to build an independent electric car company—a feat that no one else has accomplished—Musk has taken some big gambles, some of which haven’t paid off. The company has been on a roller coaster ride throughout its life, which Musk detailed during the company’s annual shareholders meeting recently. Tesla has run through cash and come perilously close to collapse. In 2013, Tesla only had two weeks of cash left after struggling with production of its Model S car, and Musk was close to selling his company to Google, which was co-founded by Larry Page, a Musk pal.

4). Tesla Makes Batteries for Buildings and the Power Grid

Tesla already packages batteries to power its electric cars, but last year Tesla launched a division that packages similar batteries to be used for buildings, homes and the power grid. Connected together in big battery farms, utilities can use Tesla batteries to store solar energy produced during the day to be used at night, or use the batteries to help manage supply and demand of energy on the power grid. Some companies, like this winery in Northern California, are using the batteries to lower their energy bills by shifting their energy usage onto batteries when the cost of grid power goes up.

5). Tesla Already Has Nearly 400,000 Orders for its Model 3

Earlier this year, Tesla opened up reservations for its low cost Model 3 car, which won’t be delivered to customers until late 2017 at the earliest. Despite the long wait time, within a couple weeks of the unveiling of the Model 3, Tesla said almost 400,000 people had put down $1,000 (refundable) reservations for the $35,000 car. Musk called the response “the biggest one-week launch of any product ever.”"

He now sits at the end of the production line at Tesla Motors' factory in Fremont, California, and he's stashed a sleeping bag in a nearby conference room.

He's done this, he said during a conference call with investors, to emphasize how seriously he takes the epic task ahead of him: Building hundreds of thousands of Model 3 sedans each year and selling them at a price the masses will pay, while turning a profit.

The Model 3 is the car Tesla Motors has promised since its founding, the car Musk is convinced will push EVs into the mainstream and change the world. In the five weeks since Tesla revealed the $35,000 sedan, more than 325,000 people have paid $1,000 to reserve a spot in line for the car. Tesla promised to start deliveries by the end of 2017, and to move 500,000 units a year (including Model S and Model X sales) by 2020.

Musk, apparently feeling his company isn't under quite enough pressure, upped the ante during Wednesday's call, saying he'll deliver 100,000 cars by the end of 2017 and hit the half-million threshold in 2018.

It's hard to understate the challenge ahead. Yes, Tesla has enjoyed tremendous success with the Model S, and the Model X is undeniably cool. But that's nickel-and-dime stuff compared to what Musk wants to do with the 3. ""It is an amazing achievement to engineer, build and market 50,000 examples of one model in a hotly competitive global market, as Tesla has done,"" says Jack Nerad, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. ""It is a far more difficult assignment to reach the 500,000-unit sales mark with a multi-vehicle line.""

Hitting the benchmarks Musk outlined demands moving like the old-school automakers Musk so joyously ridicules. Tesla must ramp up capacity, develop a reliable supply chain, and finish the enormous Gigafactory battery plant under construction in the desert east of Reno, Nevada.

No less importantly, Musk must kick his habit of blowing deadlines—although he always makes good on his word, he usually does so two years later than promised—and master the logistics of a market segment that operates on a vast scale and small margins.

The fixed costs of building cars—tooling, materials, labor, and so on—keep the profit margins for cars around $35,000 at around 5 percent. That's half what an automaker usually sees in the luxury segment where Tesla's always played. Earning a profit on the Model 3, which Musk expects to comprise the bulk of sales, requires precise control of every factor.

Recent history isn't encouraging. The Model S has improved with time, but grown ever more expensive. The rollout of the Model X has been riddled with problems, from malfunctioning doors and windows to freezing screens. Tesla sold just 50,580 cars last year, the same number GM moves in a weekend. Meanwhile, production VP Greg Reichow and manufacturing VP Josh Ensign, just bailed. Reichow will stay on until his replacement is found, but losing two key execs just as you're ramping up production is never helpful.

You can kill a fly with a thermonuclear weapon, with a Moab, with a cruise missile, with a machine gun, or with a fly swatter. Elon Musk

From what he says, Musk fully appreciates the challenge, and appears to be doing all right things. ""Tesla is gonna be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on Earth,"" he says. The company is lining up suppliers—Musk claims he's meeting with the manufacturing teams, not just the corporate brass—and ramping up hiring.

Perhaps most importantly, Musk promised to keep the Model 3 as simple as possible. He isn't allowing any design decisions without approval from the manufacturing team. The car will be stylish, sure, but don't expect the needless flourishes or precious design of the Model X. ""You can kill a fly with a thermonuclear weapon, with a Moab, with a cruise missile, with a machine gun, or with a fly swatter,"" he said. The Model X was a nuke. The Model 3 is a fly swatter.

A strained metaphor to be sure, but the point remains: ""We're trying to get as many electric vehicles on the road as possible."" Musk is saying all the right things. Now his company has one year to go from talking to walking, and then another year to start running."

(And Why the Answer Matters),2017-08-16 12:05:30,2019-06-24 14:22:21.988449,,"There’s little argument that Tesla is a wildly innovative company. But is its automotive business a disruptor, poised to transform the entire transportation sector? The answer matters. Investors and lenders are betting on the company’s long-term potential to dominate a future that may feature autonomous vehicles, sustainable energy consumption, and the ability to upgrade easily as both hardware and software evolve. If that potential isn’t realized, the money will quickly dry up. Successful disruption often requires a robust manufacturing, distribution, and service platform that can be repurposed to help scramble the incumbent industry supply chain in short order, as well as a steady supply of revenue from more mature products to fund continued experimentation. It’s not clear that Tesla has those components in place. Elon Musk may succeed in starting a disruptive revolution, only to fade from the field just as incumbents or other new entrants waiting nearby storm the palace.

Tesla, Elon Musk’s automotive start-up, is having a very good year. In September, the company expects to begin shipping its all-electric Model 3 to non-employee customers, who have already logged 500,000 pre-orders. After reporting earnings earlier this month, its stock jumped, rocketing the 14-year-old startup’s valuation to over $53 billion, ahead of every other U.S. car manufacturer and all but three worldwide. This despite the fact that the company lost nearly two billion dollars in the past two years alone.

There’s little argument that Tesla is a wildly innovative company. But is its automotive business a disruptor, poised to transform the entire transportation sector? That’s the question that has dogged the company from the beginning, inspiring heated debate among Wall Street analysts, fanatical customers, and tech-related online communities. Musk himself is ambivalent about the term. “I’m much more inclined to say, ‘How can we make things better?’” he said recently.

The answer matters. The company is currently almost $10 billion in debt, and on Monday last week Tesla announced plans to borrow an additional $1.5 billion to escape what Musk calls the “manufacturing hell” the company is now experiencing in its transition from small batch car making to mass production. Investors and lenders are betting on the company’s long-term potential to dominate a future that may feature autonomous vehicles, sustainable energy consumption, and the ability to upgrade easily as both hardware and software evolve. If that potential isn’t realized, the money will quickly dry up.

Tesla clearly doesn’t qualify under the traditional definition of a disruptive innovation. In the model described by Clayton Christensen, a new entrant offers substitute products using technology that is cheaper but initially inferior to products offered by mature incumbents. Then the disruptor improves its performance over time, eventually catching the industry either unaware or unable to adapt.

In our continuing work on Big Bang Disruption, we have noted several alternative paths to industry transformation. These include offering a more expensive product whose superiority shifts consumer buying patterns, a “blue ocean” alternative that redefines consumer expectations to create new market space, and a long period of growing revenue but shrinking profits that lead to industry collapse and reincarnation based on a new value proposition.

Finally, there is Big Bang Disruption itself, where rapid evolution of new technologies leads to the introduction of substitute products that are both better and cheaper right from the beginning, triggering a sudden abandonment of consumers away from incumbents to the new entrants who best utilize the capabilities and changing economics of the disruptive tech.

But no matter which definition you use, it’s hard to see Tesla fitting it.

For one thing, it’s not clear what disruptive technology the company is offering. Electric cars have been around for a long time (Tesla has been selling them for almost a decade), but the technology is still neither better nor cheaper than internal combustion. According to Tesla’s own data, battery density doesn’t exhibit the kind of growth that has driven exponential improvements in digital technology. Battery performance may not reach parity with fossil fuels for another 50 years.

Ditto for autonomous vehicles, and for Tesla’s promise of fully-automated manufacturing based on improvements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and other disruptors. Tesla may find a disruptive solution using some or all of these technologies, but they haven’t yet.

In the meantime, of course, there’s no guarantee that Tesla will be the winner in any automotive technology arms race. Most major car companies are now investing heavily in the same technologies, and in some cases may be using the same component suppliers as Tesla. Tesla famously open-sourced all its patents in 2014, reducing any advantage the company may otherwise have claimed for proprietary inventions.

For now, what the company has is a powerful brand that stands for luxury and sustainability at the same time. But it’s not hard to see any number of existing premium brands—think BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Lexus—stepping in to claim the same mantle.

Still, Tesla boosters compare the company to Apple, and on the surface the similarities are compelling. Both companies were led by visionaries, both offer high-end versions of commodity products, and both enjoy fierce loyalty from customers.

But the competitively-priced Model 3 is not the iPhone, which in 2007 radically reinvented cell phones, personal digital assistants, digital cameras, and several other disparate products in one remarkable leap. (At the time, one of the premium mobile devices was a Blackberry.) And Apple, unlike Tesla, had the capacity to make millions of the new devices right from the start, along with strong distribution, retail, and repair channels.

Tesla is also not comparable to Netflix, another frequently-cited example of a disruptive innovator. Netflix disrupted the video rental market at least twice—first with its DVD mailing service and then, in 2007, with its streaming Internet-based service, which clearly met the better and cheaper criteria for a true Big Bang Disruption. Consumers jumped en masse, destroying Blockbuster and other retail rental chains in just a few years. Tesla’s current battery technologies are not both better and cheaper than existing internal combustion. Even if they were, it would not be realistic to expect customers to replace vehicle hardware as quickly as they change their media-consumption habits.

The better analog for Tesla may be the Sony Librie and other early electronic book readers, introduced at great expense and fanfare between 1998 and 2006. None of them succeeded. Then Amazon launched the Kindle in 2007, at last igniting transformation of the sluggish book business.

Amazon’s disruptive insight was that component technologies had finally matured, including displays, storage, lightweight batteries, and cellular networks that could be used to upload and download new content. Amazon also leveraged its growing strength in the publishing supply chain as well as a reputation for superior customer service to create and dominate the e-book business, dispatching prior and future competitors.

As these examples suggest, successful disruption often requires a robust manufacturing, distribution, and service platform that can be repurposed to help scramble the incumbent industry supply chain in short order, as well as a steady supply of revenue from more mature products to fund continued experimentation.

For now, Tesla has none of these. Worse, the company is subject to considerable uncertainty over substantial government subsidies, which in some markets have had a profound influence on the willingness of consumers to pay Tesla’s premium price. In Hong Kong and Denmark, for example, announcements that the subsidy would be withdrawn collapsed Tesla sales by 90% or more, leading Danish officials to extend the rebate period.

Assuming the company can overcome its “manufacturing hell,” Tesla may well deliver all the 500,000 pre-ordered Model 3s by the end of 2018. But as Apple learned from the muted success of the iWatch, early enthusiasm for a new product may not suggest a long tail of future sales. After announcing the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla signed up the first 300,000 customers in just two weeks, most in less than a week. But as with smart watches, the increasingly frictionless spread of product preferences among consumers may mean that nearly all likely customers showed up at once, at product launch.

For the cash-strapped Tesla, waning sales may cut short any hopes of securing a sustainable leadership position in a reinvented transportation industry. Elon Musk may succeed in starting a disruptive revolution, only to fade from the field just as incumbents or other new entrants waiting nearby storm the palace.

Thomson Reuters Over the past few years, as its sales and stock have risen, Tesla's core business model has been shifting.

The carmaker was founded in 2003 with the basic goal of bringing an exciting all-electric vehicle to market. It succeeded, and under CEO Elon Musk (who started out as just an investor) the company has grown to sell nearly 100,000 vehicles a year, the newest of which are equipped with semi-self-driving technology.

To drive this growth, Tesla also invested in a far-flung network of fast-charging stations.

About a year after the launch of the Model S sedan in 2013, Tesla's business plan began to undergo modifications. An energy-storage business was launched, and in 2016, Tesla merged with SolarCity. The first Tesla solar product, the Solar Roof, officially went on sale last week. Meanwhile, Tesla continued to build a massive battery factory in Nevada.

There are useful connections and synergies among these various businesses, and they both fit with and enable Musk's master vision for a fossil-fuel-free world.

Unfortunately for Tesla, though, the company could be playing a transitional role in the broad disruption of traditional mobility than many analysts and experts now think is underway.

Tesla is the bridge

Tesla's surging market cap. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider

In this story, Tesla is an innovator that proved it was possible to start a new car company after the globe hadn't really seen one for decades; Tesla also revived the electric car, which had languished for a century after losing out to the internal-combustion engine.

Tesla is a bridge between the old ways and the news ways, with a foot in each camp — and potentially the inability to prosper in the new world that it made possible. Remember that once you've crossed a bridge, you don't need it anymore. It's in the past.

In a research note published Monday downgrading Tesla to ""equal-weight"" from ""overweight,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas argued that competition will soon arrive for Tesla, but that the competition might not look like what everyone thinks it would be:

Internet of Cars (IOC) is an addressable market we estimate to exceed $10 trillion today plus the value of more than 600 billion human hours spent inside cars annually (10 trillion miles/25mph x 1.55 occupancy). IOC is too big and too complementary to harvesting and analyzing data for the world's most valuable firms to ignore. As such, we expect the next few months and years to reveal a number of catalysts that show with little ambiguity that there are some very big technological and commercial bets being made right in Tesla's backyard. If investors are prepared to give Tesla credit for some meaningful degree of success (however small) in these markets, they must also be prepared to share the road with others.

What Jonas leaves unspoken is the emerging idea that replacing the traditional automobile with something better is rapidly being supplanted by the notion than physical transportation is far less lucrative than the activity of passengers inside the vehicles.

Silicon Valley getting out of cars

Is Tesla in trouble? Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider

""Big tech companies have gone cold on being assemblers,"" Ewen Cameron Watt, a Senior Adviser at Blackrock, said in an interview.

""They want to be data managers. It's all about the data and connectivity,"" Cameron, who is also the co-author of a study from the Blackrock Investment Institute titled ""Future of the vehicle - Winners and losers: from cars and cameras to chips.""

Tesla isn't ignoring this opportunity — machine learning from its fleet of Autopilot-enabled vehicles is serving up a massive amount of real-world information about self-driving technology. But Tesla is also trying to do several things at once, just when it comes to the auto side of its business.

It's trying to produce and sell big-ticket luxury cars, service them, launch a cheaper vehicle, and provide widespread fast-charging. Forget adding semis and pickup trucks to the mix, as Musk has said Tesla will — executing on just one of its existing challenges would be impressive.

However, Tesla's traditional competitors are already good at all those things, while Tesla's tech rivals now appear uninterested in replicating Tesla's experience.

Narrative vulnerability

In response, Tesla is trying to exploit the elasticity of its business model, which may or may not be there to exploit. Thus far, developing new lines of business hasn't hurt Tesla, but the company's historic financial underperformance has been masked by a surging stock price and the company's ability to access the capital markets for billions in ongoing funding, despite the carmaker being 13 years old, with an IPO staged in 2010.

Tesla's vulnerability is unique: I call it ""narrative vulnerability."" Electric cars are yesterday's story. The new story is about self-driving systems and Big Data.

The problem with narrative vulnerability is that once it takes hold, Tesla's only way to deal with is to adjust its story. Tesla has been able to do that, up to a point. But at some point, the features of its new story won't fit with a very different narrative.

The critical issue is that Tesla will always be tied to cars: designing them, building them, selling them. In that respect, it could wind up a victim of its spectacular success.

The service is unnamed, but we're going to suggest ""Tesla Tunes"" over ""Tesla Music.""

Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Tesla officially became a mass-market automaker this month, as it rolled the first Model 3 vehicle off its California assembly line.

The $35,000 Model 3 was designed to open up Tesla ownership to a much wider range of people than the relatively expensive Model S and Model X.

New Tesla owners will quickly discover than electric cars have one major difference from gas-powered vehicles: they have to be charged up. The Model 3 has a range of 200 miles, superb for an EV, but it will need to be rejuiced, and if you're used to refueling in five minutes, EV ownership required some advance planning and behavioral changes.

Fortunately, Tesla operates a network of Superchargers that make longer trips possible (the automaker asks owner to do their everyday charging at home). The company has also worked with partners to install even more charging locations that offer slower charging than what's available at Sueprchargers but provide a gap-filling fallback.

I've spent a lot of time driving EVs. In 2015, I drove one of my kids to camp in a BMW i3, an extended-range electric vehicle that at the time was rumored to be a basis for the Apple Car.

The trip went great, so last year I decided to make our annual camp sojourn to the scenic Catskills in upstate New York a regular EV-paloooza. And what better car to serve as our futuristic chariot in 2016 than ... the Tesla Model S?

And not just any Model S, but a P90D with Ludicrous Mode — at the time the baddest, fastest, coolest Tesla in all the land (until the P100D arrived in early 2017.)

The idea was to see if this four-door luxury ""family car"" with supercar-beating acceleration — zero to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds, claimed — could handle a journey of decent length (about 240 miles round trip) involving two adults, three kids, and gear for a pair of campers for two weeks. Quite a test, eh? And with a few scheduled stops to dine, take in the sights, and recharge the battery.

Hundreds of other SUV models have been given five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But in each case, the SUV received only four stars on one of the component ratings, typically rollover risk. SUVs have a higher center of gravity and are more prone to roll over than a typical family sedan.

But the electric-powered Model X has a heavy lithium battery pack on the bottom of the car that provides the power, and thus has a much lower center of gravity than the typical SUV. So it was the first in its class to get five stars across the board.

Besides assessing the risk of a rollover, NHTSA, the federal safety regulator, tests how safe a car is in a head-on collision, in a side collision and skidding into a pole or a tree on its side.

Tesla said those tests found that people inside a Model X have a 93% chance of walking away from an accident without serious injury, which it said would be the second highest on record, behind only the Tesla Model S. NHTSA has not released stats to the public beyond the five-star rating system.

This is the first time NHTSA has tested the Model X, the first SUV produced by Tesla (TSLA). It went on sale in late 2015, although Tesla didn't reach full production until last year. It is known for its distinctive falcon-wing doors, which are hinged on top and open vertically rather than swinging open like a typical car door.

That makes logo design a very important task.

Tesla’s logo is certainly not anonymous, but it turns out there’s more to it than may be immediately apparent.

What looks like simply a stylized “T” is actually a reference to the company’s products, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a recent tweet (via Motor1).

The Tesla logo is intended to represent the cross-section of an electric motor, Musk explained to a querying Twitter follower.

Musk seemed to be referring to the main body of the “T” as representing one of the poles that stick out of a motor’s rotor, with the second line on top representing a section of the stator.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke

Repeating the Tesla logo in a circle, with the top of each “T” facing outward, does indeed create a reasonable facsimile of an electric-motor cross-section. (Motor architectures can vary considerably, so take this as a simplified explanation.)

In this respect, it matches the logo of SpaceX, another of Musk’s ventures—which in this case designs and builds rockets, and contracts to send payloads into orbit.

The stylized “X” in the SpaceX logo is meant to represent a rocket trajectory, Musk said in his tweets.

Both logos were designed by RO-Studio, a design firm based in New Jersey.

Compared to those of Tesla and SpaceX, the logo of Musk’s third major venture is relatively straightforward.

SolarCity’s logo includes a sun graphic, representing the power source for the company’s solar panels.

Musk negotiated Tesla’s purchase of SolarCity last year, citing anticipated synergies between solar energy and Tesla’s energy-storage battery business.

SolarCity was previously controlled by Musk and members of his family, but had been a separate corporate entity from Tesla.

The SolarCity acquisition is the latest indication that Musk views Tesla as more than just an automaker.

Recently, the company officially re-branded itself as simply “Tesla Inc.,” rather than the previous “Tesla Motors.”

Last year, it acquired the rights to the domain name “Tesla.com” after roughly 10 years of trying, and has since adopted it as the domain for its website.

Tesla struck a deal with Liberty Mutual to create a customized insurance package — and the move shows how the electric automaker is intent on disrupting the insurance industry.

The new plan is called InsureMyTesla and was designed specifically for Tesla vehicles. Its benefits include replacing Teslas damaged beyond repair within one year. Tesla launched the package on October 13 in the US in all 50 states, but it already exists in 20 other countries, a company representative confirmed.

Electrek first reported on the news.

Tesla started quietly rolling out the InsureMyTesla program in February in Hong Kong and Australia. The electric car maker partners with different insurance companies across the globe to offer InsureMyTesla, which lowers overall insurance costs by factoring in the vehicles' Autopilot safety features and maintenance costs.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that insurance agencies should adjust their prices for Tesla vehicles because the cars come with Autopilot, the company's advanced driver-assistance feature.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crash rates for Tesla vehicles have plummeted 40% since Autopilot was first installed. Electric vehicles also generally require less maintenance then traditional, gas-powered vehicles.

""If we find that the insurance providers are not matching the insurance proportionate to the risk of the car then if we need to we will in-source it,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in February.

Tesla's partnership with Liberty Mutual marks the first time the InsureMyTesla package has been available in the US. The US launch comes a few months after AAA said it would raise rates for Tesla owners after seeing a high frequency of claims among Model S and Model X owners.

AAA based its decision based on data provided by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an analysis that a Tesla spokesperson said was "" severely flawed"" at the time.

The deal with Liberty Mutual shows how US agencies are starting to realize that they must adjust their prices as cars get safer with advents in self-driving tech.

Insurers like Cincinnati Financial, Mercury General, and Travelers have noted in SEC filings that driverless cars could threaten their business models, according to a 2015 Bank of America and Merrill Lynch report.

The personal auto insurance sector could shrink to 40% of its current size within 25 years as cars become safer with autonomous tech, according to a report by the global accounting firm KPMG.

Tesla hopes to one day bundle the price of insurance and maintenance into the price of future vehicles.

""It takes into account not only the Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance cost of the car,"" Jon McNeill, Tesla's vice president of sales and services, has said of InsureMyTesla. ""It's our vision in the future we could offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance."""

Founder Klaus Grohmann will also be joining Tesla and will head a new division within the automaker called Tesla Advanced Automation Germany.

Tesla plans to add an additional 1,000 engineering and technician jobs in Germany, on top of Grohmann’s existing 700 employees, over the next two years as the company looks to aggressively ramp up electrical vehicle production at its Fremont, California factory. Tesla has said it wants to increase production from around 80,000 cars in 2016 to 500,000 cars in 2018. Its more affordable Model 3 EV is expected to begin production late this year.

This is the first “significant” acquisition in Tesla’s history, said Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

“Because automation is such a vital part of the future of Tesla, the phrase I’ve used before is that it’s about building the machine that’s building the machine,” said Musk on a call with journalists this morning. “That actually becomes more important than the machine itself as the volume increases. We think it’s important to bring in world-class engineering talent and our first choice was Grohmann.”

“It’s about building the machine that’s building the machine.”

Tesla and Grohmann have been working together for more than a year and the acquisition came out of a mutual desire for the firms to work together even more closely. Grohmann works with a number of other automotive manufacturers, as well as semiconductor and life-science companies, and the company will continue to work with outside clients, including those in the automotive industry.

“Companies are people, and we’re very honored that [founder Klaus Grohmann] will be staying on,” said Musk. “That makes a big difference.”

Tesla CTO JB Straubel said the pool of engineering talent in Germany is significant and that drove the decision to invest in Germany and expand the Grohmann team post-acquisition.

A number of elements of Tesla’s automated manufacturing systems will be designed in-house by the Advanced Automation team in Prüm, Germany, and the company believes it will deliver “exponential improvements in the speed and quality of production” as it works to increase vehicle production ahead of the Model 3 launch.

Tesla has increased its vehicle production by 400 percent over the past four years, but it will need to increase production four-fold over the next two years if it expects to hit its production goals. Musk said his company is also in the early stages of planning a combined battery and vehicle factory — a “Gigafactory 2” — to be located in Europe.

Acquisition price was not disclosed, but the deal is expected to close by early 2017."

It was unfashionably late and the first cars to roll off the assembly line were riddled with problems, but none of that stopped the thing from being a car that put the industry on notice, gathering a lot of attention from a lot of people who generally couldn't care less about cars -- especially SUVs.

But the Model X isn't just an SUV. It's an electric SUV, of course, but it's a lot more than that, too. It's quicker than most sports cars on the road, yet far more practical and more comfortable. It offers a selection of luxury appointments rarely found on cars not costing well into the six figures and it manages to fit three rows of seats in a distinctive shape in a segment full of me-too crossovers.

The Model X is an interesting proposition, but now in its second year of full production, is it still the car of the future it was in 2016?

What's new

If you read my full review of the Model X last year you could probably tell that I enjoyed the thing but left feeling a bit conflicted about a few aspects. While this is still very much the same car as last year, a few significant updates for 2017 do move it forward in some key areas.

The first is practicality. While the middle-row seats in the initial Model X looked majestic on their pedestals as they moved serenely forward and back, they were way too damn slow in exposing the third row and, worse, they didn't fold flat.

Now, buyers have a few different middle-row configurations to ponder, with room for either six or seven. Crucially, that middle row now folds flat. It's still too slow to get out of the way and provide access to the back, but baby steps.

Additionally, the Model X now uses Tesla's new synthetic covering on all seats rather than the animal hide of yore. While some purists may scoff at this, I assure you this ain't your typical bargain bin pleather. I was surprised to really like the feel of the stuff, and those with ethical concerns about such things can feel a little better about their purchase.

Another improvement comes in range. Tesla now offers a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack option, which gives a realistic 295 miles of range. That's up about 40 miles over last year, and to be honest even that figure felt like plenty. But, while the car didn't need more range, a little more comfort room never hurt.

The Model X didn't need to be any faster, either, but that didn't stop Tesla from making it so. The top-shelf P100D will sprint from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds, up two-tenths from last year's quickest. That's frankly ridiculous for any object that weighs 5,500 pounds, but I love it.

The final big change? Autopilot, and I'm sorry to report that it's not all good news there. Tesla's shifted the Model X to the second-generation of Autopilot, called AP2, and has been working hard to bring this new system up to the same level as the previous. And, on the highway, it definitely is. In my testing on major roads the Model X smoothly and cleanly stayed centered within its lane, speeding up and slowing down to keep with traffic, changing lanes on its own with a touch of the turn stalk, even coming to a complete stop in gridlock.

It's off the highway where things still need work. Last year, the Model X was nervous at times but felt pretty competent at identifying lanes on secondary roads and steering itself around. Now, the car feels jittery and unpredictable, frequently getting confused at junctions or anything more than a very gradual turn.

On the highway, AP2 is a blessing and takes a lot of the tedium out of long drives, especially long traffic jams, but as soon as you find your exit I recommend leaving it off. It's just not ready for prime time.

Living with one

I tested a Model X for a week, covering hundreds of miles on highways and byways, and since just about everyone asked me how far it'll go on a charge, I'll start there.

The Model X 100D will go up to 295 miles on a charge, but if you opt for the higher-performance P100D that drops slightly to 289. And that's not a number that only a semi-drafting, AC-avoiding hypermiler has any chance of hitting. That's a realistic figure, and while I never got that far on a single charge, I came pretty close -- despite numerous uses of the Model X's Ludicrous mode.

When set to maximum power mode, the Model X is pretty astonishing. The acceleration is brutal and the throttle response instantaneous, but the real beauty is just how accessible it is. Any speed, any time, just dip your right foot slightly and you'll quickly be surveying the depths of the padding of the car's headrests. And, while some will lament the lack of a snarling engine note to go along with it, that does mean you can be a little more liberal with the throttle without waking the neighbors.

That you can take up to six other people along with you to experience this acceleration helps, too. Seating in the way back is still best reserved for those very short of stature, but the new second row is still plenty comfortable, and the front seats are great. Every spot in the Model X is heated, useful for chilly mornings, but somehow ventilation is still missing. In a car that breaks $100,000 with just a few options, that feels like an increasingly major oversight.

The dashboard, too, is in need of a refresh. Tesla's big, vertical touchscreen was groundbreaking when we first saw it on the Model S and the concept is still sound, but the performance here is definitely lacking. It feels like the system is trying to do too much with too few processor cycles, and the absence of both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is a curious thing for an infotainment system that was once so progressive.

Finally, there are the doors. The falcon-wing units at the rear of the car do feel slightly faster than they were on the car I tested last year, but they're still plenty slow enough to be annoying. More problematic: They won't open in my garage. And yes, while you can use the Tesla app to wirelessly summon the car to pull out of the garage and open the doors, the whole point of owning a garage is so that I don't have to walk through the rain or snow in the morning.

Tim Stevens/Roadshow

How I'd spec mine

The Model X in its most basic trim, the 75D, starts at $79,500. For that you get a significant 237 miles of range and a zero-to-60 time under five seconds. That's nothing to scoff at, but while I'm typically a practical, frugal shopper, I say that if you're going to go big, you should go big.

I'd at least go for the 100D model, which starts at $99,500, though I'm not sure I could quite stomach the bump up to $145,000 for the P100D. Despite its foibles, I'd go for $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package, but would skip the extra $3,000 for theoretical future self-driving. And, I'd probably bite the bullet for the $6,000 premium package, which is required to get those heated seats.

The car you see pictured here was a fully spec'd P100D with just about every option. The sticker price? $177,000. Not cheap, but just look at the competition

Competition

So what do you pit the Model X against? Well... that's actually pretty tough. There are plenty of three-row luxury SUVs on the market in a similar price range, and you can for example get yourself into a lovely new Land Rover Velar for similar money. But, that of course burns gas and won't get you about town nearly as quickly. It will, however, fare much better off-road. It also looks a fair bit sexier in my book, too.

To match the performance here you have to step up to something like a Bentley Bentayga, but for that you're looking at spending at least $230,000.

And, that's... about it. The Model X really is in a bit of a class of its own.

Tim Stevens/Roadshow

Wrap-up

The Model X is not a perfect car. AP2 still needs work, the infotainment system feels curiously dated and I still hate those falcon-wing doors. But the improvements in range, performance and overall quality of the car mean I have far fewer reservations recommending it than I did in 2016.

A year later, there's still nothing like the Model X on the road. Driving it feels like driving the future, and while it's not for everybody, if it's for you you're in for a pretty special experience."

In a note to investors on Friday, Sacconaghi relates his own less-than-stellar experience buying a Tesla (tsla) Model X. He said it was hard to get information even about his cars delivery date and noted an overall lack of hand holding that is perhaps inherent to Tesla’s direct sales approach. Other car makers field networks of dealerships and service facilities to deal with customers from pre-sales inquiries to service calls, to re-sale.

Overall, his buying experience, which took two years from deposit to taking getting the car, was “not good,” especially compared to what he’s seen from other luxury car makers like BMW and Mercedes. Tesla service centers are relatively scarce. The Tesla web site lists 68 service centers in the U.S. now, with five more “coming soon.”

Related: An analyst’s view of Tesla

A Tesla owner living Silicon Valley is probably fine—nine of those 68 service centers are clustered around San Francisco. But if you’re in upstate New York, you’ll need to schlep to Brooklyn, Syosset, Long Island, Westchester County, or Paramus, N.J. That could be a very long trip. And if there is a major recall-worthy problem with a model, how fast can this limited number of outlets respond?

Fortune contacted Tesla for comment and will update this story as needed.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Sacconaghi conceded that he is basing his note on an extremely limited sample size—himself. But considering the upcoming release of Tesla’s new Model 3, investors should keep an eye on these problems. The Model 3 sedan, is due later this year, has been touted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a smaller, less expensive version of the Model S. Pricing starts at $35,000 compared to $68,000 for the Model S.

Related: Here’s What Elon Musk Shared About the Tesla Model 3

If the lower price boosts sales as expected, current service problems could worsen, according to Sacconaghi.

Related: Why Tesla Could Become the Next Apple

Summing up, he wrote:

“We believe that any shortfalls in Tesla’s customer experience for Model 3 could have significant impact on its powerful brand, potentially resulting in order cancellations and undermining its high customer satisfaction.”

Sacconaghi, who started covering Tesla in March, is a respected tech analyst known for doing his homework and pulling no punches in his coverage of tech giants including Hewlett-Packard [fortune-stock symbol=”hpq”], IBM (ibm), and Apple (aapl). He’s not one of the “great quarter, guys” analysts who lob softballs chief financial officers during earnings calls, which is why investors should pay attention to what he thinks about Tesla."

Complete with a whopping 7,376 pound-feet (10,000 Newton-meters) of torque, it has the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) 1.9 seconds, and continue on to a top speed of 250 mph (402 kmh). Allegedly. But those numbers may be seriously overstated, according to a revealing new video by the folks at Engineering Explained.

According to Jason Fenske of Engineering Explained, he claims that the Tesla Roadster's proposed torque figures are not in-line with typical vehicle performance measurement standards. By his calculations, the supercar is only able to produce 758 lb-ft (1,027 Nm) of torque, and nearly 1,000 hp (745 kW). Still impressive by modern supercar standards, but a far cry from the alleged 7,376 lb-ft (10,000 Nm) the company touted at launch.

The key distinction comes courtesy of the Tesla website, which lists 10,000 Nm of ""wheel torque."" According to Fenske, that number is accurate, but significantly different than the auto industry’s standard measure of engine torque. His calculations lead to the downgraded figure noted above.

Comparatively, Fenske also takes a look at the Dodge Demon, which produces 840 hp (626 kW) and 770 lb-ft (1,043 Nm) of torque, according to Dodge. By multiplying engine torque by gear ratio and final drive, Fenske was able to conclude that the muscle car produces 14,000 Nm (10,325 lb-ft) of wheel torque in first gear – even more torque than Tesla’s 10,000 Nm claim.

The eight-minute video, which breaks down the Tesla Roadster's torque figure and gives us a more detailed explanation as to how the company came to that conclusion, is well worthy of a watch. Check it out above.

Tesla added a new Easter Egg (a goofy software gag generally slightly hidden from view) to its vehicles with the 8.1 update, and this time it’s a sketch pad. The 17-inch touchscreen that dominates the Tesla Model S center panel is basically already a huge digital surface primed for drawing, so it’s a natural add-on – not counting that most of the time you’re going to be using the screen while driving, of course.

Above, you can see Twitter user and Canadian Tesla owner Nik Jovanovic using the new Easter Egg virtual easel in his car. The choice of subject is excellent, depicting the true power source of the Tesla Model S, and it clearly impressed Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO tweeted this image, along with a rudimentary Mona Lisa, when he revealed the nature of the new Easter Egg himself.

I really do love drawing, and I was saving up for a $3,000 Surface Studio to help indulge that hobby. Maybe I’ll just save up an additional $97,000 or so and get a Tesla instead, since I also like driving –two birds, one stone."

OnInnovation/Flickr So far this year, Tesla has revealed two big surprises for its forthcoming Model 3, a $35,000 mass-market electric vehicle that will serve up 200 miles of range on a single charge.

The Tesla-for-the-rest-of-us will likely be launched in July, ahead of schedule. That's surprise number one.

Surprise number two is that Tesla intends to bypass the manufacturing prototype stage and go straight to full production, rolling cars off the assembly line and into customers' driveways.

""Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams,"" Reuters reported.

""Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September.""

CEO Elon Musk's goal is to ramp Model 3 production to 5,000 vehicles per week later in 2017 and then to 10,000 per week sometime in 2018. The run-rate of 10,000 would give Tesla a yearly Model 3 production of 500,000-plus vehicles, when the Model S and Model X are added in.

But even if Tesla doesn't hit it's lofty goal of producing 500,000 vehicles in 2018, if nothing goes wrong, it could achieve half a million cars a little later by 2019

For Tesla to achieve this, though, it's critical that nothing goes wrong.

The big risk

Tesla skipping the manufacturing prototype stage and going straight to full production is risky because something has usually gone wrong with Tesla's vehicles. There were early production challenges with the Model S when it launched in 2013, and after the overly complicated Model X arrived in 2015, Musk admitted to spending the first half of 2016 in production hell.

With a track record like that, Musk pushing his luck with the Model 3 seems like tempting fate.

But he doesn't have a choice.

Launching the Model 3 in a few months shouldn't be a huge issue. The concept version of the car we saw in early 2016 will probably translate into the production vehicle. And lately Tesla has been at pains to manage excessive expectations for the 3, which will be a smaller, cheaper, slower, less luxurious vehicle than the Model S.

What will be a big deal is Tesla going from relatively boutique production to satisfying the 400,000 pre-orders it has racked-up for the Model 3. In Musk's mind, Tesla can't wait another six to 12 months figuring out how to build a high-quality car with efficient pace.

The calculation is likely that the first batch of Model 3 owners will be tolerant of glitches and flaws — they're, in effect, beta-testers of the car — and that only when the more exacting owners start getting their Model 3s will Tesla have to worry.

In the meantime, the company will simply fix everything that goes wrong. For the earliest Model 3 owners, the implicit warranty is going to be the best in the history of the auto industry.

But it's all a short-term gain for a long-term loss. Technology companies are comfortable ""shipping"" buggy software, assuming that if it's good enough, users won't rebel and the problems can be fixed on the fly. That ""shipping"" lingo has begun to invade the car-of-the-future space, as people now speculate on Apple someday ""shipping"" a vehicle just like it ships iPhones.

I've talked to a few people in the auto industry about Tesla generally in the past few months and the company's decision to skip prototyping has come up a few times. They think it's a dangerous bet.

I did it my way

Now, more than ever, Musk is defying the accepted, traditional ways of auto manufacturing.

For example, he also just revealed that he intends to build Tesla Model Y SUV on a different platform from the Model 3— a shocker given that everyone expected the two vehicles to share an architecture. Musk's rationale is that he wants to use the Y to reinvent the manufacturing process, bringing a much higher level of automation into the picture.

Bear in mind that if Tesla successfully launches Model 3 production by July, the markets will probably serve up another Tesla rally, possibly one that rivals the beginning of 2017 when Tesla added $20 billion in market cap and displaced Ford as the number two US automaker.

This better work. Reuters/Bobby Yip; Business Insider/Dave Smith

A large gap between launch and true volume production could engender investor skepticism and reduce the amount of money Tesla can raise from the capital markets. That would be bad because Tesla expects to spend somewhere between $2 billion-$2.5 billion to launch the Model 3 this year, but the company is also going to have to spend billions to construct Musk's Model Y robot factory and will undoubtedly need to do additional fundraises over the next few years.

So again, Musk finds himself backed into a corner. Tesla needs to execute. So he's going to sacrifice some potential goodwill to make the company execute faster.

Can he get away with it? Actually, yes. But he's probably also counting on the Model 3 manufacturing process, by virtue of its simplicity relative to S and X, to generate fewer challenges overall. The looming disaster with that idea is that Tesla has never tried to build this many cars before.

As a result, if there's a cascade of small problems, and maybe a few big ones, the design of the production system could fail catastrophically and Tesla won't be building 5,000 Model 3's per week in 2018 — it will be building zero Model 3's and devoting resources to fixing a mess, in turn undermining Model X and Model S production.

But Musk is a gambler. He thinks he now holds a winning hand and is prepared to press. And to his credit, if he's going to press, now is the time, with Tesla riding high in the minds of investors. The wildcard is the new Tesla customers who could find that the Model 3 they've been waiting for isn't the incredible car they hoped for."

Her Work Has Been Featured Usa Today + Yahoo Finance + The Los Angeles Times.,"Now that Tesla is slowly fulfilling orders for its mythical Model 3, car enthusiasts are clamoring for more information.

Tesla’s newest electric baby is minimalist, powerful and affordable — yes, only $35,000, before upgrades. But so far, the company has released only a few hundred Model 3s and little in the way of details.

Here’s what we currently know about the latest Tesla.

How can I get one?

Get in line. Unless you’re one of the approximately 500,000 people on the waiting list, you can’t buy a Model 3 anytime soon. Priority is given to Tesla employees and owners. Then deliveries will be based on when you placed a reservation.

Pony up. Deposit $1,000 to snag a spot on the Model 3 waiting list, and Tesla will email you when it’s time to place your order.

Be patient. Delivery is currently taking 12 to 18 months. Model 3 reservations placed today are not expected to be delivered until late 2018, at the earliest.

But make sure you really want one. It can take over a year to place an order and get your new ride. There’s plenty of time to change your mind, but some have reported a long, difficult refund process after canceling their orders.

What versions are there?

Long range. Tesla is starting Model 3 production with the expensive ones: the long-range battery configuration with rear-wheel drive and premium upgrades, starting at $49,000.

Base model. The $35,000 Model 3 is on its way. Tesla expects its base-price model, with standard equipment, to be available in November 2017.

Dual motor AWD. Dual motor, all-wheel-drive Model 3s won’t arrive until next year.

What are the standard Model 3 specs?

Price. The standard-battery Model 3 base price is $35,000. The long-range battery version is $44,000 (without premium upgrades).

Color. Black is the only standard color. Other colors are an additional $1,000.

Body. The Model 3 looks like a more compact Model S, with a shorter snout. It’s 184.8 inches long, compared with the 196-inch Model S. The trunk has 15 cubic feet of cargo space, half the volume of the S.

Performance. The Model 3 can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. That’s no small potatoes, but it is the slowest of the Teslas.

Range. The standard-battery Model 3 will achieve 220 miles of range, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk hopes to extend that. The long-range version is said to reach 310 miles.

Top speed. The base model’s top speed is 130 mph, compared with 140 mph for the long-range. “ The standard-battery Model 3 will achieve 220 miles of range, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk hopes to extend that. ”

What about features and upgrades?

Convenience tech. Technology features include keyless entry, a 15-inch touch-screen display, voice-activated controls and Wi-Fi and LTE internet connectivity.

Safety tech. Every Model 3 will have automatic braking and collision avoidance — up-to-date, though not groundbreaking, safety technology.

Premium upgrades. You may want to splurge on the interior and other extras. Premium upgrades are an extra $5,000 (though upgrade prices aren’t yet listed on Tesla’s site). The package includes heated seats, wood trim, a more powerful audio system and power-folding, auto-dimming side mirrors, among other perks.

Enhanced autopilot. For $5,000, this upgrade enables you to maintain speed in traffic, self-park and automatically change lanes.

Self-driving capability. At some point in the future, Tesla cars will be able to not just take the wheel now and then, but also conduct entire trips without any driver input, Musk says. All new Teslas will come with hardware to enable self-driving, but activating this is extra. To get this feature down the road — whenever it becomes available through software updates — you’ll need to fork over an additional $3,000 and must have the enhanced autopilot option."

The plan outlines Musk's vision for a combined Tesla and SolarCity, which Tesla offered to acquire last month. Musk expects that deal to receive investor support.

Tesla plans to focus on selling integrated energy generation and storage, an expansion into other forms of ground transportation like trucks and buses, as well as autonomous driving technology. Finally, Tesla is looking to allow owners of its cars to share their vehicles with others in order to have the car make money when it isn't in use.

First, Tesla is looking to build an integrated solar-roof-with-battery product. It's part of the reason for the acquisition of SolarCity, and the two companies, according to Musk's vision, will be able to combine forces to build a single product. It'll combine batteries built at the Tesla Gigafactory with SolarCity's solar know-how.

Then, Tesla plans to expand beyond the Model S, Model X, and Model 3. Musk says there are plans for a future compact SUV and a ""new kind of pickup truck."" Then, for more industrial applications, he envisions heavy-duty electric trucks and solutions for ""high passenger-density urban transport — in other words, buses. Electric buses already exist today, so it's easy to see how that will work. Finally, Musk envisions the ""Tesla Semi"" which, he says, will delivery a ""substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport.""

Tesla's autonomous driving plans are well-known, as is its (beta) Autopilot system. The company plans to continue developing its hardware and software, and Musk says the beta label will be removed when Autopilot is ""approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average.""

Finally, Tesla plans to embrace vehicle sharing. ""When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere,"" Musk writes. Also, Tesla owners will be able to add their car to a ""Tesla shared fleet"" — likely an on-demand ride-hailing service that will allow the vehicle to give (autonomous) rides to the general public while the owner is at work or on vacation. Musk's vision is that if this system is used enough, the vehicle could potentially pay for itself.

In short, the ""Master Plan, Part Deux"" is:

Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it

The last ""Secret Tesla Master Plan"" was released back in 2006. It discussed how, according to Musk, power plant emissions are cleaner than vehicle emissions and how becoming ""energy positive"" with personal transportation — via solar panels from SolarCity, naturally — was possible. Here's how Musk laid out his plan back then:

So, in short, the master plan is: Build sports car Use that money to build an affordable car Use that money to build an even more affordable car While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options Don't tell anyone.

The Tesla Model 3, introduced earlier this year, was meant to be the ""even more affordable car"" And now, with Tesla buying SolarCity, it all comes together. Makes me wonder if maybe that was the plan all along?

Of course, before it can execute on the Master Plan, Part Deux, Tesla needs to finish executing the first Master Plan. Building that ""even more affordable car"" is not something the company has shown it can do yet. Building the Model 3 in volume will be a very real challenge and Musk is already looking past that to a whole host of other vehicles and products.

To be fair to Musk and Tesla, aside from being unable to stick to its timetable, the company has nevertheless achieved the goals laid out in the original plan. We'll see if he can do it again.

Thursday, he added another ambitious project to the list: Future Tesla vehicles will run their self-driving AI software on a chip designed by the automaker itself.

“We are developing customized AI hardware chips,” Musk told a room of AI experts from companies such as Alphabet and Uber on the sidelines of the world’s leading AI conference. Musk claimed that the chips’ processing power would help Tesla’s Autopilot automated-driving function save more lives, more quickly, by hastening the day it can drive at least 10 times more safely than a human. “We get there faster if we have dedicated AI hardware,” he said. He didn’t say how far along Tesla is in developing a chip, or when it will start shipping inside vehicles.

This may not be the ideal time for Musk and Tesla to be juggling a new complex and expensive technical project. Some 400,000 people have plunked down $1,000 to join the waitlist for the company’s new Model 3 sedan, but last month Musk conceded production was months behind schedule.

Musk took the stage Thursday in a historic Spanish revival building in Long Beach, California. Alongside him were Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s director of AI, and Jim Keller, a veteran chip engineer who became vice president in charge of Autopilot hardware last year. Their audience comprised 200 or so lucky attendees of NIPS, a premier academic machine-learning conference that has become a vital bragging and recruiting venue for leading tech companies.

Musk pitched his party as a kind of group hug with the AI community, parts of which he has sometimes been at odds with. He swore that he and Tesla care deeply about the field, and spoke of the company’s need for AI talent in software and hardware. Musk joked self-deprecatingly about his habit of using public appearances to warn that AI poses an existential threat to humanity. “You’ve all heard me sound the alarm bell—there he goes again,” he said, to friendly laughter from the free-drink swilling crowd. “I also think there are things where AI can really be useful, well before you get to godlike uber intelligence.”

As the evening wore on, Musk spoke of his worries about military uses of AI. And he suggested a regulatory agency of some kind might someday require very advanced AI systems to include ethical foundations. But Tesla’s primary use for AI is making sense of data from the cameras, radar, and other sensors through which its Autopilot system perceives the world.

Tesla owners are instructed to only use the system on highways today. Musk has said that a future software upgrade will permit “full self-driving” using the hardware inside existing vehicles. He repeated that claim Thursday, saying that the new chip in the works would improve the reliability of what was already possible. “If you have an order of magnitude more computing power, at a first order approximation that’s an order of magnitude more reliability,” he said.

Reliability will be crucial for self-driving cars. Software hiccups matter when you’re propelling thousands of pounds of machinery around the streets. A Tesla owner died last year when his Model S steered by Autopilot drove into the side of a tractor trailer pulling across the road ahead. The car’s vision system failed to register the white trailer against the bright sky. Tesla’s AI director Karpathy said Thursday that vision algorithms can be troubled by things like trucks with reflective rear ends, or walls painted to appear like roads. Musk hastened to add that he believes cars will soon be harder to fool than people, noting how they can use multiple sensors such as radar and cameras to verify what they’re seeing.

It might seem unlikely that an auto company could design a chip better than a chip company. But Musk’s chip guru Keller told the audience Thursday that nothing on the market is a good fit for Tesla’s mixture of sensors, or the reliability requirements of an auto. “You can get something a lot better if you really design what you want,” Keller said. He previously worked at Apple, AMD, and storied computing pioneer Digital Equipment.

In designing its own chips for AI, Tesla is following other big tech companies. The technique known as deep learning used by Tesla and others for tasks like interpreting camera data is taxing for conventional computer chips. Google, Microsoft, and Apple, have all created custom chips to power deep learning in the cloud or on mobile devices.

Those projects pose a challenge to established silicon suppliers, and Tesla’s chip effort could too. Tesla announced last year that all its vehicles would be powered by a computer for automated driving from Nvidia, the graphics-chip company that has morphed into the leading supplier of high-powered silicon for machine learning. Nvidia said queries about its relationship with Tesla should be directed to the automaker. Tesla declined to comment.

Musk dodged a question from WIRED Thursday about the nature and exact function of the chip his team is working on. But he did say it had features that address shortcomings of graphics chips that limit their efficiency—perhaps a reference to Nvidia. Musk said Tesla engineers calculate their chip will match the performance of existing products while consuming a tenth of the power, and costing a tenth of the price.

The chip project reflects Musk’s high expectations for Autopilot, and progress in competing self-driving projects. Last month Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving unit, said it no longer needed safety drivers in the front seat of its prototype automated vehicles in Phoenix.

On Thursday night, Musk predicted that his cars will be able to fully drive themselves better than a human in less than two years, and 10 times better in three years. The assembled AI experts roared with delight and astonishment.

CORRECTION, Dec. 10, 1:05 PM: Elon Musk predicted that Teslas would be able to fully drive themselves 10 times better than a human in three years. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he predicted the cars would drive 100 times better."

Tesla’s luxurious, all-electric speedsters have everyone’s head turned. But before you trade your kid’s college fund for one, let’s evaluate how much it will actually cost you.

There are two models available for immediate purchase from Tesla: the Model X crossover SUV and the Model S sedan. While they’re by no means budget cars, there are ways to save money when you buy a Tesla.

Tesla has also begun fulfilling orders for its Model 3, a car soaring in popularity because of its more affordable price tag: $35,000 before incentives. But unless you’re a Tesla employee or you already own a Tesla, getting your hands on a Model 3 will likely take more than a year.

If you’re in the market for a “green” vehicle, you should research how costs work for electric and hybrid cars. But we’re here to talk about Tesla, so let’s look at the base costs for its lineup.

Purchase price: Tesla Model S and Model X

Base prices for the 2017 Tesla Model S sedan range from $69,500 to $140,000, depending on the package. The 2017 Model X crossover ranges from $79,500 to $145,000. Further upgrades are available (more on that below). Earlier this year, Tesla updated its model options, discontinuing the Model S 60, S 75, S 60D, S 90D, X 90 and X 90D and adding the S 100, X 100D and X P100D.

Range: 289 mi $140,000 2.9 155

D signifies all-wheel driving capability; P signifies the “performance” category.

Tesla launched the all-electric Model S in 2012. It’s a hatchback sedan that competes with luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes. It can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds or less. It has room for seven passengers if you opt for the $4,000 rear-facing, third-row seat.

The Model S now starts at $74,500, and because of Tesla’s direct-order system, there’s no haggling. Simply visit a Tesla store online or in person, configure the car as you want it, and it will be built to your specifications. The base model comes in several different flavors, which cost up to $135,000.

Tesla also offers various upgrades, the most notable of which is self-driving capability. For a $4,000 after-delivery price tag, Tesla can activate eight cameras that pair with the onboard sonar, radar and computer to enable full self-driving in “almost all circumstances,” according to the maker. The system lets drivers simply enter the desired destination, and the car will take the wheel. Choosing this feature requires that you also spring for the enhanced autopilot option, an additional $6,000 after delivery — making the entire self-driving capability a grand total of $10,000 extra.

The SUV-style Model X, which Tesla rolled out in 2015, is now priced at $79,500 and up.

These readily available Tesla models are expensive, but there are factors that reduce the cost of buying and owning one, including tax incentives, fuel savings and insurance discounts.

Remember: If you’re thinking about buying a new car, it’s a good idea to shop for an auto loan in advance and work on the numbers with an online car loan calculator.

Federal and state tax credits

A federal tax credit for buying an electric car effectively reduces the price of a Model S by $7,500. In some states, additional tax credits or rebates can knock up to $9,500 off the purchase price. Drivers can claim rebates right after purchase or at tax time. Some states also offer noncash incentives such as car pool lane access and free parking.

Fuel costs

Let’s use fueleconomy.gov to compare a similarly priced luxury car: the BMW 7 Series 740i. If you drive it 15,000 miles per year, spend about $2.50 a gallon on gas and get an average of 25 miles per gallon, you can expect to spend about $1,500 on fuel annually.

Tesla drivers will save that money, but they’ll see an increased electric bill from charging the car overnight. To offset this, Tesla offers 400 kilowatt hours of free charging at its Supercharger stations each year, enough to drive approximately 1,000 miles. After this credit and based on the national average rate of 13 cents per kWh, charging your car at home would cost about $609 for the Model S and $690 for the Model X for 15,000 miles of driving a year. So we’ll deduct this from the gas savings.

Net savings: $891/$810 per year.

You can use Tesla’s charging costs calculator to customize your savings based on the cost of gas and electricity in your area.

Insurance discounts

NerdWallet found the lowest average insurance rates among 10 large insurers for the 2017 Tesla models in California and Florida, two states with high Tesla ownership levels. Drivers can also get discounts for eco-friendly cars offered by many insurance companies.

Cheapest Tesla insurance rates: California and FLORIDA

2017 model Florida California S 75D $1,789/year $1,906/year S 100D $1,791/year $2,047/year S P100D $1,815/year $1,946/year X 75D $1,748/year $1,672/year X 100D $1,748/year $1,672/year X P100D $1,889/year $2,057/year

Methodology: NerdWallet averaged rates from the largest insurers for 30-year-old men and women in 10 ZIP codes per state with 100/300/50 liability insurance limits, 100/300 uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage, and collision and comprehensive with a $1,000 deductible.

Insurance quotes vary greatly by company, state and individual driving record. It pays to compare rates.

What about the Model 3?

If you’ve done the math and would rather wait for the more affordable Model 3, you’re not alone. More than 500,000 people have signed up to reserve a Model 3 to date. The base version of the sedan will start at $35,000, have a range of 220 miles and go from zero to 60 mph in as little as 5.1 seconds.

Tesla describes the Model 3 on its website as: “a smaller, simpler, more affordable electric car” and “the safest car in its class.”

The company requires a $1,000 reservation fee for the Model 3 and is fulfilling orders within 12 to 18 months. Priority is given to Tesla employees and current owners of Teslas and then based on when you place your reservation. Reservation holders get an email when it’s their turn to place an order, then configure their car on the website and find out when it will be delivered. Tesla has dedicated a special FAQ page to questions about reserving the Model 3 and is releasing regular updates on details of the car.

Just remember: State incentives don’t last forever, and you shouldn’t count on them for future cars. Plus, while $35,000 is far less than even the cheapest Model S, you may still want to buy upgrades for your Model 3, which will close that gap.

And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.

“I do drive it a LOT,” he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.

They also tend to be people who like to live on technology’s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown’s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks."
https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16746054/tesla-semi-truck-preorder-anheuser-busch-budweiser,pos,0.999999008712949,9.912870308825707e-07,Tesla just received its largest preorder of Semi trucks yet,2017-12-07 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:23:00.803156,Dec,"Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser beer, announced today that it had placed an order for 40 Tesla Semi trucks, even though the truck won’t enter production until 2019. It’s one of the largest reservations of Elon Musk’s new truck to date.

Each reservation requires a $20,000 deposit, so that’s $800,000 in Tesla’s bank account right now (assuming the beer company placed its order after Tesla raised the deposit amount from the original price of $5,000). And if the trucks end up retailing for around $150,000, that would put Anheuser-Busch’s bill to the automaker at $6 million. (That’s if and when the trucks end up shipping — which, knowing Tesla, could be a moving target.)

$200,000 in Tesla’s bank account right now

Since it was unveiled last month, the Tesla Semi has racked up a fair number of preorders from several big-name players in shipping and logistics. The day after the announcement, Walmart said it had preordered 15 trucks, while JB Hunt Transport Services said it had reserved “multiple” new Tesla trucks as well.

In the weeks that followed, others lined up to put their deposit down, including Ryder, DHL, and Canadian supermarket chain Loblow. (Jalopnik just published a nice roundup of all the companies that have said they plan to purchase the trucks.)

Trucking industry veterans are watching closely to see how Tesla addresses some of the big hurdles in its path, such as per-mile cost, gaps in EV charging infrastructure, and maintenance issues.

For Anheuser-Busch, the Tesla Semi represents another opportunity to tout its commitment to reducing carbon emissions. The beer giant said it was “part of a company-wide strategy to employ cutting-edge technology to reduce the environmental impact and increase the efficiency of its operations.”

That strategy includes working with other tech-facing companies, such as Nikola Motors (“to develop and implement hydrogen-powered engines within our network”), Otto and Uber Freight (“to test autonomous driving technology”), and Convoy (“to access on-demand trucking capacity”).

Last year, Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to use Uber’s self-driving trucks, for a shipment of beer in Colorado. Since then, Uber’s autonomous trucks have received updated technology, but haven’t made any more public demonstrations thanks to a lawsuit from Alphabet alleging stolen trade secrets.

Update December 7th, 1:09PM ET: The deposit for reservations jumped from $5,000 to $20,000 right after the truck’s unveiling, a fact that was misstated in the original version of this article."
https://www.businessinsider.com/the-world-needs-to-stop-obsessing-over-how-many-cars-tesla-is-selling-2017-1,pos,1.0,1.6590765219248308e-16,The world needs to stop obsessing over how many cars Tesla is selling,2017-01-04 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:23:02.480247,Matthew Debord,"Tesla's California factory. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider On Tuesday, Tesla reported how many vehicles it built and, more importantly for investors, how many were delivered to customers during the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the full year.

On paper, the numbers were disappointing: Tesla missed its deliveries guidance for the year by around 4,000 vehicles, after indicating that it would deliver between 80-90,000 for much of 2016.

It became apparent midway through last year that Tesla probably wasn't going to hit the upper end of guidance, and in fact the company admitted as much be trimming back its guidance to 50,000 for the second half. But it also fell short of that number.

All these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, however. Tesla produced enough vehicles during the year to meet its guidance, over 80,000, a substantial increase over 2015's total. The carmaker just couldn't get them to customers.

2 key problems

Tesla has two key problems on this front. First, it's still a small automaker. Yearly production is what a major automaker might churn out in a month. This makes for issues when Tesla has to export US-made vehicles to markets abroad: the company has to wait for the boat to be full of stuff, other companies' stuff, before its cars can leave port.

Second, Tesla has no dealers, so unlike every other automaker on the planet, it has to wait until a customer officially signs the paperwork and takes possession of a vehicle before it can count a delivery.

A GM or a Ford can register a sale as soon as a vehicle leaves a factory because the customer has already ""paid"" — that customer is a dealer, and that dealer has often paid by having the automaker lend him or her money to establish inventory, a practice that in the industry is known as ""floor plan financing.""

At times, this means that although the carmakers have booked a sale, the vehicle is sitting on a dealer lot, languishing in inventory and compelling automakers to curtail production.

As someone who advocated for greater transparency from Tesla on deliveries before the company started releasing the quarterly totals — big carmakers report their sales each month, as they're doing on Wednesday — I now think investors and industry experts are paying too much attention to this metric.

Here's why. Tesla obviously doesn't have any issues around demand. It received almost 400,000 pre-orders for its Model 3 when the vehicle was revealed in early 2016, almost a full two years before the actually car would be available to buy. At its current rate of production, it should be able to double 2016's output in 2017 — and globally there should be no shortage of people who want to pay up for cars, regardless of how long they have to wait.

This is an enviable position for any business to be in, much less one that sells its products for $100,000 each. Tesla, by the way, has created this level of demand without ever doing any significant marketing or advertising. The big automakers, by contrast, are some of the largest advertisers to ever walk the Earth, spending billions annually to get the word out.

An unhealthy fixation

Nearly 400,000 pre-orders for the Model 3 rolled in after it was unveiled. AP Photo/Justin Pritchard The fixations on Tesla's delivery numbers has arisen due to the company's elevated stock price and market cap. Simply put, a lot of Tesla investors and the investment-banking analysts who guide them are boxed into a growth thesis that's dispiritingly information starved much of the time.

There's also a notable amount of short interest in Tesla, understandably, and those shorts need something to trade on.

At a macro level, Tesla is succeeding — it's the first successful new American car company to come along in decades, and its success is all the more remarkable because it's achieved it with an alternative propulsion system, in an economic environment where electric cars have managed to capture only about 1% of worldwide sales.

So the only way to evaluate how Tesla is doing it to take a long view and focus on the milestones: the vehicles launches and the year-over-year improvements, as well as the overall progress of the global shift from fossil-fuel power to renewable energy. This approach is the opposite of how many fast-growth companies and even plenty of established ones are considered; with them, it's quarter-by-quarter, relentlessly.

Tesla is the ultimate big-picture firm: If the big picture doesn't continue to come into focus, the company fails. But you have to be thinking big to even start looking.

Let's say Tesla doesn't fail, and that it becomes an important mobility provider in the future, on a par with a GM or Toyota today.

If that happens, no one will care if Tesla delivered 80,000 vehicles in 2016 or 800,000. The question will be: Did it produce and sell enough cars to keep the story going?

In this sense, the 2016 production and deliveries totals are outstanding. The company is on the road to a 100,000-vehicles production pace in 2017, and after 100,000 comes 200,000, and don't forget that Musk says the automaker will hit 500,000 by 2018.

That's the most important number Tesla has in front of it. What happens between now and then, as long as production doesn't fall back and demand doesn't evaporate, is noise, and we should start to discount its importance."

Tesla is aiming to be the Apple of the car business

To understand what the market might be thinking, it's worth remembering what happened in the cell phone industry a decade ago. Back in 2007, the cell phone market was dominated by Nokia with 435 million units followed by Motorola with 164 million units. Apple released the first iPhone that year but it sold fewer than 4 million units. So it would have been easy for a naïve analyst at the time to dismiss Apple as a minor player. What that analyst would have missed, of course, was that the nature of cell phones was about to change. The kind of old-fashioned ""feature phones"" that accounted for the bulk of Nokia's sales was about to be rendered obsolete by the iPhone and a new wave of Android-based smartphones. Nokia executives weren't too worried. They didn't have the iPhone, but they had plenty of engineers and strong relationships with mobile network operators around the world. They assumed they'd be able to build a rival smartphone operating system and be a major player in the smartphone business. But making an iPhone-quality smartphone proved to be harder than they expected, and Nokia was caught flat-footed. Efforts to create its own software floundered, and a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone software failed to gain traction. The company was forced to sell its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2014 — a humiliating end for a company that once led the cell phone industry. We don't know if something like this is in the cards for Ford and other conventional automakers, but it would be one way to explain why Tesla is so highly valued compared to Ford. Ford executives think they can easily pivot to making electric, software-driven cars, just as Nokia thought they could adapt to a smartphone world.

Apple sells 20 percent of smartphones and earns most of the profits

One other important lesson from the smartphone world is that profits in a high-tech industry are sometimes much more skewed than market share. Apple sells fewer than 20 percent of the world's smartphones. But the fact that Apple makes both the hardware and software for the iPhone helps it stand apart in the marketplace, allowing Apple to charge a much bigger premium than its Android-based rivals. The result: Despite the iPhone's modest market share, Apple's quarterly profits often dwarf the profits of all other smartphone makers combined. Like Apple, Tesla makes many components of its cars, from batteries to self-driving software, in house. Its roots in Silicon Valley mean that the software on its cars is likely to be better than software produced by a company like Ford — a factor that will become even more important as self-driving technology becomes an important factor in the industry. Like Apple, Tesla has a significant base of ardent fans who follow the company's every move and are eager to buy the company's new products.

Tesla's big bet on batteries could pay off handsomely"
https://www.vox.com/2016/6/9/11880450/tesla-doomed,pos,1.0,8.807178285909217e-40,Tesla’s real problem isn’t that its cars are expensive. It’s that they’re unreliable.,2016-06-09 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:23:07.063355,Jun,"Few companies have enjoyed more hype over the past few years than electric carmaker Tesla. And not without reason: Tesla is the most successful automaking startup in decades and has almost singlehandedly made electric cars cool.

Yet the automaker has also been struggling with the quality of its vehicles. On Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealed it was investigating a possible problem with the suspension of Tesla's flagship Model S sedans. The reported flaw is the latest in a series of quality and reliability problems with Tesla's vehicles.

Industry analyst Edward Niedermeyer, who blogs at the Daily Kanban, argues that Tesla's challenges with vehicle quality are only going to get worse in the coming years. Tesla is preparing to release the Model 3, whose modest $35,000 price tag is designed to appeal to mainstream customers. And Niedermeyer argues that middle-class customers are less forgiving of quality problems than the wealthy customers Tesla has served so far.

Tesla's basic problem, Niedermeyer argues, is culture. Industry leader Toyota conquered the American car market with a rigorous manufacturing process that emphasized quality and reliability above all else. But Tesla has a freewheeling Silicon Valley culture that values innovation and creativity over reliable execution.

We spoke by phone last week. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Timothy B. Lee: You're skeptical that a Silicon Valley company like Tesla can become a major player in the auto business. Why do you think cars are different from software?

Edward Niedermeyer: To boil it down to the most essential issue, it's a question of scale. With software, you have a fixed cost of development that is oftentimes quite high, but once you have a viable product and you pay off that fixed cost, your variable cost to scale beyond that is almost nonexistent. You're literally just copying code.

With automobiles, not only do you have immense fixed costs in research and development, tooling up factories, creating testing, but once you've done all the development work for a car, you still have a process of scaling. Not only are the variable material and labor costs much higher than in software, but you also have a lot of details that can go wrong.

""The cheaper the car, the more people tend to rely on it, and the more reliability and quality come into play""

Cars have become so reliable and so easy to use that we think about them less than we ever have in the 100-plus-year history of the automobile. This is one reason we don't appreciate this depth of complexity. Not only are cars different from software in very fundamental ways, they're much more complicated than anything else consumers buy.

Cars use a wide variety of materials, built into components and subassemblies by massive global supply chains. Car companies have to choose and develop the right materials and components, maintain their uniformity and integrity throughout that supply chain, and ensure that they operate reliably in almost every imaginable condition on Earth.

A great example is the problem of mold growing from inside the Model S's roof, particularly in Norwegian cars. Because its large panoramic sunroof is difficult to manufacture and install to a precise specification, Model S roofs often leak. A lot of those leaks are so small that customers might not notice. But because Tesla used an organic-fiber pad at the edge of the sunroof, aggressive molds invade at alarming rates in certain climates. This kind of complex, cascading defect is why automakers value their accumulated institutional knowledge and spend years testing vehicles.

TBL: It seems like Tesla's early cars — the 2008 Roadster and the 2012 Model S — were lauded for their innovative designs and were well-received by customers. But you're skeptical about the Model 3, which is more affordable and aimed at a mass market. What's the difference?

EN: It's a common misperception that the more expensive the car, the more people expect out of it. The opposite is true: the cheaper the car, the more people tend to rely on it, and the more reliability and quality come into play.

The car business is a very risk-averse business by nature. It's capital-intensive and relatively low-margin. The first 50 years or so after the Model T (in 1908) was focused on technology development. People pushed the limits in terms of power, styling, futurism.

""Tesla is a throwback to an earlier era of the auto industry""

Since the 1970s or so, it's reverted to a kind of more pragmatic, utilitarian mode. The market has become more mature. Toyota and Honda have really made their names on quality and reliability, not exciting futuristic values.

In a lot of ways, Tesla is a throwback to an earlier era of the auto industry. They tap into the idea that there is new technological space to be conquered; you get there by focusing on performance, on building a very attractive, appealing car. That's what Ferrari and Lamborghini did between the 1930s and the 1960s.

I think that parallel is worth looking at, because neither Ferrari nor Lamborghini is known for quality. If you operate in the high end of the market, consumers appreciate performance and design. If their Ferrari or Lamborghini breaks down, they have their chauffeur take them in a Mercedes or a Lexus.

It's not the end of the world that Tesla's quality has been bad so far, because they're operating in a luxury space. But as they move down market with the Model 3, reliability and quality are going to be real issues. The level of quality they've achieved in the Model S is not going to be sufficient to succeed in the $30,000-to-$50,000 price range.

TBL: Is it really that hard to improve manufacturing quality? Elon Musk is a smart guy, and he recently put his desk at the end of the Model X assembly line so he can personally keep an eye on the progress there.

EN: Anything is possible. Obviously they've proven doubters wrong before. So I'm not going to say that it's impossible for them to do it again.

But raising quality is very different from the things they've done to gain market position so far.

One parallel that's worth thinking about is General Motors. This was the most successful car company in the world for the better part of a century and the most valuable company for a period of time. Then they got surpassed on quality in the 1970s, and they still haven't caught up.

So the question is what makes the quality of Japanese companies? I think you can trace that back to Toyota, which developed the Toyota production system and — just as importantly — a broader corporate philosophy called the Toyota way. It systematizes everything about the production of automobiles.

For example, the need to keep plants operating at a high rate meant you'd let defects go down the line and fix them at the end. One of the things Toyota did was when the defect came down the line, you stop the line and you trace the defect back to its root and fix it, then you restart production. This is just one example.

To this day, they're still the leaders in quality. Nobody has caught up with them.

TBL: But GM in the 1970s was a big, bureaucratic organization tied down with a lot of union rules. It seems like it should be easier for a young and nimble company like Tesla to pivot and adopt a more Toyota-like production philosophy.

EN: It's certainly more likely because they're not at the point where Ford and GM and Chrysler were when they faced that challenge — they already had tens of thousands of workers and faced much more inertia.

But in the first half of the 20th century, Detroit was the equivalent at the time of Silicon Valley today. Yes, Tesla is a startup culture, but they demonstrate an arrogance that is similar to the arrogance that Detroit demonstrated in the past. When a culture works really well, there's an assumption that it can be universalized. I think that shows in the thinking that Silicon Valley culture will apply to manufacturing.

But what does startup culture emphasize? It emphasizes flexibility, individual effort, and working long hours to reach ambitious goals. What it's not is regimented.

""Silicon Valley demonstrates an arrogance that is similar to the arrogance that Detroit demonstrated in the past""

But the only way to make money in cars is at huge scale. And scale creates immense complexity. And as you go up the volume scale, it becomes more challenging. So if your goal is to make your car company a mass-market player, you have to bake in the regimentation and the production system from the get-go.

When I say companies are risk-averse, it's because success in the car business is not about reaching out into the unknown in order to achieve unprecedented things. It's about driving waste, inefficiency, and defects out of your production machine. That is what Toyota's innovations enabled it to do. It systematized every aspect of development and production.

TBL: What do you think about the approach Google has taken to the car business?

EN: Google's strategy is the counterfactual that makes me especially nervous about Tesla. Google's core technology is the autonomous drive capability, and I think they have to be closely watching Tesla and the struggles they've had. So Google has hired some very high-profile people from the car business. They have former Ford CEO Alan Mulally on their board. Lawrence Burns, the former research and development boss for General Motors, is a consultant for them. The head of their autonomous car program is John Krafcik, one of the auto industry's most respected veterans.

It's a dream team of real tier-one automaker experience. With their accumulated knowledge — and looking at Tesla's struggles — they know that building their own car is a fool's mission. They also recognize that Silicon Valley culture is fundamentally different from manufacturing culture.

They realize there are plenty of car companies and car factories in the world. Even before autonomous drive comes out, there's a likelihood that shared mobility will begin to impact demand for cars, leaving spare production capacity for autonomous vehicles.

What fundamentally sets Google apart is that these auto people know how hard building cars is. It is not only an intellectual challenge, it's a discipline challenge. Managing that level of complexity requires a certain amount of accumulated knowledge; building that from scratch is incredibly difficult.

""What fundamentally sets Google apart is that these auto people know how hard building cars is""

And these systems are already highly automated. It's not like the car guys are doing purchase orders on paper. They already need to be highly software-driven in order to make current levels of complexity work. I'm not sure how much room Silicon Valley has to improve that. If they do, they should develop the capability and sell it to the car companies.

So Tesla is fundamentally an old-school car company. They sell you a desirable, high-performing vehicle that you own. Google is trying to transform mobility without becoming a car company. Their focus is on autonomy. They have the leading position right now in terms of self-driving capability. They're going to continue to build on that.

TBL: It seems like the danger of partnering with existing car companies is that they could be too set in their ways, and too resistant to making the kind of changes that are required for self-driving cars to be really successful.

EN: At first, there was this sense that Google was going to directly take on the car companies and take them out of business. The car companies, without question, have cultural biases that prevent them from wanting to develop autonomous vehicles.

These companies have been around for 100 years. They've only ever sold vehicles to drivers, and the vast majority of their profits came from selling cars to drivers. Because cars are low-margin, you have to find ways to pad that margin, and they do it with things that appeal to a driver, like a more powerful engine or a sport suspension.

Fully autonomous vehicles will be fundamentally different. But Google has singlehandedly pushed autonomy from being a science experiment to something that's going to be viable. They have forced the car industry to accept that things are changing.

So what Google is doing is very pragmatic. Instead of having this existential battle between human drivers versus robot drivers, they've shown that this technology works and argued that they need to work together. It's going to be very disruptive to car companies' business to manage the change from driven vehicles to autonomous vehicles. But they're not fighting it. They're going along with it.

I think this is something that's emerged in the last year. What both sides have realized is that Google can avoid massive investments in very low-margin aspects of the business, while car companies can stay with the times if they work with Google or other startups.

TBL: It seems like we're going to see some big changes in the car industry over the next decade. Which car companies do you see as best positioned to navigate those changes?

EN: You see two responses. You see General Motors and Nissan initially trying to get on this wave of excitement and saying, We're going to set aggressive timelines for autonomous capability. GM made the biggest investment by buying Cruise. I've done a bit of research on Cruise and I'm not super convinced by them. I'm not convinced that GM didn't massively overpay.

Toyota has a much different approach. They are basically making a long-term investment in the research capabilities for autonomous driving. Their deployment strategy is super conservative. They are deploying in bits and pieces. They're starting off by putting low-level semi-autonomous safety functions in all of their vehicles.

""We have a celebrity news cycle where we tend to build things up and break them down""

That's in part due to their culture and in part due to their experience of the unintended acceleration scandal of 2010, where they were basically accused of having self-driving cars. As far as I can tell — and I spent a lot of time covering it — it was basically bullshit and kind of a witch hunt.

But the legal liability risks are very high. It's very easy for people to make mistakes and blame the car for their mistakes. So in some ways that's an incentive to go full autonomy. But even for a company like Toyota with $80 billion in the bank, there could be liability issues that could challenge the fate of the company. So they are incredibly conservative about deployment, and they will not deploy anything unless it works in 99.9 percent of use cases.

That contrasts with what Tesla is doing, a public beta test. They say they are. They admit it. Frankly, that is an incredibly risky proposition. I think Tesla has a halo right now. I think we have a celebrity news cycle where we tend to build things up and break them down. Once Tesla reaches a critical point in that hype cycle, the public beta test of autopilot software could be part of what destroys them as a company.

I personally tend to like Toyota's approach, because they accept and own the conservative nature of the business. So they don't fool themselves that they're going to do this leapfrog approach.

An assembly line worker says others mocked his pants as ""gay tight.""

An engineer says she was taunted and catcalled on the factory floor, and was fired from the company after she sued for gender discrimination, including unequal pay.

Four lawsuits filed in recent months describe a toxic culture at the plant in Fremont, California, where Tesla manufactures its electric cars and where about 10,000 people work.

The suits also make Tesla the latest Silicon Valley company to come under scrutiny after workers alleged discrimination. The best-known example is Uber, where complaints of sexual harassment ultimately forced out the CEO.

In statements, Tesla told CNN Tech that it takes all complaints seriously. But it said that, ""in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company. Not one.""

The workers are suing for mistreatment on Tesla's factory premises, alleging inaction by the company and, in some cases, the third-party staffing companies it contracts with. Those companies are also named in the suits.

The plaintiffs, in some cases, say they were retaliated against after they came forward.

At least four workers claim they were discriminated against at the factory because of race.

DeWitt Lambert, a former electrician, alleges that coworkers called him the N-word and flashed gang signs at him, and that one worker threatened to ""cut Mr. Lambert up into pieces and send his body parts to his family members.""

Tesla, in response, says Lambert frequently socialized with the men he's accusing, that other employees say Lambert used ""the same racially insensitive language that he had complained about,"" and that his complaint to the company about them was an ""attempt to turn the tables"" because he thought they had reported him first.

The company said it fired several employees after investigating, adding ""...it's also clear that DeWitt's version of events is not supported by the facts.""

""There was no objective evidence that anything inappropriate occurred"" toward Lambert, the company says in a statement, noting that he was transferred to another work area after complaining to HR about the employees.

Tesla said it has suspended Lambert with pay while it continues to investigate the situation.

When asked for comment, Lambert's lawyers -- Lawrence A. Organ and Navruz Avloni of the California Civil Rights Law Group -- questioned Tesla's response. ""Tesla has admitted to the press that Mr. Lambert's harassers were disciplined. If this wasn't harassment, why did it discipline his harassers?""

In another lawsuit filed last week, three people who worked for a Tesla contractor allege that coworkers called them racial epithets. That suit was filed by Demetric Diaz, a production associate, and two elevator operators, Lamar Patterson and Owen Diaz.

Tesla said it only learned about the complaints in that suit through media reports, and that the three men never raised a complaint within the company.

According to the suit, the plaintiffs did report the problem to Tesla and, in some cases, the third-party staffing companies who employed them and put them to work inside Tesla.

Organ and Avloni -- the lawyers representing Lambert in his suit, as well as the other three men alleging racial discrimination in their separate lawsuit -- say they've received an outpouring of calls from current and former employees about discrimination at the factory since Lambert filed the suit in March.

""At some point, we were receiving dozens of calls per day,"" Avloni, a managing attorney at the ‎California Civil Rights Law Group, told CNN Tech. ""Most of the calls from Tesla employees are related to race harassment issues, which is reflective of how serious this problem is at the company.""

The complaints against Tesla go beyond race.

AJ Vandermeyden, an engineer at the factory, sued the company in the fall of 2016 for gender discrimination while she still worked there.

She alleged that male engineers were paid higher salaries and promoted ahead of women who were equally or more qualified. In addition, she said, she endured ""inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls"" on the factory floor, she said.

Vandermeyden was fired in May, she claims in retaliation for her lawsuit. Her case is in arbitration, according to her lawyer.

The company goes on to say that after hiring an outside investigator, it became ""absolutely convinced that Ms. Vandermeyden's claims were illegitimate,"" and had no choice but to fire her.

In fact, Tesla claims that Vandermeyden ""was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications.""

Related: Bill seeks to curb tech's sexual harassment problem

In another lawsuit, Jorge Ferro, an assembly line production worker, alleges that a supervisor repeatedly harped on his sexuality, telling him that everyone suspected he was gay, and commenting that his pants were ""too tight -- gay tight.""

He was threatened with taunts to watch his back, according to a lawsuit filed in May and revealed by The Guardian this week.

After reporting the harassment to a superior, he claims, he was fired because of an ""injury"" -- which Ferro said was a scar he'd had for 16 years. He's suing to get his job reinstated, as well as for damages. The case is in private mediation.

A Tesla spokesperson said that while Ferro and the supervisor are employed by a third party, ""Tesla still stepped in to try to keep these individuals apart from one another and to ensure a good working environment.""

In its statement, as with the other statements provided for this article, the spokesperson alluded to the misuse of its name in lawsuits to garner media attention.

""... it maximizes the chances of generating publicity for their case,"" the company said in a statement. ""They abuse our name, because they know it is catnip for journalists. Tesla takes any and every form of discrimination or harassment extremely seriously. There is no company on Earth with a better track record than Tesla."""

It’s been refined and improved over the years and Tesla leads all automakers in self-driving tech that you can actually buy. But other automakers are ready to give the electric upstart some much-needed competition. Mercedes-Benz is first up, releasing the next generation of its Drive Pilot system this summer in the nonpareil S-Class. I tested it out this week on a twisting desert road in Nevada and, you might be surprised to learn, it’s better than Elon’s.

A Mercedes SUV picked me up in Las Vegas for an hour-long trip to the desert. A company rep apologized for the long ride, but said they couldn’t find a curvy road closer to the city. Most Nevada roads are straight and flat, something I noticed much more after they pointed it out, and the Germans needed some curves to show what Drive Pilot can do.

The car does 80 percent of the driving.

Drive Pilot is to the steering wheel what adaptive cruise is to stop and go pedals. Like Tesla’s Autopilot, the Mercedes system allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed, while still supervising the overall operation of the car. Think of the driver as a manager in charge of employees: they’re controlling overall direction, but not micromanaging each individual operation.

A simpler version of Drive Pilot is available today in the 2017 Mercedes E-Class, and Daimler AG board member Ola Källenius told me that the new Drive Pilot can take charge of 80 percent of driving tasks, while the more primitive E-Class version can only handle a paltry 20 percent of the job.

It’s activated by pressing a button on the steering wheel and the car will maintain speed and keep within its lane. Though the driver doesn’t need to keep a hand on the wheel, it will request a driver response every 10 seconds or so, depending on current road conditions. A pair of capacitive-touch buttons on the steering wheel can be used to acknowledge the request, which starts with a visual notification and escalates to an insistent bonging if ignored.

Keep ignoring the warnings — or in the event of a medical emergency — and the car will initiate a controlled-but-determined “emergency stop” in the middle of the roadway, activating the hazard lights to warn other motorists that there’s a problem. Tesla’s system acts similarly, though the Mercedes goes a step further and contacts the Mercedes SOS service where a live agent is connected to provide assistance and contact emergency personnel, if needed.

After some time without input, the car will request that you put your hands on the wheel

If you still don’t grab the wheel, the car will bring itself to a stop and turn on the hazard lights

Turn on the turn signal and the car will automatically slow down so you can turn safely

The system adapts to how much steering force is used, which allows the driver to decide exactly how much input to give. Use a light touch and the steering assist does most of the work. Apply a firmer hand and the system seamlessly gives up control. With Tesla’s Autopilot, applying steering force results in a slightly alarming jerk of the wheel when the system disengages. Mercedes engineers told me they wanted anyone to be able to take control of the car without any difficulty, noting more than once that the driver was always in charge, no matter how much work the car was doing on their behalf.

“We put a lot of energy into making this human-machine interaction as complementary as possible,” said Tobias Mueller, a communications executive with Mercedes-Benz. “It’s not the machine versus you, but it’s you together.”

The system is also intentionally less precise than it’s capable of. With Drive Pilot in control through some sweeping turns, I noticed the car drift slightly within the lane. It wasn’t heading over the line, but it wasn’t fixed exactly in the center like one might expect a computer to do. Mercedes programmed this drift deliberately, encouraging the car to move a little bit within the lane both to improve ride comfort depending on road camber and other factors. It’s also to remind the driver that Drive Pilot is only an assist system, not fully autonomous.

“the car is assisting you, but it’s not doing the entire job for you.”

“It’s actually so you don’t feel too safe,” Mueller told me. “That sounds stupid, but it’s to make you stay engaged and aware of what’s going on around you. It’s letting you know that the car is assisting you, but it’s not doing the entire job for you.”

Making the system feel less safe might seem counter-intuitive, but Mercedes wants drivers to understand exactly what Drive Pilot is doing. A number of carmakers have criticized Tesla for its Autopilot system, with a Volvo engineer even calling it a “wannabe” because he felt Autopilot gives the impression that it’s capable of handling more situations than it really is. That Mercedes has tweaked its car to make it seem less capable is a clever and calculated move to keep drivers from becoming overconfident in its abilities.

Last year, Tesla changed the the way Autopilot behaves when the driver is too inattentive. Now, after 15 seconds of ignoring audible and visual warnings, the car begins a “graceful abort procedure” where the music is muted, the vehicle begins to slow, and the driver is continuously requested to place their hands on the wheel. Tesla will also disable the system until the car is power cycled if the driver ignores too many requests to place their hands on the wheel. Like Tesla, Mercedes’ Drive Pilot varies on how often it requests driver interaction, depending on the road or speed of the vehicle.

Drive Pilot has some other tricks as well. Using mapping data as well as speed limit signs (even the yellow ones in America that suggest, but not require, lower speeds for sharp bends), the system can slow down for sharp corners. It gives a subtle notification to let the driver know why it’s slowing down, and the system can even take corners slightly more aggressively — at higher speeds and with quicker braking and accelerating actions — if the car is in Sport mode rather than Comfort. Tesla uses “fleet-learned roadway curvature” to know how to take corners, which is a fancy way to say “the more you use it, the smarter it gets.”

If a driver activates the turn signal ahead of a left or right turn onto a side road, Drive Pilot will slow the car enough to make the turn without the driver touching the brake at all. In this case, it’s up to the driver to physically turn the wheel (and ensure that the operation is safe), but for many turns, no pedal action will be necessary. Once the turn is complete, the car resumes the preset speed, or even slows down if it detects a lower speed limit. “You need to reengage the system a lot less because it can stay active for a lot longer time,” said Mueller.

On a multi-lane highway, the system is capable of handling lane changes when prompted by the driver. Activate the turn signal for a lane change and the car uses blind-spot monitoring and rear-facing radar to do its own checks and make sure there’s no car in the way. It’s ultimately up to the driver to ensure that the maneuver is safe to perform, but once the turn signal is on and the car sees it’s OK, it can take care of actually turning the wheel. Tesla’s Autopilot has a similar feature.

Drive Pilot can handle speeds up to 130 MPH

Drive Pilot can handle speeds up to 130 miles per hour (much of the Autobahn network in Mercedes’ homeland has no speed limit, after all), and the car is relying on the driver to make appropriate decisions on speed. However, the car will never automatically adjust its speed over the speed limit — it must be the driver’s decision. The car gets much of its speed limit information from its on-board maps and uses on-board cameras for verification. If the camera sees a different speed limit, whether because the mapping data was wrong or because it’s a temporary speed zone because of construction, the car can act automatically and reduce speed.

It’s also up to the driver to decide whether to activate the system in poor weather. The front radar is heated to keep snow from building up, but determining whether it’s appropriate to use is judgement call that Mercedes stays away from. Volvo’s fully autonomous system, which is a few years away from being available to consumers, will not activate if the weather is poor — but Mercedes doesn’t want to its car involved in the decision at all.

I agree with the Volvo engineer who said Tesla’s system pretended to be more capable than it was. Tesla’s Autopilot is almost too good. Because it’s competent with uncomplicated driving, it’s easy to forget that it’s totally useless when something weird happens. But weird things happen all the time, and over reliance on a relatively limited system can be disastrous.

Last March, I took an Autopilot-equipped Tesla on a long road trip through the Rockies, on everything from divided interstates to twisting mountain roads. It was a tale of two Autopilots. On well-marked highways, Tesla’s system was nearly flawless. But on mountain roads it was terrifying at times. The car would barrel up to sharp corners that were meant to be taken at 15 mph, only to abruptly disengage hand over control to the driver. More than once was corrective action needed to avoid an accident. But it served as a useful reminder the driver is ultimately in charge.

it’s easy to gain a false sense of security

Because Autopilot (and Mercedes Drive Pilot) seem so capable, it’s easy to gain a false sense of security about its abilities. Tesla tells me that Autopilot has significantly improved since March, thanks to all that’s been learned from its huge fleet of vehicles, and a huge Autopilot update was released in September.

I firmly believe that other carmakers had the technology to offer functionality similar to Tesla’s Autopilot when it launched (manufacturer reps refuse to comment on the record). Audi, Cadillac, and several others have their own autopilots in the works. But, possibly because of concerns over reliability and customer misuse, these carmakers decided to hold off until they felt confident that the systems could be implemented safely.

When they’re ready, the competition will be fierce. The Drive Pilot system that I tested is nearly identical to what will be launched this summer in the new S-Class. I think it’s slightly better than Tesla’s Autopilot thanks to its ability to slow down for turns at T-intersections and roundabouts. More competition is only good news for car buyers but, with others steadily joining the race, Tesla is about to lose one of its biggest differentiators. Your move, Elon."

Personal robots, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, have come a long way in recent years. But fundamentally, they’re still stationary speakers whose defining expression is a light that turns on when you speak.

Jibo is different. It’s not just that he—and I use the term he here, because that’s how Jibo refers to himself—looks like something straight out of a Pixar movie, with a big, round head and a face that uses animated icons to convey emotion. It’s not just that his body swivels and swerves while he speaks, as if he’s talking with his nonexistent hands. It’s not just that he can giggle and dance and turn to face you, wherever you are, as soon as you say, “Hey, Jibo.” It’s that, because of all this, Jibo seems downright human in a way that his predecessors do not.

And while that technology may seem merely amusing—or creepy, depending on your point of view—it could fundamentally reshape how we interact with machines.

Jibo still has a lot to learn. Although he can help users in basic ways, like by summarizing news stories and taking photos, he can’t yet play music requests or work with third-party apps like Domino’s and Uber, which, at $899, could make him a tough sell. But Matt Revis, the company’s vice president of product management, is confident Jibo will evolve. “There was a threshold we had to reach in order to launch,” says Revis. “Now it’s part of the journey.” —Lisa Eadicicco

As you’d expect from a BMW, it’s an overly-technological solution: they have built essentially a BMW engine-sound synthesizer that responds to the tachometer and gas pedal data from the car’s data bus. They also let you turn off the “acoustic experience”.

To our taste, the Porsche Sound Symposer and Mustang Boss 302 systems are a little more honest. The former has an actual additional pipe in the exhaust system that (optionally) allows authentic engine sound into the cockpit. The Mustang adds extra resonant tubes to the exhaust, running alongside the mufflers. There’s a restrictor plate that separates them, limiting the amount of extra noise produced. Remove this plate, and you’ve got a noise monster.

These cars are all victims of their own success. The BMW’s frame is so good at noise damping that it became eerie to drive for some enthusiasts. All of the engines run quieter and more efficiently than their gas-guzzling predecessors.

But we’re in this strange transitional period where the tech has outpaced our own preconceptions of power. People still want the roar, even though cars with silent electric motors are going to be beating gas guzzlers out of the blocks as a matter of course in the very near future. You just can’t beat the starting torque of an electric motor (without burning out your clutch).

Our guess is that future generations will look back and laugh. That said, we’re all still taking photos with CMOS sensors that have a speaker attached just to go “click” and the old-timey phone bell ringtone is still going strong. People are funny.

It results from early identification of the trends that will be driving a market, which often means understanding what consumers will like before they know it themselves, coupled with understanding how these trends will be affecting the market, before they actually have. Forecasting oil demand on this basis leads to interesting – and for some shocking – insights.

Current Oil Demand

Since global oil demand results from a number of different segments of the global economy, each of which is impacted by different trends, current oil demand first needs to broken down to its main components before a trend-based forecast can be developed.

According to data from the international energy agency (IEA), at present the largest driver for oil demand is transportation, being responsible for approximately 56 percent of total oil demand, some 52 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2015. Second is industrial demand from industries such as iron, steel, cement production, construction and mining, who together make up 15 percent of global oil demand, or 14 mb/d. Petrochemicals are third, being responsible for 12 percent of global oil demand, or 11 mb/d, while power generation is fourth with 6 percent, or 6 mb/d. The remaining 11 percent of global demand, or 10 mb/d, comes from a range of different industries such as agriculture, bitumen and lubricants.

Transportation, the largest driver for oil demand, is by no means a homogenous group, however, since it consists of the components passenger vehicles (25 mb/d), commercial vehicles (17 mb/d), aviation (6 mb/d) and marine (5 mb/d). Some of the components of transportation are larger drivers for oil demand than the non-transportation drivers. A trend-based forecast of global oil demand therefore requires a breakdown of current oil demand like that of graph 1.

Passenger Vehicle Trends

While the total number of passenger driven light vehicles (PDLVs) on the road will most likely continue to increase, in particular in places such as China and India, the extent to which this will drive an increase in crude oil demand is debatable.

Under pressure from tightening emissions regulations, passenger vehicle fuel economy has improved substantially over recent years. In the United States, for example, the sales weighted average for fuel economy has increased from 20.8 mpg in 2008 to 25.1 mpg in 2017 – a 25 percent increase despite a trend toward larger vehicles (SUVs) amongst consumers. And there is no reason to assume that sometime in the near future this trend will suddenly end. Related: Goldman Sachs Warns Of Global Oil Demand Peak

What is very likely, however, is a gradual increase in the share of electric vehicles (EVs) in the global passenger vehicle pool, as fundamentally, EVs can meet the transportation need of consumers in a manner that is superior to what conventional internal combustion vehicles (ICEVs) offer – more seating and storage space for an equal size, faster yet smoother acceleration and deceleration, less maintenance, greater reliability, and lower environmental and noise pollution, amongst other things. Recent additions to the range of EV models available have essentially already kicked off this electrification revolution. These cars, such as Chevrolet’s Bolt and the Tesla models, offer a driving range that well exceeds the needs of a typical daily commute, and that is essentially on par with the range offered by ICEVs. Driven by improvements in battery technology, the lifetime ownership cost of these EVs is also inching closer to that of ICEVs. Already, the EV’s cost of operation (fuel) and maintenance is well below that of ICEVs. By the middle of the 2020s, battery technology is expected to have improved to the point where EVs are cheaper to produce than ICEVs, at which point EVs will outperform ICEVs on a cost-basis comprehensively and become the preferred passenger vehicle option (“no brainer”) in most parts of the world. (Interestingly, the two countries that are expected to drive growth in the global vehicle pool, China and India, are also the ones pursuing electrification of their vehicle fleet most aggressively.)

This would mean that the stock of ICEVs should be expected to stop growing as of the middle of the 2020s and enter a period of gradual decline thereafter. (Since the typical lifetime of an ICEV is 10 – 15 years in developed economies, and 15 – 20 years in the developing world, it is not unreasonable to expect, as some have argued, that by 2040 all miles driven will be electric and oil demand from passenger vehicles will have decreased to essentially zero.)

Commercial Vehicle Trends

For a trend-based forecast, Commercial Vehicles should be further subdivided in three sub-components, being light commercial vehicles (LCVs) that are designed to transport goods over shorter distances, heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) that are designed to transport goods over longer distances, and busses that transport people.

As a group, Commercial Vehicles have been a major factor in global oil demand growth over recent years, adding nearly 6 mb/d to global growth since 2000. For some of its segments electrification is by now a clear trend, however, raising doubts as to how much exactly Commercial Vehicles will drive oil demand growth in the future.

For example, the electrification of busses is already taking place. This is because the task busses perform can be electrified relatively easily, while the benefits of doing so are substantial. Most busses drive short, inner city routes, covering distances that current battery technology can already manage. Because the utilization rate of busses is much higher than that of PDLVs, and their driving is characterized by continuous stop-and-go, the potential benefits of electrification are actually greater than in the case of PDLVs. For this reason countries and cities around the world have enacted plans to electrify their bus fleet, in order to promote bus usage (by providing bus users a much smoother stop-and-go experience), capture monetary savings on maintenance and fuel, cut inner city emissions and reduce noise pollution. The electrification of busses should therefore be expected to pick up pace during the 2020s. (Some expect that by 2030 the bus sub-component of Commercial Vehicles will be electrified to a large extent already.) This means that oil demand growth associated with busses should be expected to diminish from the second half of the 2020s onward, and might even turn negative from 2030 onward.

For LCVs electrification offers similar benefits as for busses, but the challenge of practically making it happen is greater as since the use of LCVs is more diverse. Consequently, for certain uses electrification makes more sense – and is as a result more advanced – than for others, but in general it is well behind the electrification of PDLVs and even that of busses. LCV linked oil demand should therefore be expected to continue to grow in line with economic growth well into the 2020s, and possibly even beyond that. The risk to this demand growth is regulation, however, as many cities today are considering putting in place limits on truck traffic – some have already put policies in place that will ban diesels from their inner cities by 2025. This regulatory trend can drive investment and innovation in electrified LCVs, which could speed up overall electrification of the segment by lowering the cost at which the benefits of electrification can be achieved.

HCVs least lend themselves to electrification as they tend to be used for heavy duty, long haul trucking. Some companies are currently looking at ways through which this task could be electrified, but for the segment as a whole this still seems a long way out. However, the Paris Accord will have implications for emissions standards in the countries that have signed up to it, and the HCV segment of Commercial Vehicles in particular will be challenged by this as it is one of the largest contributors to overall emissions. At a minimum, this will drive a focus on fuel efficiency in the segment, which would have as a consequence that going forward, oil demand from HCVs will continue to grow in line with economic growth but at an overall lower pace than what has been experienced in the past 15 years. Another yet less likely possibility is that the segment shifts from diesel to alternate fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid natural gas (LNG), which some companies at least are already betting on will happen.

Aviation Trends

Aviation is a bright spot when it comes to future oil demand, as the segment is expected to double over the next two decades. At a substantial 2.5 percent annually, growth in Europe is forecasted to be the slowest of all the world’s regions. The Asia Pacific region will add the most new flyers, with China expected to add 817 million passengers a year by 2035, India 322 million, Indonesia 135 million and Vietnam 112 million. The United States is expected to add 484 million passengers a year by 2035.

Electrification of aviation is not expected before at least another 20 years, which means that the growth in aviation will be a strong driver for oil demand growth.

Marine Trends

Oil demand related to marine has over the past 75 years benefitted greatly from the globalization trend. Since the 1950s the growth rate of international trade has almost consistently been twice that of economic activity as a whole. From 2000 to 2008 world trade increased by an average 5.4 percent each year, while economic activity increased by only 3 percent. Marine transport has consequently seen massive growth.

Since 2015, however, the IMF has been warning that the prospect for global growth is, at best, “mediocre”, which would seriously undermine Marine’s ability to continue to drive oil demand upwards.

A further risk for Marine’s ability to continue to drive oil demand is the populism trend in politics. This has the potential of forcing globalization into reverse (which according to some has already happened), namely, through economic policies that switch focus towards regionalization or even localization of manufacturing (“America First”).

Most important for Marine’s ability to continue to drive oil demand is the International Marine Organization’s (IMO) recent tightening of the sulphur limit for marine bunker fuel. This requirement could be met through adjustments to the refining process used for the production of bunker fuel (hydrotreating, requiring investment from the refiners), or installation of “scrubbers” on board vessels to remove sulphur from the exhaust fumes (requiring investments from the ship owners). A third option is to switch Marine from oil based bunker fuels to LNG. Some of the biggest players in the LNG industry are pushing for this switch, through investments in LNG-fueling stations in ports around the world, hoping it will enable them to remove some of the supply glut LNG is currently facing. In the short term a majority of the existing vessel fleet will most likely opt for the purchasing of ultra-low sulphur bunker fuel or the installation of scrubbers in order to meet the new marine fuel bunker regulations. Vessels currently under design could more easily opt for the LNG options, however, which means that medium to longer term LNG powered vessels should be expected to become more common.

The most optimistic outlook for Marine associated oil demand is therefore continued growth, but at a substantially lower level than during the past 15 years due to lower global economic growth and the beginnings of fuel substitution.

Other Industry Trend

The Paris Climate Accord also poses a substantial challenge for energy intensive industries such as steel, aluminum, cement and paper. In order to deliver on the targets defined in the Paris Accord these industries will have to switch from “higher carbon fuels” such as coal and oil to natural gas, while at the same time implementing new technologies that substantially improve energy efficiency, as processes that are truly “zero carbon”, such as those based on hydrogen or renewable electricity, are not yet realistic alternatives.

This will be no small feat to achieve, however, as in many cases these changes require significant – and thus expensive – retrofits to existing plants. Also holding back these investments is what could be called “first mover disadvantage”, i.e. the first to implement the necessary changes will also be the first one to incur the costs, resulting in a disadvantage in the international market place.

For practical reasons oil demand from industries such as steel, aluminum, cement and paper should therefore be expected to continue to grow in line with overall economic growth.

Petrochemical Trends

Over the past 50 years plastics usage has increased twenty-fold, closely linked to economic growth. If this trend were to continue, plastics usage would double again in the next 20 years, driving up demand for both natural gas and refined oil products (Naphtha, LPG).

Behind these growth numbers is a global habit of use-and-dump when it comes to plastics. It is estimated that 8,300 million metric tons (Mt) have been produced over the years. 6,300 Mt of these are no longer in use, of which just 9 percent has been recycled. This use-and-dump has become an issue on a global scale. The realization that if left unaddressed, by 2050 the world’s oceans would contain more dumped plastics than fish, has lead to a number of trends that will affect plastics demand growth.

One of these trends is the substitution effect. Consumers are looking for sustainable alternatives over hydrocarbon based plastics, and governments are beginning to discourage or even prohibit the use of plastics in cases where plastics use can easily substituted (such as for example in the case of shopping bags in China and The Netherlands). Clearly, this trend will negatively affect impact plastics demand growth.

Another trend with regard to plastics is sustainable manufacturing. In response to the substitution trend amongst consumers, producers are looking at more sustainable ways to produce plastics. The so-called bioplastics niche of the petrochemical industry, in which plastics are produced from renewable feedstocks instead of crude oil derivatives or natural gas, has been one of its fastest growing sectors and is projected to maintain this pace.

For plastics the general concern about sustainability will probably also mean continued growth in recycling, which in and off itself would not impact plastics demand but would impact the oil demand resulting from demand.

All this has lead some analysts to conclude that plastics associated oil demand might have already peaked, i.e. that the petrochemical industry will not be driving further oil demand growth. A more conservative view is that plastics associated oil demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, but at a slower pace than heretofore.

Power Generation Trends

Oil or oil derivatives based electricity generation is amongst the most costly ways to produce electricity. For this reason the share of electricity produced from oil sources has decreased steadily since at least 1960. Today oil or oil derivatives based electricity generation makes up just 4 percent of global electricity generation. Related: Falling Chinese Demand May Be OPEC’s Biggest Dilemma

Technological progress has made wind and solar energy a viable option for ever more regions of the world. In many parts of the world wind and solar can now cost-compete with coal and natural gas, traditionally the lowest cost feedstocks for power generation, as a consequence of which many of the countries that have a dependency on oil or oil derivatives for power generation are moving forward with plans to remove this dependency.

Power generation will therefore not be driving oil demand. Rather, it should be expected to reduce oil demand.

Overall Assessment

It is hard to deny that the electrification of transport, consumer environmental concern and the implications of the Paris Accord are severe challenges for the oil industry. Nevertheless, many have argued that oil demand will continue to grow. A segmental, trend-based-analysis of future oil demand shows this expectation is highly doubtful since essentially all segments are experiencing trends that will adversely affect their oil demand. For some these trends are more acute (transportation related demand) than for other (industry related demand), but they are there for all.

This means, firstly, that it is most likely that oil demand growth will soon break with the past and start a new trajectory, where it first slows down (2020s), then disappears (2030s), and ultimately shoots into fast reverse (2040s). And secondly, that there will be substantial shifts in the product-composition of oil demand (diesel versus gasoline versus jet fuel, et cetera).

Of course, if global growth were to break with its recent past and suddenly pick up again, and implementation of the Paris Accord is delayed, and the consumer concern about the environment and enthusiasm for electric vehicles were to fade away, oil demand could continue its past growth path for another two decades. But how realistic are these assumptions?

In 1979, in the throes of the U.S. energy crisis, then President Jimmy Carter addressed the nation as he installed 32 solar panels designed to use the Sun’s energy to heat water. He told the country, “A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.”

Former President Carter’s vision for clean, renewable energy proved to be far ahead of his time.

While his successor, former President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed, Carter and his family have continued their work toward ensuring that those 32 panels became a part of a much bigger story.

Carter leased 10 acres of land in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, to be used as a solar farm. This February, the solar development firm SolAmerica finally completed the project, which will have the capacity to meet more than half of the town’s energy needs.

This is, in essence, one action taken by one man…and it is powering half a town.

Then, in June of this year, the Carter family had 324 solar panels installed on the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, which will provide about seven percent of the library’s power.

The Power of People

“Distributed, clean energy generation is critical to meeting growing energy needs around the world while fighting the effects of climate change,” Carter said in a SolAmerica press release. “I am encouraged by the tremendous progress that solar and other clean energy solutions have made in recent years and expect those trends to continue.”

Carter’s continued activism in support of renewables showcases the importance of local and individual efforts to reduce humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels, even in the absence of strong national initiatives.

We, the people, have power.

The solar farm in Plains is expected to generate 1.3 MW of power per year, which is equal to burning about 3,600 tons of coal. Over time, that will prevent a sizable amount of greenhouse gases from being emitted into our atmosphere.

Many individuals, communities, and even states are joining with Carter in working toward shifting to clean energy sources. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has invested in developing technology and products that are making solar energy cheaper than ever before. The U.S. states of New York, California, and Washington have banded together to form the “United States Climate Alliance” after President Donald Trump announced the country would pull out of the Paris Climate Accord.

These are just a few examples of people and communities who are working towards a sustainable future. And their work is bearing fruit — the construction of coal power plants is declining worldwide, and a new report projects that the U.S. will exceed its Paris Accord goals despite the recent withdraw. Regardless of the opposition, people around the world are choosing to embark on exciting adventure to a bright, renewable (and clean) tomorrow.

The future is looking bright."

The British automaker isn’t having any of it.

Despite earlier reports to the contrary, Mini has no immediate plans to diversify its current lineup, preferring to wait until the next-generation Mini rolls along before going nuts (if indeed it ever does). In the meantime, are you interested in a crossover or near-crossover?

The automaker confirmed to Top Gear that the existing two-and four-door Cooper, Convertible, Clubman and Countryman will remain the only animals in the Mini stable until early next decade. That’s when a fourth-generation Cooper should appear, possibly with new siblings.

By turning off the lights in the product development room, Mini has shattered hopes of anyone getting their hands on a production Superleggera Roadster. That would-be model bowed in 2014 as a svelte electric concept vehicle. Also off the table is a two-seat micro Mini, first envisioned as the 2011 Rocketman concept.

But hey, who’s interested in a John Cooper Works Countryman?

Mini made headlines last year after its vice-president of product development, Ralph Mahler, suggested a small sedan would make good business sense in high-volume markets. That immediately drew cries of disgust from Peter Schwarzenbauer, the BMW Group board member in charge of the brand. While he said he couldn’t rule it out, Schwarzenbauer said the thought of a sedan residing among Mini’s ranks caused him to fear for the brand’s identity.

According to a company source who spoke with Top Gear, the economics weren’t working in favor of either the Rocketman or Superleggera. Even if fitted with a conventional powerplant, the sports car market remains too niche for Mini to bother with. As well, a two-seater mini Mini wouldn’t actually be that much smaller than the existing Cooper.

The other end of the market — the large, spacious, all-wheel-drive end — doesn’t have the same profit margin issues as the small side, though few would argue the Countryman is a key part of the brand’s heritage.

In this footage, Russia’s most advanced tactical aircraft are firing live weapons just offshore, staged explosions are set off, and Russian armor pours out of massive Ropucha (Toad) class landing beach craft . Panstir-S point air defense systems are also seen guarding over the beachhead, and Russia’s feared Bastion-P coastal defense system is shown in action.

Some of this looks more like a dog-and-pony show than a realistic tactical scenario (Su-34s dumping flares into the ocean on unison etc.) but still it is a pretty awesome sight and a reminder of the heavy-hitting albeit blunt military capabilities Russia has at its disposal.

Crimea was a part of the Ukraine before Russia invaded it in 2014, and this show of force must be very unnerving for the Ukraine military. The majority of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and a number of other air and land assets have been forward deployed to the Crimea for the better part of a century, and remained there following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But Russia has drastically increased its military presence in Crimea since seizing it two years ago. This includes a steady modernization of the Black Sea Fleet, much of which is based in Sevastopol, and the deployment of some of the most advanced combat aircraft and missile systems in Russia’s inventory, including the S-400 Triumf SAM system."

Spare a thought for your car’s brake pads

Drivers rarely give much thought to their car’s braking system. Yet it is one of the most important safety features of any car.

Whether slowing in stop-start commuter traffic or using brakes to their maximum potential, when driving at a track day, who doesn’t take them for granted?

It’s only when the local garage mechanic advises that parts need replacing, or worse still, a red warning light illuminates on the dashboard, that we will stop and ponder the braking system. And that’s also when the cost of having parts replaced, such as the brake pads, comes into sharp focus.

However, changing brake pads is a relatively simple job that anyone with a modest ability for DIY should be able to safely accomplish. And if you already own most of the basic tools needed to perform the job, it will save you a few bob in garage costs and give a glowing sense of satisfaction, too. Here, the experts from Haynes explain how to do it.



How brake pads work

Brake pads are designed to work with a car’s brake discs, or rotors, to slow it down. They are installed in brake callipers and are pushed against the discs by pistons, which are in turn moved by brake fluid that is pressurised by a master cylinder.

When a driver pushes the brake pedal, the master cylinder compresses the fluid which in turn moves the pistons to ease the pads against the discs.

Some cars have brake pad wear indicators, which illuminate a light on the dashboard when the pads have worn down to a set limit. Most pads don’t, though, so the only way of telling how worn a pad is is to examine the level of fluid in the brake fluid reservoir (which drops as the pad wears) or to take the wheel off and inspect the material remaining on the pad.



Why you should change your car’s brake pads

Brake pads are critical components for the safe operation of your car, and should be maintained correctly to avoid a potential disaster. If the pads wear down completely you’ll not only damage the discs, which are expensive to replace, but may be unable to stop the car in time and cause a crash.

Each wheel has at least two pads and it’s important to change the pads on both front wheels at the same time, to ensure an even brake force across the pair of wheels.

At the same time you should examine the condition of the discs and look for signs of wear, or more serious scoring or corrosion, and have them replaced if needed.



When to change your brake pads

It’s important that your front brake pads are examined whenever the car is serviced and replaced when necessary. Modern cars typically require an annual inspection, or 18 months for longer service intervals.

If you hear unpleasant squealing when using the brakes, all may not be well with the pads. It is most likely caused by a small metal shim that is designed to make contact with the brake disc as the pad reaches the end of its serviceable life, warning the driver that it’s time to replace the pads.

Equally, if the car is pulling to one side of the road noticeably, when braking in a straight line on a flat, level road surface without camber, all may not be well with the brakes.

Brake pads may also have a sensor that activates a dashboard warning light when the pad has worn down, but not all models have these. So open the bonnet and inspect the level of the brake fluid in the reservoir. It drops as the pads wear, so can be a useful indicator of when pads need replacing.

Next, jack up the front of the car — see our guide on how to safely to this — remove the front wheels and examine the pads directly.

If there is less than 3mm of pad depth remaining, it’s time to change them.

All cars are slightly different, so you should consult the vehicle handbook, or use a Haynes manual for the relevant make and model.

Entrepreneur First (EF), the London-headquartered company builder that invests in individuals “pre-team, pre-idea” to help create new technology startups, has raised $12.4 million in new funding led by Silicon Valley’s Greylock Partners.

The investment also sees Greylock partner and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman join the board. In a call, Hoffman described EF as an incubation model that “contradicts common wisdom,” and exactly the sort of idea he seeks to back.

Other investors joining the round include Mosaic Ventures (I understand Mosaic’s Toby Coppel first introduced Hoffman to EF), Founders Fund, Lakestar Capital and Deep Mind founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman.

Notable is that a number of EF alumni are also investing. They are Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang of Magic Pony Technology — the AI startup sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and the company builder’s only financially significant exit to date — and Bryan Baum, who co-founded Represent, which was sold for a reported $100 million but went through the program before EF insisted on taking a stake in the companies it helps create.

It should also be noted that the new funding round is for operational costs and to further scale the EF program. In other words, it is entirely separate from the company builder’s investment fund from which it directly invests in the founders and startups it helps create. Therefore, this is more akin to EF as a startup in its own right raising funding.

The ability to create a portfolio of great entrepreneurship and great companies is something I treat as a personal mission Reid Hoffman

Founded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, EF bills itself as a “talent first” investor that targets the best technical and domain talent in Europe and Singapore — both recent graduates and also people already working at tech companies — and invites them to apply to its six-month program where they find co-founders and in turn found startups.

The EF program includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider U.K. and Singapore startup scene. There’s also a separate follow-on fund to co-invest in alumni companies at the seed and Series A stage.

The idea is to help talented individuals become entrepreneurs, and companies be founded, that otherwise might not. To date, EF says it has helped more than 500 individuals on its program, who have built more than 100 companies with a total (mostly on paper) valuation exceeding $1 billion.

“Even though I don’t like to invest outside of Silicon Valley, the ability to create a portfolio of great entrepreneurship and great companies is something I treat as a personal mission,” Hoffman tells me, noting that Bentinck and Clifford have created a “great model for creating new, deep tech companies on an incubation basis.”

“I think where it’s helpful is when you have depth of tech talent, creativity, an interest in creating companies but an as yet only partially developed entrepreneurial culture,” he says when asked why a model like EF is needed outside Silicon Valley. (Separately, Clifford tells me EF has no plans to expand to the U.S.)

I recount how in EF’s early days — albeit before it was anything like proven — a number of VCs I spoke to had doubts the company builder’s “pre-team, pre-idea” model could work. Hoffman sounds unsurprised.

“The number of incubators and accelerators that have failed is huge,” he says, “so what happens is that most VCs tend to be ‘look, the real entrepreneurs are just willing to go and do it themselves,’ and I would say that is common sense wisdom. Common sense wisdom has a breadth of truth to it, [but] I like to look at where the common sense wisdom has a limitation and where there is a big opportunity.”

Hoffman says he can easily see “a universe in which there’s 20 or 30 or 40 cities, maybe even 50, where Entrepreneur First is integral to creating a set of interesting tech companies in those areas.” “You can reach scale if you get the formula right,” he argues, pointing to how Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator has grown in the last decade.

So why hasn’t anyone cloned EF’s model verbatim? Clifford says it’s partly network effects — a program like EF becomes more valuable the more quality founders and companies it adds — and whilst Reid doesn’t dispute this, the answer may be even simpler.

“The reason why they haven’t been copied yet is that people don’t have a full recognition of the really interesting thing that Entrepreneur First is doing,” he says. “And of course they try to keep some of the secret sauce under the covers, too.”

Before I wrap up our call, I turn the subject to the thorny issue of Brexit. Given that a large part of EF’s current program takes place in London but attracts applicants from all over Europe, was the U.K.’s decision to vote to leave the EU a consideration before Greylock decided to invest?

“I definitely thought about it,” says Hoffman. “The impact will I think be relatively harsh over the next five or 10 years, starting with the fact that I think people are under the illusion that there is an easy divorce from the EU.”

With that said — and factoring in that we don’t yet know what a post-Brexit world will look like — he reckons there’s still “easily enough headroom” in the U.K. to create world transforming companies."
https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/14/yahoo-brings-esports-coverage-to-mobile-with-launch-of-new-app/,pos,0.9999999999995272,4.381758848257922e-13,Yahoo brings eSports coverage to mobile with launch of new app – TechCrunch,2016-04-14 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:25:56.984381,Sarah Perez,"Yahoo has recently been trimming down its digital media business, with the closure of several of its online magazines, but other verticals – including eSports – are still seeing investment. To that end, the company has now launched its first eSports mobile application on Android. The new app brings eSports match coverage, including the ability to watch live or replay past games, view live stats, and more to your smartphone.

The launch follows the March debut of the Yahoo Esports content site, which operates under the larger Yahoo Sports Media group.

The site is meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to the eSports industry, featuring reporting, video commentaries, match pages, rosters, stats, schedules, scores, and more – similar to what Yahoo offers for its other sports coverage areas. Currently, Yahoo largely focuses on top titles, including “League of Legends,” “Dota 2,” “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” “Heroes of the Storm,” and “Street Fighter V,” though the company said more titles would arrive in time.

However, that expansion has not yet come to pass in time for the mobile launch – today, those games are still the only ones featured in the Yahoo eSports application.

In addition to coverage, stats and commentary, the app will also support push notifications in order to deliver alerts about your favorite events and games, as well as breaking news, tournament analysis, and competitive strategy.

Yahoo’s eSports editors including Andrea Rene, Travis Gafford, Taylor Cocke, Dylan Walker and Michael Martin, who have backgrounds from IGN, GameSport, Kotaku, GameStop TV, and more, will be creating content for the new app.

The expansion into the eSports arena comes at a time when the industry is growing rapidly – the global audience for eSports in 2015 was more than 226 million, Yahoo previously noted when launching the new online destination.

Yahoo, of course, is not the only big media giant trying to edge its way into eSports – earlier this year, ESPN also launched a new division to focus on eSports coverage. This move arrived after ESPN’s increasing interest in the space. It had recently aired tournaments on its ESPN2 and ESPN3 channels, including the final of the “Heroes of the Dorm” event (a collegiate tournament for “Heroes of the Storm”), as well as The International, the tournament for Dota 2.

Amazon, via Twitch, and Google, via YouTube Gaming (and its accompanying Android integration), are also competing in this broader gaming space.

The Yahoo eSports Android application is live now, and the iOS launch is arriving soon, the company says."

Capability Set One (CS1) being a light helicopter, all the way up to Capability Set Five (CS5) being a heavy lift cargo aircraft. In the center is CS3, which will theoretically become the replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk and the AH-64 Apache, and also possibly the USMC's UH-1 and AH-1 fleets, among other helicopters. Currently this part of the FVL is the highest priority overall for the program, and CS3 isn't scheduled to be procured till around 2030 —if the funds for such a large force featuring capabilities that are currently deemed as ""exotic"" materializes.

During this year's Army Aviation Association of America convention, Army aviation officials stressed that the biggest gap in capability they have is the one left by the Kiowa Warrior's quick retirement, and that they are seeking to fill that gap as a top priority. As it previously sat, the Army wouldn't be able to replace the Kiowa Warrior anytime soon, as the service remained focused on developing and procuring a scalable family of new helicopter systems dubbed Future Vertical Lift.

By the turn of the decade it looked as if the Kiowa Warrior would get its first major facelift in over two decades in the form of the OH-58F program. The upgraded Kiowa Warrior first flew in 2013 and it was planned to reach initial operating capability in 2016, with the entire fleet of OH-58Ds being slated for the upgrade. The type would fly in ""Foxtrot"" form till at least 2036, but likely even beyond. Then the end came as the Army enacted its rotary-wing aviation restructuring plan, and the Kiowa's proud service came to a fairly abrupt and unglamorous end.

In between these programs the Army kicked the tires on many other armed reconnaissance helicopter concepts, but none made it very far. Even upgrading the OH-58D significantly was a touch-and-go affair before the type was suddenly axed entirely.

The Army's bumbling of the often step-child like but highly effective armed scout helicopter program and community is nothing new. The service has failed to field a OH-58D replacement for nearly a decade and a half. Before its cancellation in 2004, the cutting-edge and stealthy RAH-66 Comanche was supposedly going to fill the role and more. Then the Army went for a far lower-end replacement with the ARH-70 Arapaho program that also failed after costs spiraled out of control and developmental issues persisted.

Under the same aviation plan, the OH-58D was partially ""replaced"" by far more complex and expensive AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters and drones , with the hopes that the Apache-drone teaming would work like a charm. Well the concept is still floundering, and clearly it cannot replace the efficiency or capability that the Kiowa Warrior provided. Not just that, but the plan also has seen entry-level Army helicopter pilots being taught to fly on $5 million twin turbine medium utility helicopters—the equivalent of running a drivers ed classes in a brand new Lexus SUV.

The US Army has executed its grand rotary-wing aviation restructuring plan that saw the ousting of hundreds of Bell JetRanger derivatives from service— 653 airframes in total . These included the Army's entire fleet of 187 TH-67 Creek primary trainers and the roughly 340 OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance/armed scout helicopters that performed so brilliantly in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, just months after the final Kiowa Warriors were officially retired, the US Army is whining about how badly they need...an armed scout helicopter.

But the Army now seems to being interested in pushing forward with a CS1 design on its own, possibly outside the official multi-service JVL program. The Sikorsky S-97 Raider was originally viewed as yet another possible successor to the OH-58D—that is before sequestration hit. It is currently in flight testing and offers many additional capabilities that the OH-58D didn't—such as the ability to haul six troops into combat—and in some ways, it would even eclipse the utility of the AH-64 Apache for a portion of the Army's more kinetically oriented missions. Its speed gives it enhanced survivability, faster response times to emergency troops in contact calls, superior anti-access capabilities and enhanced sortie rates among other benefits. It is even rumored to have some low observable features, although it can't be considered a ""stealth"" aircraft.

Both Sikorsky-Boeing, with their pusher-prop X-2 and S-97 Raider derived configuration dubbed the SB-1 Defiant, and Bell with their revised tiltrotor setup dubbed the V-280 Valor are the primary competitors vying for what could be the most high-stakes helicopter competition of a generation. Although both types are CS3 aircraft, it's the ""densest"" category of the FVL lot when it comes to potential airframe sales. So the winning technology for CS3 is likely to factor in heavily, if not totally when it comes to the Pentagon's decisions on other FVL capability set needs. A flight demonstration phase will begin by the end of the decade with both the V-280 and SB-1 airframes acting as competing technology demonstrators.

Army officials state that affordability must key if they are going to move forward and try to fill the hole left by the OH-58D in the not so distant future. This is somewhat of a laughable concept considering the service basically threw away hundreds of economical helicopters they already owned outright which were still capable of the armed scout mission. Nonetheless, while FVL will highly depend on scalability across as many services as possible for each aircraft capability set category cooperatively procured—for instance would the USMC want a CS2 or CS3 design to replace their attack helicopters, and if they go for a lighter and cheaper CS2 aircraft, maybe the US Army would follow suit—an Army armed scout replacement initiative would likely travel on its own vertical track. This way there would be no need for a ""wait and see"" mentality in regards to finding out other services' needs and wishes, or for FVL to mature as a program at all. As a result, if the funding materializes, an armed scout helicopter replacement could happen relatively quickly. But once again, getting the funding to do so is about as big of an if as it gets right now.

US Army AH-64 and OH-58D over Iraq.

All this seems to be happening with little reflection as to what caused this capability gap in the first place. Specifically that it was partially self imposed as part of a highly questionable scheme that many predicted would end exactly how it has—with a glaring capability gap. If the Kiowa Warriors were kept and given some focused upgrades so that they could last even another decade, a replacement could have been procured based on far more mature FVL associated technologies. Not just that, but the Army would not be flying a fleet of twin engine utility UH-72 Lakota helicopters as trainers, nor would they need to have procured 100 more to augment the 87 existing airframes that were ordered to be ported over to the training role as part of the plan.

DoD The UH-72 is now laughably the Army's primary trainer at Fort Rucker.

Supposedly there have been some minor benefits associated with using the UH-72 for the training mission, but it seems very unlikely they outweigh the high cost of procuring and operating these relatively large and complex helicopters in such a basic role. Really, the Army could have executed other parts of its rotary-wing restructuring program—which included moving attack helicopters from the Guard to the active force, and Black Hawks from the active force to the Guard—while leaving the OH-58 and TH-67 alone. Additionally, if the Pentagon and the services under its purview would finally grow up and look at their assets in a holistic manner, a portion of the UH-72s could have been ported over to the USAF to replace its relatively ancient UH-1N missile tenders and VIP helicopters. In fact, the same 87 airframes sent to Fort Rucker to provide training, probably would have done the trick. The upside to all this is that if the Army could come up with some serious funds to procure a new advanced armed scout helicopter, Sikorsky has been self-funding development of the S-97 raider for years, so the Army would be stepping in later in the Raider's development process than it would have otherwise. And if given the chance, the aircraft could even prove itself so indispensable that it may even be able to pull from other Army aviation budget pales, including the traditionally highly guarded funds set aside for its attack helicopter force.

Sikorsky The company is already working on different configurations for the S-97 via a series of kits. They are also examining the possibility of an unmanned and stealthy Raider drone.

Special Operations Command (SOCOM) could also potentially get involved with the S-97 program if ""big Army"" blazes the way. The type seems extremely well suited for the intense demands of the famed 160th Special Operations Air Regiment (SOAR), and could partially or fully replace the MH-6 and AH-6 Little Bird, as well as the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator. The more participation in the program the more the unit cost could decline and it could also actually lower risk for the Future Vertical Lift program in the coming decade as a byproduct.

He Is Based In Ny.,"Virtual reality: the wild west; the new frontier; the land of opportunity. Barons, cowboys, outlaws and gunslingers all vying for their voice by rushing for content gold in this unbridled sphere of influence — but they are stumbling in the thicket of the emigrant trails. The path to creating virtual reality content has been identified, but has yet to be defined. Manifest Destiny.

Welcome to the evolution of story. The future of content creation and consumption. This is the proving ground and battleground for thinkers and tinkerers. The power has shifted to favor the entrepreneurial creators, both engineers and storytellers, who understand the complexities of a 360 degree universe — though few exist.

At first use, the viewer is momentarily fascinated by the virtual experience, but the content struggles to ignite and elicit lasting emotion. This is a sophisticated audience that processes multiple streams of information faster than ever before, and craves a deeper connection to the content that can be shared across social profiles.

The virtual experience is the new theatrical experience, whereby the 21st century viewer is unable to distract themselves with the second (and third, and fourth) screen. Here exists an outlet to control and capture their undivided attention. A new means for escapism.

But with this newfound power, storytellers must create a new form of media that completely immerses and entertains the viewer for the duration of the story’s exhibition. Herein lies the problem. Storytellers are riddled with the challenge of defining story and creating truly compelling content in virtual reality’s current state of nascence.

Conflation peppers the storyteller’s ideology in 360 video and virtual reality. The general public, and many virtual reality evangelizers and practitioners, do not differentiate the distinctions between 360 video and virtual reality. They are two distinct mediums.

360 video is virtual reality’s gateway drug, and is becoming ubiquitous with the Google Cardboard and Facebook’s promotion of the format. 360 video serves to ramp up consumer adoption in the market, lowering the barrier to entry, but will veer into its own niche as virtual reality and augmented reality advancements marginalize and cannibalize the medium.

Once storytellers existentially define their audience’s relationship to their content, they focus on the fundamental ethics and dramatic arc of their story.

In 360 video, multi-camera rigs (often stagnant) are utilized to record live action in a 360 degree realm, which gives the consumer a contained perspective to a location and its subjects. Virtual reality renders a world in which the consumer essentially operates as a natural extension of the creator’s environment, moving beyond 360 video, by enabling the viewer to explore and/or manipulate a malleable space.

In 360 video, the consumer functions as a passenger in the storyteller’s world; in virtual reality, the consumer takes the wheel. The storyteller directs the viewer’s gaze through this situational content by using elemental cues, such as light, sound and stage movement. The traditional notion of the fourth wall has been eliminated. 360 video and virtual reality present untapped storytelling models that are encapsulated by metaphysical qualities: existence and influence.

The rivers of Existence and Influence each diverge at separate deltas. For Existence, the viewer’s experience can be defined as Observant or Participant. For Influence, the experience is either Active or Passive.

In an Observant model, the viewer does not inherit a rigid identity within the story. Presence is only granted through the ability to observe the story, so the viewer remains in a non-existent state outside of the story. While this has been the status quo for the majority of filmed entertainment, its applications in 360 video and virtual reality inject newfound complexity into the viewer’s relationship to the content.

In its counterpart, the Participant model, the viewer’s identity is recognized within the universe of the story. This identity does not have to resemble the story’s predominant characters, but its existence is inextricable from the story itself. The virtual universe of the story responds to, and can be motivated by, the viewer’s digital existence.

In the Active model, the viewer is given a share of the storyteller’s power to affect the outcome of the story’s events. In this democratic mode of storytelling, the storyteller presents carefully measured and calculated choices to the viewer. Once made, these choices influence the story’s progression. The means of yielding optionality to the viewer converts the virtual experience into an interactive playing field, thus emboldening the content with causality.

In a Passive model, the storyteller maintains autocratic power. The traditional storyteller’s school of thought prevails, where the viewer is relegated to a rudderless vessel in the passage of the storyteller’s universe.

As seen in the above Punnett Square, Existence and Influence converge in four possible combinations: Observant Active, Observant Passive, Participant Active and Participant Passive.

Observant Active

Observant Active reimagines the experience by bestowing God-like decision-making power upon the viewer. The Active aspect is limited by a predetermined set of choices (nodes) laid out by the storyteller, by which the storyteller has construed a variety of outcomes. This already functions in certain forms of digital media, as seen in the increasing popularity of “choose your own adventure” types of stories.

In 360 video, the consumer functions as a passenger; in virtual reality, the consumer takes the wheel.

To employ this technique, the storyteller explicitly intrudes on the user experience through freeze frames, narration, subtitles and annotations. Or, the storyteller covertly empowers the viewer’s gaze to follow a specific character’s journey. The storyteller controls an expository dialogue with the viewer.

Some examples include Yoni Bloch’s Pretend to Be Happy, in which the non-existent viewer renders change within the story through thoughtfully placed graphic overlays. Glen Keane’s Duet employs a more subtle approach, as the viewer’s gaze dictates the progression of the narrative.

Observant Passive

Observant Passive has long been the standard model for filmed content. The viewer does not exist in the story’s universe, and cannot impose any influence on its events. The viewer simply watches dramatic or comedic events unfold in a procedural manner. As such, the storyteller retains complete control of the action and information presented to the viewer.

The history of film is predicated on this philosophy of storytelling. Observant Passive content easily crosses over into 360 video and virtual reality, as seen in Gabo Arora, Barry Pousman and Chris Milk’s Clouds Over Sidra, and Mac Cauley’s The Night Cafe. It does not imply the viewer’s digital presence or give the viewer any influence over the story.

Participant Active

Participant Active features a transformative combination of Existence and Influence. The viewer both exists in the world as a character or story device, and has influence over the experienced story. The universe acknowledges and addresses Existence, as the viewer interacts with the world and is bound by its laws and underlying story.

A character has the ability to go off on a tangent, but the story will reset, adapt or evolve based upon certain parameters. These parameters can vary according to the storyteller’s intended structure (rigid versus free form).

Samsung and Ustwo’s Land’s End presents a minimalistic take on the viewer’s interaction with story, and as a character within it. Participant Active has flourished in the arena of video games, like Grand Theft Auto, in which the user’s digital persona evolves within and along the universe of the game.

Participant Passive

Participant Passive is a relatively new form of story in which the viewer exists in the world as a character, or a story device, but the story does not ask anything of the viewer, or permit them to inform the course of events. The viewer functions as a silent bystander, or pure-recipient of action.

The definition can be muddled if we were to look at films like Annie Hall or House of Cards. In both, the protagonist breaks the fourth wall by opening up a line of dialogue to (not with) the audience. When Frank Underwood turns to the camera, he addresses the indistinct audience, not the viewer as a character or a story device within his world.

The Participant Passive quadrant provides ample room for experimentation. For example, the viewer could toggle vantage points or perspectives in a crowd while watching Godzilla destroy a city.

360 video and virtual reality push the viewer into a symbiotic relationship with the story.

Sidney Lumet’s film 12 Angry Men comes to mind as interesting material for adaptation, if the viewer were to be imagined as a juror who lacks free will and narrative voice. Ilya Naishuller’s first person POV high-octane action film Hardcore has the main actor billed as “you” the viewer. In Guy Shelmerdine’s Catatonic, the viewer inhabits a wheelchair-bound patient being pushed around the psychiatric wing of a 1940s-era hospital. In Supergravity and Terror Film’s The Chosen 360 video experience, the viewer is strapped to a chair while paranormal events unfold in the room.

Once storytellers existentially define their audience’s relationship to their content, they focus on the fundamental ethics and dramatic arc of their story. Their creative choices ultimately provide intrinsic meaning to the content, which can be individually inferred by the viewer’s perception.

360 video and virtual reality push the viewer into a symbiotic relationship with the story, providing a sense of agency and perspective that deviates from a century of cinematic consumption. In either the proximity to the characters and story, or the influence over the story, the viewer of the future will be required to engage with the content with unprecedented emotional connection and commitment.

This heightened exchange between storyteller and consumer necessitates further exploration and refinement, fueling ideation and creation of content, be it user-generated or studio-produced.

The 360 video and virtual reality creators are wildly inspired to prospect, discover and question the language of storytelling. This is the analog age, where early developments in story will transform the novelty of the virtual experience into authentic adoption. Consumers will then actively seek out the medium for elevated content, paving the path for creators to shape their definition of story in 360 video and virtual reality.

Virtual reality’s inherent grandeur is invention in story; a digression of theatre, not onscreen, but within screen."

The Orionid meteor shower is happening this weekend. It produces some of the brightest meteors all year.

The most meteors will fall between Oct. 20-22. Expect to see between 10-30 meteors an hour. The best time to spot them is around 1:30 am each night.

By this time, the Moon will have set. Its absence provides darker skies to enjoy the show. But watch out for the weather.

Cloudy skies will be rolling across the US this weekend. Here are the best and worst places to watch on Oct 20, 21, and 22.

What makes the Orionids so special is where they come from. They're actually debris from the famous Halley's Comet.

For the best show, find a safe, dark place away from city lights. Many meteors will appear to come from the Orion constellation.

But experts advise to look away from Orion. That way, you'll spot the meteors with the longest tails. Happy meteor hunting!"

SAO PAULO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Banco Santander Brasil SA beat its profitability target in the third quarter as the nation's economic recovery allowed it to expand loans to retail clients faster than expected.

Return on equity (ROE) at the Brazilian unit of Spain's Banco Santander SA came in at 17.1 percent, far above the 15.8 percent target set for 2018, Chief Financial Officer Angel Santodomingo told analysts on a conference call on Thursday.

Chief Executive Officer Sérgio Rial told reporters at a separate news conference: ""We are on our way to reaching profitability similar of large Brazilian private banks"".

The bank's ROE handily surpassed the consensus estimate of 14.6 percent compiled by Thomson Reuters, but still lags larger rivals. Brazil's No. 1 lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA , for example, has posted ROE above 21 percent over the last two quarters.

Santander Brasil will revise its profitability guidance by the end of next year, Rial said.

The bank earned a net 2.58 billion reais ($798 million) in the third quarter when adjusted for one-off items, 11 percent higher than the prior three months and above a consensus estimate of 2.38 billion reais.

A nascent recovery from the deepest recession in a century helped it expand its loan book at faster-than-expected pace, to 262.9 billion reais.

In a report, Itaú BBA analysts called the loan book growth ""outstanding"" as the bank focused on the more profitable retail segment, which helped lift net interest income. Household loans increased 5 percent over the previous quarter, whereas the corporate loan book shrank 1.4 percent.

Loan-loss provision expenses rose 2.9 percent in the third quarter, mostly because of specific corporate clients, but remained below consensus estimates. Delinquency rates declined slightly.

Units in Santander Brasil, a blend of one preferred and one common share that is its most widely traded class of stock, were down 0.8 percent at 30.60 reais on Thursday morning, reducing this year's gains to 9.7 percent.

The term “dress for success” need not apply when you can roll out of bed and be on duty in a minute or less.

I work from home, and I confess that my yoga pants serve as both my workout and work attire. I like to be comfortable while I write, but is my relaxed dress impacting my work? The short answer is “yes.” Researchers Joy V. Peluchette and Katherine Karl conducted a study that was published in Human Resource Development Quarterly, and found that participants reported feeling more authoritative, trustworthy, and competent when wearing formal business attire. Mason Donovan, author of The Golden Apple: Redefining Work-Life Balance for a Diverse Workforce, agrees that clothing affects your work: “Although a dress code may seem silly when you think about working from home, work clothes impact you on a business and personal level and can affect your career,” he says. “It’s a physical and visual distinction, and it helps me set boundaries. Otherwise you could feel like work never ends.” Whether you’re a yoga-pant-wearing independent contractor like me, or you telecommute or own a home-based business, Donovan says there are six reasons why you should dress up in workplace attire. 1. You Maintain A Professional Perception If you are part of a team and participate in video meetings, it’s important to dress the part, says Donovan. “Video connections help form relationships, and if you are not dressed for success, you could be sending the wrong message,” he says, adding that casual clothes can send the message that you’re not working. “It might look like you just rolled out of bed. The visual is powerful, and perception becomes reality.”

2. You Boost Your Own Productivity What we put on influences how we act. A study from Northwestern University found that certain clothing can influence the wearer’s psychological processes. “Wearing a lab coat described as a doctor’s coat increased sustained attention compared to wearing a lab coat described as a painter’s coat, and compared to simply seeing or even identifying with a lab coat described as a doctor’s coat,” wrote researchers Hajo Adam and Adam D. Galinsky. “The influence of clothes thus depends on wearing them and their symbolic meaning.” Dressing professional puts us in a different mental state, adds Donovan. “We feel more present, and we have a higher level of commitment and engagement,” he says. 3. You Comply With Company Culture If your company has a dress code, you should not feel you’re above the rules, says Donovan. “Comply with the culture of the rest of the company,” he says. “You don’t want to put your job in jeopardy.” The idea that you should dress for the job you want still pertains, Donovan adds. “If that happens to be the captain of couch surfing, then go ahead and dress for the part,” he says. “But if it’s to manage a global team, dressing for that job will be what is expected of you by others and unconsciously by yourself.” 4. You Create Boundaries While the lines between work and home are blurring, dressing in business wear during office hours can help to create a separation of your work and personal sides.

“Wearing work clothes can send a signal that you’re working and shouldn’t be disturbed.” Donovan, who is a principal of the diversity and inclusion consulting firm The Dagoba Group, wears a button-down shirt and dress pants to work from home and says it signifies that he’s his work self. “When I change into casual clothes, it’s a physical and visual distinction, and it helps me set boundaries,” he says. “Otherwise you could feel like work never ends. Your personal life could take over work time or your work commitments can take over personal time. Clothing helps create a distinct separation.” 5. You Give Others a Visual Reminder When you work from home, other people in your household or personal circle may not understand and respect your time. “If you are in jeans and a T-shirt, it wouldn’t come to mind to someone else that you’re working,” says Donovan. “Wearing work clothes can send a signal that you’re working and shouldn’t be disturbed.” 6. You Can Help Keep Your Focus It’s common to be in a situation where you’re physically present but mentally somewhere else, such as checking email while you’re in a meeting. Clothes help you to collocate, says Donovan. “Clothes can act as a reminder, dragging you mentally into work mode,” he says. “If you’re wearing dress clothes, you will be far less likely to do chores. Clothes can pull you away from tangents that try to pull you away mentally.” Testing The Theory While I love my workout/work attire, I decided to try the concept and dressed as if I were going to an office for a week. What you wear to work from home should reflect the culture of your company, advises Donovan. “If you are independent, you might want to reflect the culture of clients,” he says. I chose dress pants, a blouse, and a blazer, as well as a couple of dresses that have been collecting dust in my closet. I was very skeptical that it would make a difference, but I quickly found that I was wrong. I tend to take care of household tasks while I work, throwing in a load of laundry or taking a work break to make a bed. While it’s nice to check these tasks off of my to-do list, the practice breaks up my day and serves as an easy form of procrastination. Wearing work clothes, however, kept me in work mode. I felt more focused–even though my laundry did pile up. I changed into casual clothes at 5 p.m., and the act gave my day a distinct shift. This felt like an improvement to work-life balance because I tend to feel like I’m always working. Surprisingly, I didn’t feel the urge to respond to after-hours emails, and I even took an entire weekend off.

While I might don my yoga pants on my own personal casual Friday, I will definitely keep up this experiment. “Dress for success” just might be my new productivity mantra. Related Video: It’s Actually Pretty Easy To Work Remotely From The Caribbean"

Though it was based on a Lotus chassis, and limited to just a few thousand examples worldwide, the Roadster was one of the first mainstream electric sports cars you could actually buy, following its introduction in 2006.

With a base 248-horsepower (184-kilowatt) electric motor, a range of 244 miles (392 kilometers) on a single charge, and a 0-60 mph (96 kmh) time of about 3.9 seconds, it was one of the quickest, too. A total of four variants were introduced in its four-year production run, ranging in power from the base 248-hp model, to the 288-hp (214 kW) 2.5 Sport. Production officially came to a close in 2012, with just 2,450 examples being sold in more than 30 countries.

Five years later, and Tesla has finally introduced a successor for the much-loved Roadster – at least a concept of which. Shown alongside the new Tesla semi-truck, the company touted some ridiculous performance figures on stage, and an equally daunting six-figure price tag to go along with it. But the one question on everyone's mind remains: how does the new model compare to the original?

In its most powerful trim – the 2011 2.5 Sport – the original Tesla Roadster produced 288 hp (215 kW) and 295 pound-feet (400 Newton-meters) of torque courtesy of a 53 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. It came paired to a single-speed BorgWarner transmission, allowing for a 0-60 mph sprint of about 3.7 seconds, and returning a range of up to 244 miles.

With a price tag of around $128,500, the Roadster 2.5 Sport was never meant to be a cheap vehicle. Admittedly the 2.5 model did come with a number of unique features over the standard model, particularly a revised front fascia, directional forged wheels, new seats, an optional seven-inch touchscreen display with a back-up camera, and improved sound reduction.

Roadster 1.5 Roadster 2.0 Roadster 2.5 Roadster 2.5 Sport 2020 Roadster Horsepower 248 248 288 288 N/A Torque 200 lb-ft 280 lb-ft 280 lb-ft 295 lb-ft 7,376 lb-ft Range 244 miles 244 miles 244 miles 244 miles 620 miles 0-60 4.6 seconds 4.6 seconds 3.7 seconds 3.7 seconds 1.9 seconds Top Speed

125 mph 125 mph 125 mph 125 mph 250+ mph Price $109,000 $109,000 $112,000 $128,500 $200,000 The new Tesla Roadster, though, is something different entirely. Of course, we’re taking all of the mentioned performance details with a grain of salt considering the new Roadster won’t be on the road until at least 2020. That said, Elon Musk touts a 0-60 mph time of just 1.9 seconds – which would make it the quickest car ever built, theoretically. The electric motor is reportedly capable of producing 7,376 pound-feet of torque (!), thus allowing for the sub-two-second 0-60 time, a top speed of 250-plus miles per hour (402 kmh), all while returning an impressive 620 miles (997 kilometers) of range on the highway. Again, we remain skeptical.

Of course, for all that performance you’ll be paying a pretty hefty price. The new Tesla Roadster will start at $200,000, or $250,000 if you want the limited ""Founder’s Edition."" Just 1,000 examples of the latter will be built. Buyers will need to put down a $50,000 deposit to reserve one, with production scheduled to kick off sometime in 2020.

Let's hope the new Roadster lives up to the hype."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Pritchard/AP Justin Pritchard/AP

Friday is a big day for Tesla. The automaker's very first Model 3 will roll off the assembly line, the culmination of years of planning, engineering and hype.

Elon Musk, the company's co-founder and chief executive, has been promising an affordable long-range electric car meant for the masses. He first wrote about the dream vehicle in the company's not-so-secret Secret Plan in 2006.

And with a $35,000 price tag (and a $7,500 government rebate), the Model 3 is well within the reach of the new-car buyer. The Model 3 is expected to have a range of 215 miles per charge. Musk plans to hand over 30 vehicles to customers on July 28, ramping up to 1,500 in September.

But the real question for many is: Can Tesla and Musk pull off a mass-market success? Last month, Tesla sold about 4,400 cars total. While the company won't confirm exactly how many orders it has for the Model 3, it's thought that nearly half a million customers have signed up to be on the waiting list.

""Tesla has proven it can manufacture and market vehicles in some volume on an ongoing basis,"" says Jack Nerad with Kelley Blue Book. The automaker's recent success puts Tesla significantly ahead of most startup specialty vehicle manufacturers. ""But now the rubber is going to hit the road in the form of the Tesla Model 3,"" Nerad says. ""It's volume play.""

Tesla plans to vastly scale up production, to 500,000 cars next year — more than the annual sales of Toyota Camrys.

A key to the future of Tesla is in building batteries. The company has invested billions in its battery Gigafactory in Nevada, and on Friday announced plans to install a massive lithium ion battery in Australia to help solve a local energy shortage.

With all of this going on, can Tesla sustain its momentum? Already, Tesla's lofty stock price has taken a hit, losing nearly 20 percent of its value after Musk reported disappointing sales of current models amid battery shortages. The company says it has resolved the battery issue.

Cost and production of batteries are still impediments to widespread acceptance of electric cars. Adoption of battery technology is unlikely without continued major government subsidies, which essentially ""consigns batteries to a suboptimal solution,"" says Geoff Wardle with the Art Center College of Design.

Electric cars won't take off, he says, until batteries can hold more capacity and weigh less. That moment is ""still a bit over the horizon,"" Wardle says."

But even if Musk may be celebrating this weekend, the wait is far from over for many of those awaiting delivery of their shiny new sedan.

Nearly 400,000 Tesla customers have pre-ordered the Model 3. But most won’t get them soon. Following a “handover party” for the first 30 buyers later this month, Tesla says production for the $35,000-and-up vehicle will reach 100 vehicles per month by August, “above” 1,500 per month by September, and then a hefty 20,000 per month by December. However, given Musk’s history of missing his own ambitious deadlines, some experts question whether Tesla will actually reach those figures without hitting speed bumps along the way.

“It seems improbable, doesn’t it?” said Mark Mills, a technology forecaster and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a New York City-based think tank. “In this case, past performance is certainly indicative of the future.”

“Those targets do seem a bit steep,” added Jeremy Acevedo, a senior analyst at automotive site Edmunds. “Growing pains are going to be expected.”

Those growing pains may take the form of production issues as Tesla seeks to dramatically ramp up its output without a sacrifice in quality. Supply chain problems have long plagued Tesla, which began selling high-end niche electric sportscars in 2008 and is now on the cusp of launching what it hopes will be a mainstream electric car revolution. The Model X SUV in particular has suffered from production issues. Some observers have offered grim predictions of similar problems for the Model 3, though Friday’s rollout is slightly ahead of schedule. (It was a Twitter user’s recent plea for Musk to “have mercy” and stop the “speculation on [the] Model 3 final release date” that seemingly prompted Musk to tease an update on the new vehicle.)

News on Sunday — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2017

Just this week, Bloomberg reported that a decline in shipment deliveries due to a battery pack shortage has left industry analysts concerned about the company. They’re wondering whether Tesla will be able to hit its Model 3 production goals, particularly since it has typically taken Tesla three months to make the number of cars it hopes to build this December alone. Producing a few dozen cars is one thing — producing tens of thousands is something entirely different.

“While it is nice to see Tesla finally hit a stated target on time, we question whether 30 vehicle deliveries essentially built by hand count as ‘mass production,’” Cowen and Co. managing director and senior research analyst Jeffrey Osbourne wrote in note to clients Wednesday, Bloomberg reported. “We also are surprised that this ‘mass market’ vehicle does not have official photos, options, pricing or really any details available.”

In the face of growing deadline pressure, Mills said that Tesla might rush to meet its targets, resulting in a decline of quality. But he added that Tesla’s brand prestige and fan following put it in a unique position that could help it survive setbacks.

“It will be unsurprising if we see six months from now reports about recalls. But people buying Teslas are more tolerant of recalls then the typical automobile,” Mills said. “They like the story and Elon handles it very well.”

Mills said the real challenge for Tesla is whether it can navigate what he described as a “reverse route.” Tesla is taking an unusual path by establishing itself as a premium, expensive manufacturer first, before shifting to more affordable vehicles. “The nature of how you manufacture and sell things that cost $100,000 is radically different from manufacturing things that cost three times less. It’s a different process with different metrics and a different customer base,” Mills said.

“Chevrolet makes the Corvette, which is undeniably a nice car,” Mills added. “But their expertise in making consumer cars was already among the best of the world. I’m skeptical that Musk can integrate that market.”

Still, others see a sensible plan in Tesla’s strategy. “I think it’s a successful Model that [Musk] has laid out,”Acevedo said. “You look at what Tesla has done, these vehicles with unprecedented demand — Tesla has become an aspirational brand. Now you reduce the price tag and the entry fees and you see things like those nearly 400,000 [Model 3] preorders.”"

Investors expect Tesla to dominate the electric future of cars the way Apple gobbles up smartphone profits and Amazon dominates e-commerce.

But the future of cars is a riddle within an enigma, as the industry sits at a crossroads facing several divergent futures—driven vs. self-driving, private vs. shared, gas vs. electric. Here are three questions that will shape the future of cars.

1. Will people drive cars, or will the cars drive themselves?

The self-driving revolution is like a massive West Coast earthquake—experts claim it’s practically inevitable, but nobody can say for sure when or what it will look like. Business Insider Intelligence predicts there will be 10 million self-driving cars on the road in three years. In 10 years, about a quarter of miles driven in the United States could be in self-driving electric cars, according to Boston Consulting Group.

If this self-driving future never fully materializes, legacy car companies will probably benefit from the lack of disruption. But is it so obvious that they would also lose, even in the self-driving scenario?

To be sure, investors are betting against them. The price-earnings ratio—a company’s share price divided by its earnings per share—is a barometer of investors’ optimism in future profit growth. The average P/E for the S&P 500 is in the mid-20s. But the ratios for car companies, like Ford, GM, and Toyota, are all around 10, which suggests that investors aren’t confident that their profits will last. (Tesla has no P/E ratio, since it has no E.) Musk is preparing for the autonomous future by installing self-driving hardware in all of his new cars. This way, when Tesla finally acquires or develops the software for fully autonomous driving, cars bought this year can be retrofitted to drive themselves.

Earlier this month, Navigant Research published a report that declared the worldwide leader in self-driving tech is Ford, followed by GM, Renault-Nissan, Daimler, and Volkswagen—all car companies. Tesla finished 12th. One research report isn’t gospel. But it suggests that the “Tesla Is Apple, and Cars Are Smartphones” thesis has some serious limitations. In 2007, Apple’s competitors thought the iPhone was a terrible idea. But in 2017, almost all of Tesla’s competitors are engaged in a global race to build electric and autonomous vehicles, and some of them are arguably ahead of Musk in software and distribution capacity.

2. Is the future of cars electric, or something else?

The simplest story about Tesla goes like this: It has the best technology, by far, and strongest brand, by far, in the auto market’s largest growth sector."
https://electrek.co/2017/04/14/tesla-vehicle-programs/,pos,0.9999982664737094,1.7335262948499182e-06,Tesla has now 8 vehicle programs in the works: an updated look at its planned vehicle lineup,2017-04-14 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:37:13.951466,Tesla Amazon Shop + Get Tesla Merch + More Directly Tesla On Amazon + Tesla Referral Code + Get Miles Of Free Supercharger When Order A New Model + Model S + Or Model X,"Tesla’s automotive business is expanding quickly and we are not only talking about the Model 3. The Model 3 program will significantly increase its overall production capacity from roughly 2,000 vehicles per week to ~7,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year if all goes well, but Tesla is also expanding its automotive offering with now 8 vehicle programs at different stages of development.

CEO Elon Musk’s update yesterday gives us a better idea – albeit still vague – of the timeline for those programs.

Here are the 8 vehicle programs:

Most people know about the Model S and X, which are both currently in production and are expected to keep their positions as Tesla’s flagship luxury sedan and SUV for the foreseeable future.

Of course, the Model 3 is also well-known and while it’s not in production yet, it should be in the next few months as long as there are no delays.

After the Model 3, the timeline to production for Tesla’s other vehicle programs becomes less clear.

Musk said in the past that the Model Y, a small SUV based on the same platform as the Model 3, will be Tesla’s priority once the company gets a handle on the Model 3 production ramp up.

But we have yet to hear anything about a planned reveal of a Model Y prototype and instead, Musk confirmed yesterday a planned unveiling of Tesla Semi, the company’s upcoming all-electric semi truck, for September.

Does it mean that Tesla Semi is further along the development process than the Model Y or Tesla is only keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to the compact SUV? It’s hard to say at this point.

Musk also made rare and welcomed references to the next generation Roadster recently after the upcoming vehicle was surprisingly left out of Musk’s product plan last year. He confirmed that the vehicle is still planned, but “a few years away” and yesterday he added that it will be a convertible.

Furthermore, Musk clarified that the “Tesla Pickup truck” is only going to be revealed “18 to 24 months” from now. Considering the current popularity of pickup trucks, we would have thought that it would have been further up Tesla’s list of priorities, but apparently, we are not likely to see it before 2019, which means that production before 2020 is unlikely.

The last vehicle is what we have been referring to as the “Tesla Minibus”, a microbus built on the Model X chassis. Musk said that the bus is inspired by the “California Custom VW combi design art”. Jalopnik came up with the rendering seen below to help visualize what it could look like:

Since Tesla plans to build the vehicle on the Model X chassis, it could be further along the development process than most other vehicles, but it doesn’t have a clear unveiling timeline like Tesla Semi.

Based on the information we have so far, here are my best guesstimates (emphasize that these are guesses) for the production timelines for each upcoming model:

Tesla Model Y – late 2018

Tesla Roadster next-gen – 2019

Tesla Minibus – 2019

Tesla Pickup truck – 2020

Tesla Semi – low-volume late 2018

Remember 2012, when electric cars were commonly derided as highway-legal golf carts? When electric cars were reserved for the eco-obsessed loonies? Nobody who wears a tie to work would have been caught dead in one. Then Tesla's Model S came a' knockin'. People may forget this history, but the truth is the Model S was the first car that showed us that our battery-powered future could still be cool. 5 years later, the landscape of the market is unrecognizable. Electric is the rage, crossovers are the craze and minimalism is the prime directive. One thing remains, though: the Model S is, without a doubt, the coolest car you can buy.

Exterior: I'll take 16 feet of car please

Pulled over for a shot of the Tesla Model S P100D Mack Hogan | CNBC

Part of the brilliance of the original Model S was that you didn't have to drive around in a rolling billboard for ""ZERO EMISSIONS"" just to save some money on gas. The Tesla, sleek and modern though it may be, is in total just a regular-looking car. Of course, after five years there have been some changes. Namely, the faux grill has disappeared, further cleaning up the lines. In fact, the absence of a grille and tailpipes are your only real clues to this car's environmental mission. Ignoring the ""Z E R O EMISSIONS"" front plate, which I'd take off as soon as I had the keys, it's a pretty generic sedan. That's not a bad thing, as the car is well proportioned and conventionally handsome. The Model S P100D got a lot of attention everywhere I took it. Of course, I live in Columbus, OH, not the Bay Area. Your mileage may vary. Rest assured, pulling up anywhere in a Tesla will at the very least get you approving nods. So call the exterior a win, if only for your own reputation.

Interior: Even the mighty shall fall

Sitting in the front seat of the Model S P100D Mack Hogan | CNBC

Tesla's interior game is weaker than nearly every rival. The design is almost entirely based around a center 17-inch tablet, not so much integrated as stuck into the dash. It's quick to respond, intuitive and well designed. Software menus are simple to navigate, and nothing is more than a few clicks away. Essential functions like climate control are put on the bottom of the screen, deeply below the beltline of the vehicle. This means you have to take your eyes off the road to adjust the temperature. Unlike knobs, which you can memorize and use by feel, the car requires your visual attention. Good thing it has Autopilot, I suppose. Now, Tesla defenders will likely point out that most essential functions can be performed through steering wheel buttons. They're right, but you have to click on the scroll wheel, scroll to what you'd like to adjust, and scroll to adjust it. Turning off the air conditioning or opening the sunroof just became a three step process.

The Model S P100D at a charging station Mack Hogan | CNBC

I understand that this is all done through software to cut costs and make it easier for Tesla to upgrade the car after you buy it, but it still feels like a step back. So, too, do the seats. In a day where I spent 8 hours driving to and from Detroit, including Supercharging stops, I emerged from the Model S with my butt feeling like stone and my legs like Jello. I've done that trip quite a few times in a variety of cars, and I've never felt that broken afterward. Add in synthetic leather that doesn't feel particularly soft or high-quality, cheap faux-carbon fiber trim, and a decent amount of questionable plastics and the $157,700 price tag becomes questionable.

Driving Experience: Where it all makes sense

The Model S gets noticed Mack Hogan | CNBC

The Model S wasn't quite the most comfortable place to spend 8 hours round trip to and from Detroit. But my goodness does the driving experience make up for it. Brutal. Painful. Mind-boggling. Perception-warping. Straight-up stupid. That's how it feels to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.4 seconds. The Model S P100D with Ludicrous Speed Upgrade is the only production car ever made that can give you that experience. No Buggati, no Ferrari can match that off-the-line savagery. That's not to say the Tesla is a supercar. I see that word thrown around a lot, and it's not accurate. Drive longer than a quarter mile and the red-blooded supercars of the world will beat the Model S as the speeds pick up. Toss in corners and it'll look like the Tesla's standing still. The Tesla is simply too big and heavy to be any fun to chuck around, but that's not what it's for. It's a dragstrip fiend with heated seats, the muscle car of the 21st century.

You can enjoy that acceleration and brutality, but then settle in for a long comfortable cruise. Standard air suspension quiets the ride on the freeways, and the lack of combustion means the wind is the only thing making even a hint of noise at 70 miles per hour. Equally as eerie as the silence is the guiding hand of Autopilot, Tesla's innovative suite of advanced driver assistance technology. On a divided, well-marked highway the vehicle is capable of fully controlling its own throttle, brakes and steering to maintain your set course. Flick the indicator stalk, and your robotic butler will even make the lane changes for you. It's not perfect, frequently appearing too confident in its own limited abilities, but it adds to the other-worldly driving experience of the Model S.

Value: Hard Bargain

At $157,700, this car doesn't come easy. For that price, true supercars like the Acura NSX come into focus. On the flip side, the Tesla also has to contend with super-sedans from Mercedes and BMW. The value proposition against the true supercars is good, as the Tesla comes with five seats and two trunks. Against a BMW 7 series or Mercedes S-Class, though, it's a harder argument. A Mercedes S550 can be had for cheaper, has an interior leagues above the Tesla, is bigger, offers more comfort features like massaging seats and can drive across the country with only 5-minute fuel stops. The Tesla devastates the Germans on straight-line performance and wrecks them in terms of cool factor, so it comes down to what's important.

Final Thoughts

If you want a big sedan to get you to work, a German luxury barge is probably better for you in almost every way. The money you save on gas doesn't come near to offsetting the price premium of the Tesla for similar equipment. But if you go that route, you're driving something with an expiration date. The big, V8 sedans are on their way out. The Tesla Model S is the future, with its minimalism and it's upgradability and touch screen. It's the new age of luxury, and it feels different for it.

No gasoline here Mack Hogan | CNBC

Something about driving a gas car after the Tesla felt old. In the Tesla you don't start the car, you get in and put it in gear. It's ready when you are. Pushing a button or — gasp — turning a key feels barbarian. Waiting for a transmission to shift so you can pass feels idiotic, the Tesla has power always. Not being able to set the climate control from an app seems tremendously archaic, and driver assistance systems that aren't Autopilot seem a bit dimwitted. And that's the power of the Model S. Every logical fact should point you far away from it. Dozens of little things about it probably will annoy you. But there's something about it that makes you despise the old way. It's the reason that everyone who buys one says they'll never buy anything else. From the moment you sit in it, you know you're driving the beginning of something better. It's not perfect, it may not even make sense. But if nothing else, the Tesla Model S is the start of something new and exciting. I can't help but love it for that. Ratings Exterior: 5

Tesla has had a meteoric rise as an underdog company, but the next five years could be its biggest challenge yet.

Major automakers from across the globe are preparing massive electric-car rollouts, perhaps none as large as Daimler, Mercedes' parent company. The German automaker plans to electrify its fleet of cars by 2020 and is investing $11 billion to make it happen.

In many ways, taking down Tesla is no easy feat. The company has secured brand loyalty on par with Apple, which can be attributed to the admiration surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's stated commitment to building a sustainable future. It has pushed the industry in ways that have never been seen before, from implementing over-the-air updates to challenging the traditional dealership model.

Yet Tesla has some weaknesses, mostly its struggle to execute on production. The Model S and Model X both suffered delays and the company has yet to overcome its manufacturing hurdles — Tesla produced 260 Model 3s in the third-quarter out of a targeted 1,500 sedans due to ""production bottlenecks.""

Daimler has a shot of taking down Tesla, but it won't be easy.

Daimler has to rebrand itself to compete with Tesla

Mercedes isn't really known as an electric-car brand, but it hopes to change that. Mercedes-Benz

Daimler hasn't been shy about its intention to take on Tesla.

The Germany automaker announced in September that it would invest $1 billion in its Alabama plant to build an electric SUV, which is slated to hit the market in 2020. Many media outlets were quick to point out this was a direct affront to Tesla, though Musk didn't see it that way:

Daimler took an apparent shot back at Tesla when it said it had already announced an additional $10-billion investment in next-generation electric vehicles:

Musk's tweet didn't prompt Daimler's $10 billion investment, as the company had announced the electric-car funding in 2016.

It would also be reductive to argue that Tesla's prowess in the EV space was the single defining characteristic that pushed Daimler to embrace electric cars. China's announcement that it will ban diesel- and gas-powered cars going forward is a major influencing factor, considering the country is the largest auto market in the world.

Likely, Daimler's recent competitive streak with Tesla on Twitter is more of an acknowledgment that to win the electric-vehicle race requires convincing consumers that Mercedes cars can compete with the products of Elon Musk. If electric cars are the inevitable future, Daimler can't ignore Tesla's position in the market.

Like all German car companies, Daimler's identity is connected to the diesel engine — Mercedes cars are seen as the classic speed machines of the Autobahn rather than high-tech models of a driverless future. It will take some work for Mercedes to rebrand itself as a Tesla competitor.

""It's not in their DNA and their history because they are much more of a performance brand,"" Gary Silberg, the Americas head of automotive at KPMG, said in an interview. ""The electric architecture of the vehicle is different than their great prowess with diesel and ICE engines, so that's certainly a change.""

Daimler will look to beat Tesla in China

The fiercest competition will happen in China — not only because it's the largest car market in the world, but because there's still time to carve out a sizeable portion of the market.

Tesla is working fast to lay the groundwork for a push in China. It plans to build a factory in Shanghai that will start producing cars in 2020. It also secured backing from Tencent, which Musk said will allow the Chinese firm to become a passive advisor.

Daimler already has set-up a joint venture with Chinese automaker BAIC. The two announced in July they were investing $750 million in Chinese electric-vehicle production so Mercedes can secure a ""substantial share"" of the market by 2025.

Wilko Stark, Mercedes' vice president of strategy, said in an interview that China will ultimately be the company's most important market.

""China is our biggest market and will stay so in the future by far,"" Stark said. ""As an incumbent, we have a big advantage because we know the Chinese market very well.""

Daimler will also aim to replicate the 'Tesla ecosystem'

Mercedes' home battery can now be bought in California. Mercedes-Benz Daimler has also started laying the foundation to take on Tesla by mimicking Musk's vision for a solar-based ecosystem.

Musk has said that the ideal home would have solar panels on the roof, a Tesla in the garage, and a home battery to tie everything together.

Tesla launched an energy division in 2015 to start selling its residential battery, the Powerwall. The automaker bought SolarCity in a deal worth $2.1 billion last November to vertically integrate all of the different pieces.

Mercedes took a shot at Tesla in March when it launched its home battery on Tesla's home turf of California, which is also sold in Germany and the United Kingdom. The US launch was due to a new partnership with solar-panel installer Vivint.

Boris von Bormann, CEO of Mercedes' energy division, said the Vivint partnership was meant to support Daimler's electric vehicle push in the US in 2019.

""We're looking really to build the total ecosystem around the vehicle,"" Bormann told Business Insider. ""We're looking at how we prepare the infrastructure so that the transition from a combustion engine to an electric engine happens as smoothly as possible.""

Daimler is investing $1 billion in its Alabama plant to build the Mercedes EQ, an electric SUV that will hit the market in 2020. Stark said Daimler deliberately chose to release an SUV because demand for the larger vehicles have been high the last several years.

The EQ will hit the market at the same time as Tesla's Model Y SUV, meaning Tesla will have direct competition for the first time. Tesla did have some competition this year when its Model 3 hit the market at the same time as the Chevy Bolt, but it's difficult to compare completely different vehicle types with varying price tags.

""The US will be a key footprint for our battery-electric vehicle strategy,"" Wilko Andreas Stark, Mercedes' VP of strategy, said in an interview. ""We are pretty confident we will convince the customer that [the EQ] will be the best offer on the market.""

There's no clear winner in the heated EV race — but Tesla will need to prepare for competition

AP Photo/Jack Plunkett Daimler's sheer size doesn't necessarily mean it has the company beat; many people buy a Tesla because they want a Tesla, not an electric car. Tesla is also a popular choice among lucrative Chinese buyers.

But it's clear that Tesla has thrived in a market with very few viable contenders — 2020 will be the first test as to whether Tesla can survive when a giant like Daimler tries to eat its lunch.

""Tesla did a great job as a frontrunner, but all of the others will come now,"" Stark said. ""We believe our vehicles coming up are more attractive to Tesla in the long term.""

KPMG's Silberg said Tesla has an advantage when it comes to its story and general branding. Tesla hasn't had to pay a dime for marketing and still secured 455,000 reservations for the Model 3. People are fascinated with the company's storyline that Musk has developed by challenging automotive norms, from releasing Autopilot to developing a super-fast charging infrastructure.

Daimler will need to convince consumers it can compete as a bespoke brand without the classic diesel engine. But it's reputation as a reliable manufacturer shouldn't be overlooked. As Tesla continues to struggle to execute on production for the Model 3, buyers may be inclined to go with the more reliable Mercedes SUV down the road.

""I don't think anyone would argue that Mercedes' doesn't have world-class manufacturing prowess and Tesla is learning,"" Silberg said. ""They have great manufacturing prowess and they've been in China longer and have a partner — and that's absolutely an advantage."""

Today the company announced a suite of upgrades to the system, to be pushed over-the-air to existing cars over the next couple of weeks.

“This is quite a massive enhancement,” said Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, at a press confernce. “I wish we could have done it earlier.”

Chief among the improvements in Autopilot Version 8.0 is increased reliance on the radar system in the company’s Model S and Model X. The sensors have been in Teslas since October 2014, and the new software will download and run on existing hardware—although Musk says it was quite a job to get it to fit.

Autopilot builds a picture of the world around it using a forward-looking camera mounted near the rear view mirror, a radar in the front bumper, and 12 ultrasonic sensors around the vehicle. Until now, the car’s computer has used the image from the camera as the primary information source.

Tesla says that the new software shifts that burden to the radar, unlocking six times as many information points per object with every reflected pulse. Ten times a second the radar will ping outward, and then assemble those reflections into a 3D image as the car moves.

Radar is a bit of a blunt tool when it comes to imaging, but Tesla has improved the signal processing to make it work, the company says. The repetition is helpful too; it’ll increase the car’s confidence that a reflected pulse is a real object. Obviously not seeing an actual object would be a big deal—the car might hit it. But false positives are almost as bad. An autonomous car is useless if it continually slams on the brakes for no reason.

Maybe even more importantly, the cars don’t learn in isolation. “We’re adding 1.5 million miles per day on Autopilot,” says Musk. And the whole fleet learns at once. Even when the system isn’t on, it’s gathering data. The radar could be triggered by a sign over the road, and think there’s something in the path. The radar image still gets geotagged, but if the driver doesn’t manually brake, and neither do several other Teslas at the same place, every Tesla everywhere will learn that it is not something to worry about.

Musk says these improvements would likely have been enough to avoid a fatal crash in Florida in May 2016, where a Model S with Autopilot on hit a tractor trailer crossing the road in its path. The camera on the car didn’t see the white truck against the bright sky, and neither did the driver. Radar would have. It will sense anything dense, and particularly metallic.

Musk points out that radar also works well in low visibility situations like fog. It can sense a multi-car pile-up tangle of metal ahead, long before the camera or the driver can.

Recent criticism has lead to other new features. If drivers ignore warnings to keep their hands on the wheel more than three times an hour, they’ll have to pull over and put the car in park to re-engage the auto steering system. Musk says Tesla has data showing drivers ignore up to 10 beeps an hour at the moment. “We really want to avoid that situation,” he says.

Musk admits that it's impossible to avoid every accident. “You have these rare events occasionally—they’re tragic—but to eliminate all of them we’d be limited to sitting at home on a pillow.”

Tesla has run these changes past the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—Musk says the feds seem happy. “I think we’re making the Model S and X by far the safest cars on the road. I don’t think there’s even a model within a multiple,” he says.

Tesla will be hoping that these improvements keep it in the lead when it comes to autonomous technology, but other automakers are trying to catch up. For a full demonstration of how Autopilot works in practice, see our video:"

Not bad, but this is just the beginning. CEO Elon Musk has long promised to change the world, with an affordable electric car for the masses, one that happens to drive itself—and to make a profit doing it. That's the key to transforming Tesla from a niche player into the company Musk says it can be, one making a palpable, positive impact on people's lives and the planet they share, while keeping shareholders happy.

And 2017 is the year Tesla has to pull it off, or lose its dominant position and risk being left behind as one more daring automotive startup that just could't hang.

Because behind those headline goals are the challenges in turning vaporware into a physical product at scale, that stage at which so many companies fail. And Tesla has to make that transformation while fighting off increasing competition from mainstream and newer automakers, continuing to improve its autonomous technology, and avoiding negative press.

Yes, Musk—who also builds rockets, sells solar roofs, and advises Donald Trump on tech issues—seems to thrive on pressure. And hey, he has made it this far. But he also has a bad habit of letting deadlines slip and costs creep north. And that may not fly anymore.

A Model For The Masses

Musk’s plan for Tesla has long been to start by selling luxury cars (the Model S sedan and Model X SUV), then use the resulting revenue to fund the development of a car everyone can afford—the long-awaited Model 3. At a starting price of $35,000, it’s in mainstream territory. Selling millions of them is fundamental to Musk's goal: popularizing sustainable transport and slowing climate change.

For Tesla, the problem isn't creating a car that appeals to millions—the automaker took 400,000 pre-orders for the Model 3 within weeks after revealing a prototype. The problem is producing millions of cars, on time, up to quality standards, without losing money.

“Delivering a brand new electric vehicle built from scratch is not an easy task to accomplish,"" says Raj Rajkumar, an expert in autonomous and electric vehicles at Carnegie Mellon University. Tesla has pledged it will start deliveries in late 2017, but Rajkumar says 2018 is more realistic. ""They need to learn about volume production, and test new capabilities and functions.”

For context, Tesla threw everything at increasing production in 2016, doubling annual production to about 100,000 cars. In April, Musk said he wants to produce half a million cars a year by 2020. Then in May, he said he'd get there by 2018. It's an aggressive promise, given the degree of difficulty here. Increasing production tenfold in the space of three years demands exquisite control of global supply chains. A delay in a single component, from a single supplier, could hobble production and profit targets.

Musk says he learned valuable lessons from the ""production hell"" of the Model X, the overly complicated SUV that reached market two years late. He says the design of the Model 3 is far simpler (no crazy falcon doors, for example), in a bid to smooth the road to production. But that road still involves scaling up and streamlining work at its Fremont plant, and avoiding any quality issues that tend to come with quantity increases. It also has to keep pace by building out its proprietary service centers and already overcrowded supercharging network for all those new cars.

Tesla lost the race to build the affordable, long-range EV to General Motors, but the Model 3 and the Chevy Bolt serve different purposes. The Bolt is a halo car for GM, a sign of its ability to innovate—and a tiny fraction of its total output. “GM is a large company with global scale supply chain, and established manufacturing plants, but even then the Bolt will be sold at a loss,” says Rajkumar. Even then, it might be a victory. Tesla needs the Model 3 to be a financial success, because the small sedan will be its bread and butter car, making up the large majority of its sales.

Maintaining a Lead in Self Driving

Electric cars aren't quite enough for Musk's outsized ambitions. In October, the CEO announced plans to make every Tesla capable of driving itself—not just on the highway, but everywhere, in all conditions.

So Tesla is already equipping all vehicles coming out of its factory with the hardware Musk believes they need to make that happen, and he has promised to send a car from Los Angeles to New York by the end of 2017. “That’s definitely doable,” says Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and an autonomous vehicle engineer at USC. He says other companies have shown similar abilities, already, like Delphi, back in 2015. The big difference is, Delphi's cross-country demo stuck to the highway, an easy task compared to what Musk has in mind: door-to-door in full autonomy, including dropping the passengers in Times Square, then parking itself.

Even if Tesla pulls it off, the voyage will be more a publicity stunt than a true demonstration of ability, says Rajkumar. Don't expect the Tesla you take home to offer the same abilities right away. Still, showing off has its uses. “Because the automated vehicle market is going to be very large in the future, Tesla needs to continue to be seen as a market leader.”

That means avoiding bad publicity as much as seeking good. “Right now Tesla has the luxury of a highly educated consumer base,” says Tim Dawkins of SBD Automotive. “They’re early adopters and tech savvy enough to be willing to participate in betas.” When Tesla starts building mass market cars, and going after typical Honda or BMW buyers, that will change. Those drivers will need to understand the limitation of their cars' technology, to avoid accidents.

To date, Tesla has been gung-ho with releasing ""beta"" versions of its technology, and using owners as testers. “I don’t see Tesla's attitude towards risks taking a backseat,” says Rajkumar. “I think the consumers are the ones who have to be cautious.”

Competition is Growing

Once Tesla satisfies its Model 3 pre-orders, it gets another problem: finding new buyers in an increasingly crowded space. Musk has built a serious fanbase, but as he seeks to expand past the eager early adopters, he'll have to fend off old and new competitors. At the low end, there's Chevy, which started delivering the Bolt this month.

At the high end, which Tesla has dominated for years with its Model S and Model X, companies like Faraday Future, Lucid Motors, and Fisker are all building fast, sexy, electric cars in the six-figure range. The conventional automakers are getting in on the act too. Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, VW, and Jaguar—to name a few—are building compelling electric SUVs which promise to pull buyers from the Model X.

Despite the fan fever for the Model 3, selling any electric car to the general car buying public may be difficult. Carnegie Mellon researchers have found the masses haven't yet dropped their idea of EVs as dinky golf carts. “US consumers viewed electric vehicles as $10,000 to $20,000 dollars lower in value than gasoline,” says Jeremy Michalek, director of the university's vehicle electrification group, one of the study's authors. (In China, another important market for electrics, consumers tend to view electrics as having added value.)

Early adopters might put up with the reduced range and long recharging times. Busy parents or business commuters, less likely—particularly while gas is so cheap. “If gas prices were to shoot up, that could persuade people to shift,” Michalek says. That's unlikely, and betting on the price of oil is not the soundest business strategy.

Meanwhile, another source of Tesla's income is under threat. Musk Motors makes a bundle in the US by selling the excess credits it earns for making zero-emission vehicles, to automakers with more gas-dependent offerings. Problem is, the incoming Trump administration may well be open to relaxing EPA fuel efficiency standards, so those credits could be worth less—or worthless.

The challenges are daunting, and would keep a lesser CEO than Elon Musk up at night. He'll likely just pull his sleeping bag back out and nap near the Model 3 production line until everything meets his standards. It’s worth remembering that Tesla is but a teenager in the auto game, and has already achieved remarkable success, built an enviable brand, and created jobs in America. Things that 100 year-old Detroit based auto companies are still working on perfecting.

Yes, 2017 is going to be critical, but to judge Tesla by its past performance, it’s has a strong chance of being a 'make' rather than a 'break' year."
https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593582/tesla-model-3-production-q3-largest-quarterly-loss,pos,0.9999999999914894,8.497215048544945e-12,Tesla misses first major Model 3 goal in worst financial quarter ever,2017-11-01 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:37:32.863679,Nov,"Tesla will no longer reach its long-stated goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week in 2017, pushing that deadline back amid production hiccups and a massive $619 million quarterly loss.

The automaker said Wednesday in its third quarter earnings report that Model 3 production has been slowed by progress at its Gigafactory, now saying it will reach its goal of producing 5,000 of the vehicles per week by early 2018, rather than the end of 2017.

“While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear,” the company said.

Tesla’s production problems were first revealed in October, when the company announced that it had only made 260 Model 3s since the car’s launch this summer. Tesla initially predicted that it would produce 1,500 Model 3s in September. On Twitter, CEO Elon Musk blamed “production hell” and “bottlenecks” for lower yield, but other reports pinned the blame on a production process that was still relying on hand-made parts and inadequate communication with the company’s suppliers.

On Wednesday’s call with investors, Tesla officials said the goal of producing 10,000 Model 3s per week has basically been abandoned, with the company determining how much it can ramp up production once it gets to 5,000 per week. The Fremont, California plant, when called NUMMI and owned by General Motors and Toyota, averaged less than 8,300 vehicles per week at its peak.

But none of these are new issues for Tesla. The company regularly blows its own deadlines, and it experienced a similar bout of employee dissatisfaction and on-the-job injuries in 2016 as a direct result of Tesla trying to meet ambitious production targets it set for the Model X. Last month, Model X deliveries were reported to be up 36 percent, while Model S was down 11 percent.

None of the production problems have helped Tesla’s earnings. Despite a record level of revenue for the quarter, Tesla reported a $671 million loss this quarter, its largest ever, and compared to a $336 million loss in the previous quarter. The company reported a $21 million profit in the third quarter of 2016 and an $888 million loss for all of 2016. Its total liabilities are now up to $22 billion following the investment the company has made in both the Model 3’s Fremont assembly line and the Nevada Gigafactory.

Tesla also has been facing unrest among its Fremont workers after a brutal round of firings, as well as several hundred layoffs at its SolarCity subsidiary. The United Auto Workers, which has been trying to organize Tesla’s factory employees, recently filed a complaint against the company on behalf of the fired workers. Tesla says 2 percent of its workforce had their employment terminated because of performance-related reasons, amounting to about 700 people. Musk called out some reports of Tesla’s labor issues as “shameful,” on the investors’ call.

There have also been a number of lawsuits brought by former employees alleging a toxic workplace rife with harassment and discrimination. Tesla has denied the charge.

Tesla's stock has surged 51 percent this year, sometimes surpassing that of American automakers Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and General Motors. The stock fell 3 percent on Wednesday ahead of the earnings release.

The company confirmed it would show the Tesla Semi truck at a Nov. 16 event.

“At every company in the world, there’s annual performance reviews,” Musk said, adding that Tesla has an extremely high standard, and one that’s far higher than other car companies. “You can’t be a little guy and have equal levels of skill as a big guy.”

Tesla employs 33,000 people. A 700-person cut—the number Musk cited Wednesday during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call—would mean Tesla dismissed about 2% of its workers.

The San Jose Mercury News reported in October that an estimated 400 to 700 Tesla employees were dismissed, many of whom said the dismissals came with little or no warning.

Tesla told Fortune that these cuts were made following the company’s annual performance review process. The United Auto Workers filed a complaint against Tesla on Oct. 25, claiming the company fired workers who were trying to unionize.

“You have two boxes of equal ability, and one’s much smaller, the big guy’s going to crush the little guy, obviously,” Musk elaborated. “So the little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill or he’s going to get clobbered. So that is why our standards are high. They’re not high because we believe in being mean to people. They’re high because if they’re not high, we will die.”

Musk emphasized that in spite of these high standards only 2% of people “didn’t make the grade,” noting that this is a “very low percentage.” Musk also said reports didn’t include that “several thousand employees were promoted and almost half those promotions were in manufacturing.”

In a previous statement sent to Fortune, Tesla said 17% of its employees were promoted, and almost half of those promotions were within its factory in Fremont.

A quick look at Tesla’s career page shows a different, yet related problem: lots of job openings. It’s an issue the Musk later addressed in the earnings call, noting that the company is “sucking the labor pool dry” to fill positions at its factory in Fremont, Calif., and battery factory near Reno, Nevada.

Tesla reported Wednesday that it lost $619 million in the third quarter, its biggest-ever quarterly loss. Those losses were bigger than usual as Tesla tried to speed up production of its more affordable Model 3 sedan.

The company said it had $3.53 billion in cash and cash-equivalents as of Sept. 30, compared to $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Last month, Tesla reported that it produced 260 of its new Model 3 electric cars in the third quarter, of which it has delivered 220, dramatically missing Musk’s prediction that it would produce more than 1,600 cars by September.

Overall, the company delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter. Of those, 14,065 were Model S sedans, 11,865 were Model X SUVs, and 220 were Model 3 cars."

Complications with Tesla's manufacturing processes have slowed production of the Model 3, a car widely considered key to Tesla's future success. Hopes for the Model 3 have helped propel Tesla's stock so far this year.

But in a letter to shareholders, Tesla warned it expects to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week late in the first quarter of 2018. Previously, the company had said it hoped to achieve that number by the end of this year.

Tesla shares were down 5 percent in extended hours trading.

Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:

Loss per share of $2.92 vs. $2.29 expected according to Thomson Reuters

Revenue of $2.98 billion vs. $2.95 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters

During the third quarter, Tesla said it had record net orders and deliveries of its Model S and Model X. The company confirmed it delivered 25,915 Model S and Model X vehicles and 222 Model 3 vehicles during the quarter, for a total of 26,137 deliveries.

Tesla said its production rate of the Model 3 is steadily increasing, but the high degree of automation on the Model 3 production line has proven challenging, said Tesla in the shareholder letter.

""We continue to make progress resolving early bottlenecks related to these issues, and there remain no fundamental problems with our supply chain or any of our production processes,"" Tesla said in the letter.

In particular, the battery manufacturing process at Tesla's Gigafactory 1 held Model 3 production back, Tesla said. Tesla had to take over part of the manufacturing process from suppliers and redesign the process, the company said. Tesla expects throughput to increase substantially in the near future.

The delay in Model 3 production is not likely to dampen demand for the vehicle, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.

""Model 3 reservation holders may not be thrilled about the fact that they have to wait longer than they thought for their vehicle, but it likely won't cause them to cancel their orders en masse,"" Caldwell said. ""Many Model 3 customers put deposits down on the vehicle more than a year ago before they even saw the vehicle, so it's clear Tesla buyers don't follow the usual logic-driven car buying process."""

Panasonic, the world’s largest automotive lithium-ion battery manufacturer, makes battery cells to which Tesla adds electronics to make battery packs for its cars.

Tesla earlier this month blamed manufacturing bottlenecks for limiting quarterly production of its mass-market Model 3 sedan to 260 vehicles rather than its 1,500 goal.

Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said at an earnings briefing that delays to the automation of the battery pack production line meant some stages had to be completed manually.

“This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply,” Tsuga said. He declined to comment to what extent Model 3 production would be behind its targeted schedule.

The comments came as Panasonic on Tuesday said automotive demand helped July-September operating profit rise 6 percent, beating analyst estimates. It maintained its 335 billion yen ($2.96 billion) forecast for the year ending March.

Analysts have said Panasonic’s massive Gigafactory bet makes the firm highly sensitive to Tesla’s strategy. On Tuesday, Tsuga acknowledged the bottlenecks could impact earnings, but said the contract with Tesla was designed to hedge various risks. He also said battery businesses with other clients are profitable.

Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to nearly double automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022. To that end, it has been aggressively expanding battery production capacity globally.

It plans to start production this financial year ending March at a new plant in Dalian, China, and is adding production lines in Japan - steps that could allow it to reduce dependence on Tesla.

Noboru Sato, a former battery engineer at Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) and former vice president of South Korean rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI Co Ltd (006400.KS), said Panasonic “decided to build the plant in China on requests from Honda and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).”

Toyota and Honda, already customers of Panasonic batteries, were seeking ways of procuring batteries in China, Sato said, as the government in the world’s largest automobile market promotes electric vehicles as a means of combating pollution.

“Panasonic’s decision to produce batteries in China has solved their problems,” Sato said.

Panasonic, Honda and Toyota declined to comment."

His Work Has Appeared In Wall Street Journal + Entrepreneur + Cnnmoney.Com + Cnbc.Com. You Can Read More About His Work At Www.Craigdguillot.Com.,"As Tesla strives to ramp up production to meet 400,000 orders for its new Model 3, the company has already acknowledged big production problems. In the manufacturing sector, all big moves come with big risks, and all eyes are on how Telsa will perform in the next year with it’s unorthodox fix-it-as-you-go production strategy.

The company is currently working on its Model 3 all-electric compact sedan. At the vehicle’s launch in July, CEO Elon Musk stated a production rate goal of 20,000 vehicles per month by this time. Yet as of mid-September, the company had only produced 260 vehicles, something it blamed on “bottlenecks” and what Musk said in a tweet was “production hell.”

While Tesla already has 400,000 pre-orders for the vehicle, analysts question if the company can do it, noting that the Model S and Model X production still doesn’t exceed 100,000 units per year combined. Uday Karmarkar, operations and technology specialist at UCLA Anderson School of Management said that automobile manufacturing can be very challenging and it’s “amazing Tesla has been able to build cars at all.”

Yet Tesla isn’t a traditional auto manufacturer. It took the Model S from design to full production faster than any traditional auto manufacturer would have. Musk’s fix-as-you-go strategy aimed to push vehicles through production then use the company’s innovative over-the-air technology to make software updates and fixes for things like self-drive features and battery management.

“if there’s a cascade of small problems, and maybe a few big ones, the design of the production system could fail catastrophically.”

The trade-off was that the vehicle came off the line with numerous quality issues and mechanical malfunctions. Mike Ramsey, auto industry analyst at Gartner said, “they’re still trying to work out the bugs in that vehicle.”

Despite those quality issues, there has been strong interest from consumers in the Model 3. Most traditional manufacturers go through a period of prototyping and beta testing before moving to full production. Tesla’s strategy on its Model 3 is to skip the entire process, build the full production line and produce market-ready vehicles from the start. Car executive Bob Lutz, who worked for Ford and BMW in his career, said that selling cars while the production is in such a state presents “an increased risk of having problems with the vehicles. You’re putting quality at risk for the sake of a PR event.”

Even if the company meets its volume goals, there may still be questions about quality. While Silicon Valley’s strategy of fixing as you go can work well for electronic devices, it’s not a viable model for large products like vehicles. Fixing a bug on an iPhone with a quick update is different than fixing a bug on a vehicle whose door won’t open, especially when consumers are paying a premium. While the Model 3 has a more simple design than the S and X, the sheer volume is a big challenge for the company. “As a result, if there’s a cascade of small problems, and maybe a few big ones, the design of the production system could fail catastrophically,” said Business Insider transportation correspondent Matthew DeBord.

Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted that the company could face significant “brand damage” should the Model 3 hit the market with issues. He surveyed 300 Tesla owners and found that many say the company’s service is weak and that 30% were not able to get a service appointment within 10 days of requesting one. Tesla hopes to overcome that issue by opening 100 new service centers this year along with company-owned body shops.

On the other hand, should Tesla overcome those issues, improve quality and deliver over the next year, it could solidify its places as a leader already years ahead of other electric vehicle competitors. The Model 3 starts at only $35,000 before incentives.

Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst for Cowen & Co., said there’s rising interest in the category of electric vehicles and Tesla is at the forefront. “We see the competitive tides shifting in 2019 and beyond as European [car makers] roiled by the diesel scandal and loss of share to Tesla in the high margin luxury segment step on the gas and accelerate the pace of EV introductions,” Osborne said."

Electric carmaker Tesla pushed back targets for its new Model 3 car, admitting it's months behind schedule.

Tesla said it would now produce 5,000 of the cars each week by early 2018, instead of December.

The new target emerged as Tesla posted its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending its shares down more than 5% in after-hours trading.

Tesla made net losses of $619m (£468m) in the three months to 30 September, nearly double the previous quarter.

A year earlier, the firm made a profit of $21.9m. The losses were bigger than usual because Tesla has been focused on ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.

Image copyright Tesla Image caption Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018

The carmaker is hoping to attract mass market interest in the vehicle which is priced at $35,000, about half the cost of its Model S car.

Tesla said it had produced just 260 of the Model 3 cars in the third quarter, less than a fifth of the 1,500 vehicles it had planned to build.

In a statement the company said it continued ""to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks"".

""The nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear"", it said.

Gigafactory delays

Tesla said the main constraint was that progress had slowed at its Gigafactory in Nevada where its battery modules are assembled, and part of the production process has needed to be redesigned.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla boss Elon Musk said he was ""really depressed"" about the slow progress

""I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,"" chief executive Elon Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what changes need to be made.

But there could be further problems ahead.

While quarterly revenues rose about 30% from a year ago to nearly $3bn, Tesla continues to burn through cash.

The firm said it expected capital expenditures of $1bn in the fourth quarter, bringing its total investments for the second half of the year to $2bn.

And it could face heavy new demands for cash given the delays with the Model 3 and plans for new vehicles."

But did you know that a whole lot of smart people hate Tesla-the-business? “From a return-on-investment-capital standpoint, Tesla is a catastrophe.” “The electric-car maker has been burning money at a clip of about $8,000 a minute (or $480,000 an hour.)” “Tesla is losing a massive amount of money with no competition, and yet massive competition is coming.”

Jim Chanos summarized all of the reasons why nicely: “If you wouldn’t be short a multi-billion-dollar loss-making enterprise in a cyclical business, with a leveraged balance sheet, questionable accounting, every executive leaving, run by a CEO with a questionable relationship with the truth, what would you be short? It sort of ticks all the boxes.” A lot of people think bankruptcy looms in Tesla’s future. Of course, Tesla bears have been saying this for years, and they’ve consistently been wrong — but this time, are they right?

Maybe; maybe not. Either way, a far more interesting question, if (like me) you have no financial interest in the business’s success or failure, is: does it matter?

I’m entirely serious. We tend to assume that a company’s purpose is to make money for its shareholders, or at least “not go bankrupt,” because money is how we measure success. And this is in fact true of most companies. But it is not true of Tesla. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure,” and this is as true of money as it is of any other measure. The purpose of Tesla is not to make money; it is to pioneer fleets of smart mass-market electric cars, and the infrastructure to support them, and battery technology which is not limited to cars. Making money is ancillary.

And whether or not they are making money, they are succeeding at their purpose. They are building the world’s largest factory — in fact, the world’s largest building; it’s still under construction, but parts of it are already up and running. They all but own the luxury electric car market, and are on course to dominate the mass market as well, while also manufacturing power packs.

I’m sure Elon Musk would like to do this while turning a sweet profit. Which is of course also, technically, his fiduciary duty. But if he fails to do so, is that really so tragic? For those of us who aren’t shareholders or bondholders, I mean. (Don’t you worry about Elon, he won’t be missing any meals.)

Maybe it wasn’t even possible to do so — in which case Musk will have used the capital markets to essentially subsidize Tesla with free money. (And, interestingly, open-source the resulting patents.) In which case, you know what, more power to him for managing to fund a loss-making investment in what is not so much a car company as it is infrastructure for our shared future.

After all, even if Tesla stock goes to zero, and its bonds default to pennies-on-the-dollar, its factories and software repositories and human capital will all be there, and no Chapter 11 court or committee will be blind to the fact that they’re worth far more as a coherent unit than they would be as separate assets. The analogy I like to draw is that of the Channel Tunnel, which was privately dug and built, and a complete financial debacle for its investors — “a wonderful thing from which we’ve all benefited, apart from the people who paid for it to be built who lost substantially all their money.”

That quote may yet apply to Tesla. Does it sound unfair to stockholders and bondholders? Not at all: this is capitalism in action, you pays your money and you takes your chances. But if you’re not a stockholder, and not a bondholder, maybe don’t worry so much about headlines screaming about Tesla’s financial unviability. This time, for once, the rest of us win either way."

Tesla is getting into the trucking business. On Thursday, CEO Elon Musk took the wraps off the company's first electric big rig, a semi the company claims is safer and more efficient than any diesel-powered heavy duty truck on the market. (Tesla also unveiled a working prototype of its new Roadster. You can read more about that here.)

Here's a basic breakdown of some its key features:

500 miles of range per charge.

Can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.

0-60 miles per hour in five seconds without a trailer attached.

0-60 miles per hour in 20 seconds while hauling 80,000 pounds of cargo.

Can travel in a convoy where one semi leads other vehicles autonomously.

4 motors on the rear axles.

Windshield is made of impact resistant glass.

""Overall, the Semi is more responsive, covers more miles than a diesel truck in the same amount of time, and more safely integrates with passenger car traffic,"" the company said in a statement.

Tesla

Tesla is so confident in its truck it is guaranteeing that the truck will not break down for one million miles. Musk said production will begin in 2019 and reservations can be made for $5,000.

The truck is safer than other semis because it was designed with a reinforced battery that helps prevent damage upon impact and also gives the truck a very low center of gravity, the company said.

""Its windshield is made of impact resistant glass. Jackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes,"" Tesla said in the statement.

Tesla

But one of the truck's most striking features is the interior of the vehicle, which is designed specifically for the driver.

For starters, there's enough room in the cabin for the driver to stand. And instead of the driver position being on the left, Tesla has centered it so that the driver has better visibility all around the vehicle.

Two touchscreen displays, one on each side of the driver seat, provide access to things like navigation and blind spot monitoring.

Tesla

Tesla's big rig also comes with built-in connectivity, which allows the truck to seamlessly integrate with the fleet's management system to help with routing and scheduling.

Among its other high-tech features, the truck has Enhanced Autopilot which enables automatic braking, lane keeping, and lane departure warning. Cameras on the outside of the vehicle also help detect blind spots and alert the driver when there is a dangerous situation.

Tesla

Tesla, though, isn't the only automaker making a push into electric trucks. Earlier this year, Daimler also showed off an electric heavy duty truck concept that has a range of 220 miles per charge. However, the company has not said when the truck would hit the market."
http://fortune.com/2017/02/09/tesla-california-assembly-plant-shutdown/,pos,1.0,6.456680327493792e-18,Why Tesla Is Shutting Down Its California Assembly Plant for a Week,2017-02-09 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:37:54.951133,,"Tesla said on Wednesday it will shut down production at its California assembly plant for a week this month to prepare for production of its high-volume Model 3 sedan, moving the company closer to meeting its target to start production in July.

Tesla said the “brief, planned” pause would allow the company to add capacity to the existing paint shop to prepare it for the Model 3, and other general maintenance.

“This will allow Tesla to begin Model 3 production later this year as planned and enable us to start the ramp towards 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018,” said a Tesla spokesman.

He added that the pause was not expected to have a material impact on first-quarter production or delivery figures, as the company had added production days to compensate.

Separately, sources told Reuters that the luxury electric carmaker planned to begin test-building the Model 3 on Feb. 20.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last year told investors and more than 370,000 customers who put deposits down for a Model 3 that he intended to start building the cars in July 2017. At the time, many analysts and suppliers said the timeline was too ambitious and would be difficult to achieve, pointing to Tesla’s history of missing aggressive production targets.

If Tesla (tsla) succeeds in starting pilot production of the sedan at its factory in Fremont, California on Feb. 20, as people familiar with the matter told Reuters, the company would be able to share the news with shareholders two days later when it reports fourth-quarter results and better answer any questions about the Model 3 rollout.

‘Stoke the Fan Base’

The sources did not know how many of the highly anticipated vehicles Tesla aimed to build in February, but it would likely be a small number to test the assembly system and the quality of vehicle parts.

“What better way to stoke the fan base and Wall Street than to wheel out pre-production models” ahead of the earnings announcement, said one person familiar with Tesla’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Tesla spokesman declined to comment on the company’s production schedule.

Musk had told investors last year that the company could miss the July 2017 startup target if suppliers do not meet deadlines.

Tesla has a lot riding on the Model 3, which is priced at roughly $35,000 before government incentives. If successful, the sedan could raise Tesla beyond a niche luxury player in the automotive sector.

Tesla has not had a profitable year since going public in 2010, though the company’s $41.4 billion market capitalization now equals that of Nissan Motor (nsany), which reported a profit of $4.7 billion last year.

Musk’s bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla, but skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year by 2018.

That would expand Tesla’s annual production by four to five times compared to 2016 levels. In its fourth quarter, Tesla produced 24,882 vehicles.

Tesla disclosed in May that it had taken 373,000 refundable $1,000 deposits for the Model 3, underscoring its appeal ahead of production. The company has not since updated that number. Total sales of fully electric vehicles last year in the United States amounted to just 84,275 vehicles, according to data compiled by the Electric Drive Transportation Association.

Moving Design Target

Sources with knowledge of the Model 3 timeline had called it extremely aggressive, with challenges compounded by Tesla making last-minute changes to the car’s design. Such design tweaks can delay production, and add cost as suppliers rework tools and molds to meet new specifications.

Musk said in July the design of the Model 3 was complete. The car, he told shareholders earlier in May, would be “easy to make” and free of the complicated design that led to production delays in the Model X sports utility vehicle.

It is common practice for automakers to make minor adjustments to a “finished” design for a variety of reasons, ranging from fit and finish to safety.

One source said last week that design changes were still underway for the Model 3, which could potentially hinder the ramp-up to full production. Tesla declined to comment on whether the design was still being tinkered with.

Tesla’s previous launches for the Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle were marked by production delays and initial quality issues.

That track record meant some analysts were skeptical that Musk would launch production by July. “We assume 0 Model 3 deliveries in ’17,” Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a Jan. 3 note, while Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas in a Jan. 19 note said he expected a “soft launch” of the Model 3 to be delayed until late 2017."

The idea is reminiscent of 2014's "" Twitch Plays Pokémon,"" where more than a million Twitch viewers all shared control of the classic Nintendo Game Boy game.

But this ain't no game: Mike Roberts, the Seattle-based Amazon engineer behind StockStream, is letting players vote on how to invest $50,000 of his actual savings on the real-life stock market. So far, about 60,000 people have come through to play along, or at least gawk at the spectacle.

Roberts says that the idea for something like this has been kicking around the web for years, with users of sites like Reddit letting anonymous commenters vote on the next stock they should buy. Now, after six months of work, Roberts has debuted StockStream as a more focused, and applied, version of that concept.

""After the first day, I'm a lot more bullish than I already was"" about the game, says Roberts.

The way StockStream works is simple: Every five minutes, a round of voting opens, allowing Twitch viewers to vote on the purchase or sale of any stock, like ""!buy AAPL"" or !sell TSLA."" After five minutes, the relevant stocks get added to or subtracted from Roberts' portfolio, with the trade executing via the popular Robinhood app.

Robinhood, the stock trading app that's helping facilitate StockStream. Robinhood

Players are then scored on how their stocks performed. If you suggest buying Apple, and it pops right after the trade is made, you get points. But if it dives, your score is docked accordingly. Roberts says that the current scoring system is confusing for a lot of players, and will likely be revamped, but those are the basic rules.

There's no prize or payouts for players with the most points. It's more about the fun of participating a financial crowdsourcing experiment.

As for Roberts, so far the wisdom of the crowd has him treading water. After day one, Roberts still has about $26,000 cash on hand, with a total account value — cash on hand, plus the value of his stocks — of about $50,055.92

Win or lose

Roberts says he was a little concerned, going in, about trolls stomping all over the fun social experiment he had envisioned by purposely trying to derail his portfolio and lose him money. A few odd choices like Cheesecake Factory and Papa John's aside, though, he says that players have chosen for him ""a reasonable, diversified portfolio"" that includes hot tech stocks like AMD, Tesla, and Apple.

StockStream viewers can make donations to Roberts, but as of day one, that hasn't happened very much, nor does he expect it to. He does say that a fair amount of StockStream viewers are signing up for Robinhood via his referral link, which nets him a ""free"" stock bonus for the portfolio when they make their first trade. Otherwise, it's almost entirely his money that's on the line.

""Twitch Plays Pokemon,"" the phenomenon that inspired StockStream. Twitch Plays Pokemon

Roberts says he hasn't really considered a way for players to ""win"" at StockStream. He feels like it would be disingenuous and discouraging if he told players that their goal was something as straightforward as doubling his money; he's really in it for the love of the game.

There is, however, a losing condition. Because of FINRA regulations for the category of day trading that he falls into, Roberts has to make sure that his total account balance (again, cash plus the value of his stocks) stays above $25,000. If it dips below, he won't legally be allowed to trade anymore, and so the game is over. So while his account is a little over twice that today, he acknowledges that there's an element of financial danger to the game.

""If a lot of these [stocks] start crashing tomorrow, then things could get dicey,"" says Roberts."

That makes logo design a very important task.

Tesla's logo is certainly not anonymous, but it turns out there's more to it than may be immediately apparent.

What looks like simply a stylized ""T"" is actually a reference to the company's products, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a recent tweet.

The Tesla logo is intended to represent the cross-section of an electric motor, Musk explained to a querying Twitter follower.

Musk seemed to be referring to the main body of the ""T"" as representing one of the poles that stick out of a motor's rotor, with the second line on top representing a section of the stator.

Repeating the Tesla logo in a circle, with the top of each ""T"" facing outward, does indeed create a reasonable facsimile of an electric-motor cross-section. (Motor architectures can vary considerably, so take this as a simplified explanation.)

In this respect, it matches the logo of SpaceX, another of Musk's ventures—which in this case designs and builds rockets, and contracts to send payloads into orbit.

The stylized ""X"" in the SpaceX logo is meant to represent a rocket trajectory, Musk said in his tweets.

Both logos were designed by RO-Studio, a design firm based in New Jersey.

Compared to those of Tesla and SpaceX, the logo of Musk's third major venture is relatively straightforward.

SolarCity's logo includes a sun graphic, representing the power source for the company's solar panels.

Musk negotiated Tesla's purchase of SolarCity last year, citing anticipated synergies between solar energy and Tesla's energy-storage battery business.

SolarCity was previously controlled by Musk and members of his family, but had been a separate corporate entity from Tesla.

The SolarCity acquisition is the latest indication that Musk views Tesla as more than just an automaker.

Recently, the company officially re-branded itself as simply ""Tesla Inc."" from ""Tesla Motors.""

Last year, it acquired the rights to the domain name ""Tesla.com"" after roughly 10 years of trying, and has since adopted it as the domain for its website."

The reveal comes from a recent filing in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showing a simplified moniker: “Tesla Inc.”

The rebranding decision makes perfect sense taking into account Tesla is more than just a car manufacturer as it also wants to make and sell other products, including solar roofs and Powerwall 2 batteries for both homeowners and businesses. Rather than selling these energy products under the SolarCity brand following a $2.3-billion acquisition, Tesla will use its own name.

The solar roof panels are slated to go on sale later this year and according to Elon Musk the installation costs will be just about the same as those of a standard roof. To boost production, the solar panels are going to be manufactured by Panasonic at its factory in Buffalo, New York.

As for the batteries for the second-gen Powerwall and the Powerpack energy-storage systems, most of them are going to be made at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada where mass production of the 2170 lithium-ion cells kicked off early last month.

Getting back to the name change, Tesla’s decision to lose the “Motors” from its official moniker reminds us of a similar move made by Apple about a decade ago. In early January 2007, it changed its name from “Apple Computer” to “Apple Inc.” as a way to better reflect the company has a broader array of products to offer.

Tesla, Inc. picked up SolarCity in late 2016, a solar power company founded by Musk’s cousins where he also acted as chairman of the board. Tesla also introduced its second-generation Powerwall battery storage device for home use last year, as well as its Powerpack 2.0 commercial solar energy storage solution. The company also revealed plans to create solar roof panels that look like ordinary roof tiles, which it aims to begin shipping to customers later this year.

The company changed its website URL from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com last year, and it lists itself as “not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation” in its official ‘about’ page, so the official name change was a long time coming."

Musk has not been shy about how his ambitions for Tesla run way past just electric cars. Last July he unveiled his second version of the company’s “Master Plan,” which laid out his vision for Tesla’s future. Musk wants to use the company to “create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage, expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments, develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning, [and] enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.”

Tesla is building a massive factory in Nevada to produce lithium ion batteries that can power its electric vehicles and also store electricity produced by solar energy systems that use SolarCity's solar panels.

The Tesla Semi has a single gear and uses four electric motors that operate independently to power its rear wheels. “It’s smooth. It’s just like driving a Tesla.” said CEO Elon Musk at the truck’s unveiling event. “It’s though you’re driving a Model S, a Model X, or Model 3, it’s just big.”

In addition to having a consumer-car-like driving experience, Tesla Semi’s four drivetrains is designed with efficiency in mind and acts as a redundant system. “You can lose two of the four motors, and the truck will still keep going. In fact, even if you have only two of the four motors active it will still beat a diesel truck.” says Musk. He also noted the drivetrain’s safety benefits, adding “the truck will automatically stop jackknifing because it has independent motors on each wheel and it will dynamically adjust the torque on each wheel so that jackknifing is impossible. Your worse nightmare is gone with this truck.”

A little known fact about Tesla’s semi-truck is that it uses the same electric motors found on the Model 3, as a way for the company to maximize production efficiency while maintaining higher gross margins. “Most of that semi is actually made out of Model 3 parts, by the way.” said Musk earlier in the year during a call with analysts. “We’re able to use a very high volume vehicle, and then combine several motors … I think it’s actually going to have a very good gross margin.”

YouTuber and Tesla community veteran, KmanAuto, who gave us a first look at Tesla’s “Megacharger” charging port, happened to also capture details of the semi-truck’s massive battery pack and drivetrain assembly.

Kman’s latest video provides an in-depth look at the rear electric motors, seen mounted to the two rear axles on the Tesla Semi, and the powertrain’s high voltage cables. We also catch a glimpse of the part number and serial number for the semi-truck’s rear axle and gearbox, by way of his camera’s night vision capabilities."

Fred and Seth already both covered this car, but it’s so groundbreaking that I felt I needed to chime in.

And as a current Roadster 1.5 owner, which had been my dream car ever since seeing the first introductory website put up by Tesla way back in 2006, I’m writing this article as a sort of catharsis, a reliving of that night that I first saw the car I sorely wished could be mine but thought at the time I’d never have the opportunity to own.

This article will be a bit of a deeper dive into some of the specs, how they may have been attained, with whatever speculation and Roadster-owner-experience I can throw in. I’ll try to explain the concepts I go over, not because I feel our readers won’t understand them, but just in the interest of completeness and in reaching as wide an audience as possible.

Quick disclaimer, I’m not actually an engineer. The explanations of the concepts within should be accurate as an introduction to these concepts, though since this is the internet, I’m sure I’ll hear otherwise in the comments if anything is wrong. So if you’re ready to engage in a little bit of bench racing, some explanations of many aspects of vehicle dynamics and how they relate to the new Roadster, let’s dig right in to the specs of the car that Tesla CEO Elon Musk said will “give a hard-core smack down to gasoline powered cars.”

Power

First thing’s first, let’s talk about the go-fast stuff. With Tesla’s stated specs, and with that huge battery, this car must have a lot of power. The 200kWh battery isn’t just there for range, it’s for power. Power (kW) is how much “oomph” you can deliver instantaneously, as opposed to energy (kWh) which is the amount of storage you have and thus how far you can go.

The batteries Tesla uses tend to have relatively low power density and higher energy density, so to get a lot of power, you need a lot of batteries (as opposed to, say, supercapacitors, which have great power density but bad energy density). This is why Teslas with larger batteries tend to have more power, and consequently quicker acceleration.

The original Roadster had an at-the-time massive 53kWh battery, which gave it ample low-end torque and good power for such a small car. However, getting up into the higher speeds, there wasn’t quite as much “oomph.” While the car will throw your head back violently up to about 50mph, there’s a little bit to be desired past that speed (not that it’s deficient, it’s just not as violent).

Tesla designed the original Roadster with a two-speed transmission in the hope of attaining similar 60-120 acceleration as 0-60 acceleration, but it didn’t work out and Tesla updated all cars to the “1.5” powertrain, which was simpler and improved performance in many ways.

Since then, Tesla has gone with single gears – though the dual-motor versions of the Model S have different ratios on the front and rear axle, which helps efficiency when cruising at higher speeds. It’s likely that Tesla will do the same with the Roadster, and have the front motor geared more for top speed and the rear motors geared for acceleration.

In the new Roadster, there is no sense of a loss of “oomph” even as high as 80mph (which is about as fast as the test rides went at the unveiling event).

The only number Tesla gave us related to power during the unveiling was 10,000Nm, which is equivalent to 7,375ft•lbs of torque (*see edit below). 10,000Nm of torque is basically unheard of in anything with wheels.

(*Edit: a reader points out in the comments that Tesla was quoting “torque at the wheels” rather than the torque coming out of the engine/motor. The difference is that the former number is torque after being mutiplied by the gearing in the car’s transmission – which should be a ratio of around 9:1 as it is on most of Tesla’s cars. On Tesla’s website, it specifies “wheel torque,” but during the event just the word “torque” was used. Normally cars quote torque coming out of the engine, so it seems like Tesla was overhyping this spec and I got a little overzealous in reporting it uncritically. Regardless, the Model S has 930Nm of torque so the Roadster will probably still have around ~1,100Nm of torque, and this is still an obnoxiously high number, on par with the most torquey cars in existence)

With those ridiculous torque numbers, given that we’ve seen a Model X out-drag an Alfa Romeo while towing an Alfa Romeo, it almost makes you feel like a Roadster could accomplish the same feat. Unfortunately, it is quite unlikely that the Roadster will have a tow hitch – even though Tesla CTO JB Straubel put one on his original Roadster (disclaimer: DO NOT DO THIS – a sportscar’s suspension and chassis are not built for it and it will certainly be contra-indicated by the owner’s manual).

But torque and power are not the same – torque gets you off the line, power gets you up to high speeds. Also, peak torque doesn’t mean much (peak horsepower perhaps means even less). Horsepower is calculated by (torque * rpm) / 5252. Most car specs are quoted in “peak” numbers, but due to the way “torque curves” work on ICE engines, those peak horsepower numbers may only be available within a specific rpm range – this is why ICE cars have so many gears, to try to stay in the best rpm range for the motor.

A “torque curve” shows how much torque and power an engine develops at various points in the RPM range – so a “peaky” torque curve may have a high peak number, but what you really want is an engine which can provide good torque and hp across a broad portion of the rpm range (Tesla talked about that briefly near the end of this old blog post). For an example of how this looks, in this graph torque is the solid line and horsepower is the dotted line – the x-axis is labeled in speed because in a single-gear transmission, speed and RPM are directly related:

The Model S motor can spin up to ~18,000rpm and the original Roadster up to ~14,000, so we can expect similar rpms from the new Roadster. Electric motors provide maximum torque at 0rpm, which is why they have such dominant performance in initial acceleration. Then they have a flat torque curve until some point at which torque drops off depending on how much power can be delivered by the battery. Since horsepower is torque times rpm, as the torque drops off and the rpms go up, horsepower remains roughly flat even after torque begins to drop, then horsepower drops off slowly at even higher speeds.

Since the new Roadster’s quoted torque number is so much higher than anything reasonable, it’s likely that the Roadster will only be able to sustain 10,000Nm for just the initial launch, maybe up to ~1,000rpm – and it probably will have a tough time delivering all of those 10,000Nm to the ground, due to the limitations of traction (see Tires section below for more on that).

As for power, given that the battery is about twice the size of the Model S, which Tesla claims can produce 778hp (more on that here), I’m estimating that power will be in the megawatt range, so around 1,300 horsepower. Give or take.

There are a few other megawatt cars out there, but they are rare and each costs over a million dollars. The Rimac Concept_S makes a megawatt of power, and does so with an 82kWh pack, as does the NIO EP9. Then there are custom built Pike’s Peak racers, the Koeniggsegg Regera and the aforementioned Bugatti Chiron in this category. Notably, the “big three” hybrid hypercars right now, the Porsche 918, MclarenP1 and LaFerrari all do not make a megawatt of power. Even Formula One cars don’t make that much power.

And this power seems like it should be enough to reach Tesla’s stated top speed of 250mph+, accounting for drag at high speeds.

Aerodynamics

If Tesla wants to reach over 250mph (400kmph) with this car, it’s going to take a lot of horsepower to overcome air drag at that speed. But according to the drag equation, this should be readily attainable. For reference, I used a drag coefficient (Cd) of .35 (similar to the .36 of the Bugatti Chiron mentioned in the presentation), and I used the new NSX’s frontal area as the two cars look kind of similar (19 sqft or 1.78 square meters).

So at 250mph, the Roadster would need roughly 750hp (560kW) to overcome air drag given these assumptions. But as stated before, it seems like the Roadster could have somewhere in the ballpark of a megawatt of power, and the car will likely have a lower Cd than my estimate, though perhaps not by too much, since low coefficients aren’t necessarily the only goal of a sportscar.

Back on the Bugatti Chiron for a moment, in the presentation on the Tesla Semi, Musk mentioned that the Semi has the same Cd as a Bugatti Chiron. This was somewhat of a meaningless comparison – supercars are meant to be a little bit draggy, because if they slipped through the air too well, then they’d lift right up off the road. This is why you see wings (aka spoilers) and active aerodynamic features on cars which are meant to travel at such high speeds. The Roadster does include one of these, as you can see in the press shot below.

Wings work by disturbing the air, pushing the air upwards to produce an opposite and equal force downwards on the car, called downforce. This aids cars in cornering and also helps them stick to the road at very high speeds, because there is a natural lift created by a vehicle going at very high speeds, somewhat like an airplane wing (see NASA’s “racing physics” page for a little more on this). Formula One is the epitome of fast racing cars, and they have a Cd of roughly .7 – because they need as much downforce as possible to take turns at the incredibly high speeds they do.

But since wings push air around, they do create drag, so it’s best to focus on the most “aerodynamically efficient” devices. Aerodynamic efficiency refers to the ability to create downforce with as little drag as possible. The underbody of a car is often a good location to focus on for aerodynamic efficiency. Tesla has a benefit here, because by placing the battery at the bottom of the car, they can have a naturally very flat underbody. Also, the rear end of the car has quite a large “diffuser,” which is a device meant to keep the air flowing steadily under the car, as undisturbed as possible. The diffuser is the big carbon fiber bit in the photo below:

By allowing air to flow quickly and undisturbed under the car, not only do you create less drag (turbulent air is more draggy), you also create some downforce. This is very important to reach high top speeds, because it helps “suck” the car down to the road. It also aids in cornering, as traction increases when there is more downward force on the tires.

Tires

The tires on the prototype are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 325/30ZR21 (104Y) rear and 295/35ZR20 front. These have a “Y” speed rating, which means they have a maximum speed of “over 186mph (300kmph).” They are the same tires used on the Porsche 918 Spyder (which has a 211mph/340kmph top speed).

These are listed as “streetable track & competition” tires, which means they are legal to drive on a public road, but are focused on track performance and are not meant to be driven in wet conditions. This may be the reason some Roadster test rides experienced wheelspin during low-end acceleration, as there was a light sprinkle of rain during the event, and on a smooth and dusty runway this can make for a slippy experience. You can hear the wheelspin 5 seconds into Seth’s 360º Roadster Test Ride video.

The numbers I talked about above refer to the size of the tires. The first number is the width of the tire in millimeters, the last number is the size of the rim in inches, and the middle number is the “aspect ratio” of the actual tire itself (bigger numbers = thicker tires, smaller = skinny “rubber band” tires). The width of the tires is of particular note, as 325/295 are very wide. The original Roadster had tires of 225/175, so the new tires are roughly ~70% wider. Combine this with the larger diameter of the rim-tire combo, and the “contact patch,” the amount of rubber which hits the road, is probably almost double what the original Roadster’s contact patch is.

The reason for this is partially because the new Roadster is heavier than the original Roadster (heavier vehicles typically need larger tires and have larger contact patches), but primarily because the only way to get a sub-2-second 0-60 time is to have a whole lot of rubber in contact with the road. Since the only way power gets transferred into forward motion is by the friction of tires against the road, the more rubber you can have in contact with the road, and the stickier that rubber is, the more forward motion you get.

Not only that, but the original Roadster is only rear-wheel drive, rather than all-wheel drive. This is why all-wheel drive cars tend to accelerate better than front- or rear-wheel drive cars, because they’re using all four tires to push the car forward, instead of just two (though the rear wheels do more of the work, since the car’s weight leans backwards upon acceleration).

All of this can be seen in action in the case of the P100D Model S, which has roughly the same 0-60 time as it does 60-0 time. This means that for the entirety of the 0-60 acceleration period, the car is moving forward as quickly as the tires allow – the only way to make it go quicker would be to give it bigger tires or less weight, more power is superfluous when you are “traction-limited.”

The downside to larger tires and more grip is that the car is less efficient than it would be with smaller tires, but I would still expect an MPGe rating somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 even despite that, and honestly, that’s not really the main point of this car now is it? The tires are also more expensive ($600 per tire on TireRack), but, again, it’s a hypercar. That comes with the territory.

Large tires also mean more grip for cornering, which will be necessary because the new Roadster seems like it will be significantly heavier than the original one.

Weight

The original Roadster focused a lot on staying light weight. The chassis was designed and manufactured in collaboration with Lotus Engineering. Lotus was started by legendary car designer Colin Chapman, whose philosophy is often summarized as “simplify, then add lightness.” The idea is that to make a car perform better, you don’t “add” more weight, more power, more tires, etc., you try to remove every bit of superfluous weight you can, because the lighter your car is, the better it will be in all aspects of vehicle performance.

As a result, the whole car came in at 2,723lbs (1,235kg). This is very light – it’s heavier than similar light, two-seater convertible roadsters like the Lotus Elise and Mazda MX-5 due to the battery, but lighter than almost any production car available today, even hypercars like the LaFerrari (2766lbs/1255kg). Though it could really benefit from the weight savings that a newer, more energy dense battery would provide – like the Roadster 3.0 battery update, only with the original 53kWh usable capacity and lighter, newer cells. The re-engineering required and low production number of the original Roadster make this an unlikely thing to happen, though.

The weight of the car is probably going to be slightly rear-biased, as the tires in the rear are larger and the rear has two motors, with just one in the front. The original Roadster also had heavily rear-biased weight because the battery was placed behind the seats, which helped a lot with traction to get the at-the-time-incredible sub-4 second 0-60 time.

It’s unlikely that the new Roadster will manage anything close to the original Roadster’s weight. The aforementioned 200kWh battery will be heavy – very heavy. The current 100kWh pack in a Model S weighs more than 1,000lbs (453kg). Even with the next couple years of battery advancement, it seems likely to me that the pack alone will be close to 2,000lbs (907kg). Then add three electric motors, seats, a (probably aluminum) chassis, and a body which felt like it was made of either carbon fiber or fiberglass, and this car seems like it will be, at minimum, in the mid-high 3,000s or possibly above 4,000lbs (1814kg). The body is likely carbon fiber given the price – there were many carbon fiber accents in the prototype’s interior, see dash in picture below:

That would be a lot heavier than the original Roadster, but it’s not out of line compared to other hypercars available today. Most of them are in the ~3,500lb range, and the Bugatti Chiron is 4,400lbs (1,996kg). Weight isn’t a big disadvantage in terms of straight-line top speed, as it’s easier to keep a lot of weight moving than to get it moving in the first place. But weight is a disadvantage when it comes to cornering ability and vehicle handling.

Handling

This is my one area of concern with the Roadster’s performance. Weight is absolutely critical in terms of cornering ability, there is nothing more important. The more your car weighs, the harder it is to get to change directions, period. Cornering requires applying a force to change the car’s velocity vector (the direction and speed it’s moving), and the heavier that car is, the more force will be required to change that vector. So, the more “lightness” you can “add” to your car, the better it will turn.

So from this perspective, the Roadster’s gigantic battery seems excessive. Such a huge battery is pretty important to reach the power levels which Tesla wanted to hit with this car, but this will cause a deficit in vehicle handling as compared to a smaller car.

There are some ways to mitigate this though. As mentioned earlier, the huge tires help a lot with any kind of grip. Having roughly twice the contact patch of the original Roadster means twice as much rubber on the road, which means twice as much friction, which means the tires can “push” twice as hard around the corner before losing grip.

Another mitigating factor is the car’s center of gravity. A car with a high center of gravity will introduce more “roll” when going around a corner, which means the weight of the car will lean onto the tires on the outside of the turn. If there’s more weight on the outside tires, that means there’s less weight on the inside tires, and the inside tires are no longer going to be as effective in providing grip to help turn the car around the corner.

A low center of gravity reduces roll, which means the inside tires stay stuck to the ground better, and in turn provide more grip. This is how the Model S tends to out-handle other vehicles of the same weight, because it has an exceptionally low center of gravity – about 17.5 inches. This is on par with the Ford GT and lower than the Ferrari 458 and Subaru BRZ, which are all famously low-slung cars, whereas the Model S is a 5(+2) seat sedan.

All of the same principles apply to braking – it’s harder to slow down a heavier vehicle, but with a large contact patch (more grip) and a low center of gravity (less “dive”, so the rear wheels stay in better contact with the road), you can make a vehicle brake more effectively.

Finally, the Roadster’s two rear motors can probably also be used for a concept called “torque vectoring,” where the electric motors are used to apply different amounts of torque to the inner and outer tire – assuming the motors have each been designed to control an individual rear wheel. When going around a corner, if the inner wheel provides some negative torque relative to the speed of the car, it can help to turn the car in the desired direction.

That said, even with all this mitigation to help handling, I would still like to see “lightness” play a big role in the design of the car. Because the better a car’s handling, the better its track performance.

Track performance?

Tesla’s cars have, as of yet, not had fantastic track performance. The Roadster can complete a couple hot laps on a typical ~2-3 mile (3-5km) long track before the battery gets too hot to continue, and the Model S couldn’t quite complete a full lap of the Nurburgring (~13 miles/20km) before it had to cut power. But neither of those cars were really designed for track performance – the Roadster was intended as a sportscar but was a “first-try” and more of a proof-of-concept than anything, intended to show that EVs are cool and quick.

And Tesla doesn’t have a racing heritage and hasn’t put effort into joining any racing series. These decisions currently make business sense for them, because racing is typically motivated in large part by marketing. Automakers of performance vehicles brag about racing wins to sell cars – “win on Sunday, sell on Monday” is a common saying in the auto industry. Since Tesla has been supply-limited for some time and will continue to be, and doesn’t even have TV advertisements, sinking a lot of their marketing budget into forming a racing team may not be the wisest business decision.

That said, we’re in a different time now than we were when the original Roadster came out. When the Roadster came out, people thought EVs were slow and unappealing, and Tesla changed that. Tesla has continually gone on to prove most of the excuses people make about EVs are misguided, and they’ve shown that their cars are faster than everything else on the road at every practical speed. Even the drag strip is now the domain of EVs. The only domain left is the track.

There have been various EV efforts to show off that EVs can do well on tracks – Panoz is working on a battery-swapping Le Mans EV for next year, Faraday Future and Lightning Motorcycles have both conquered Pike’s Peak (and last year a privateer modified Model S), and the NIO EP9 recently beat every production car ever around the Nurburgring. But none of those efforts are as high-profile as Tesla, and they’re being done with cars that are not readily available.

So Musk’s tweet on Saturday gets the imagination going:

Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 19, 2017

On some of the million-dollar hypercars the new Roadster is meant to “smack down,” there are special “competition packages” available which are meant to make the cars more track-focused. Think the Porsche 918 “Weissach package,” which sets buyers back an additional $84,000 for a few lighter components saving ~80lbs/36kg (magnesium wheels, more carbon fiber) and aerodynamic modifications, for very little change in performance numbers, but a more nimble track experience.

Does Musk’s tweet mean we’ll get a similar track-focused package on the new Roadster? Or will it just be something more like Tesla’s traditional “performance” packages, with just a little more power, maybe a tenth or two faster 0-60 time, maybe slightly wider rear tires and slightly modified suspension (as the short-lived “plus” package did for the Model S).

I certainly would like to see something track-focused. But the track is a difficult place to operate. There are a lot of uncommon stresses on cars, and drivers will intentionally push every aspect of vehicle performance to the absolute limit – because unless you’re beating your car to its limits, what’s the point of even being on the track in the first place?

The achilles heel of the original Roadster in terms of track performance is battery temperature. Lithium ion batteries cannot operate at as high a temperature as internal combustion engines, and while they produce less heat than an ICE (heat is just wasted energy, after all), they still produce quite a bit of heat when every cell is pushing out the maximum amount of electrons as it can.

Electric motors can also get quite hot, but have a higher operating temperature than the battery does. That said, Electric GT racing series, which promises to start racing stripped-down Teslas against one another soon, has focused much of their work on cooling the vehicles and have identified that the Model S’ “stator”, the stationary outer part of the electric motor, as a potential point of high-temperature caution. But the stator is relatively easy to cool, given that it is not a moving part and there’s just one heat source, the stator itself, compared to thousands of individual battery cells which make up the complicated liquid cooling system of a Tesla battery.

So the main thing Tesla needs to manage for track performance, if they do intend the new Roadster to be track-capable (or to have a track upgrade package, which is what I would like to believe Musk is referring to in his tweet), is temperatures. And the second thing is weight (please Tesla, do everything you can to keep weight down!).

On the topic of temperatures and weight, one way which track cars manage both is by having carbon ceramic disc brakes, which are slightly lighter, much more expensive, and offer similar stopping distance to steel brake discs but reduce “fade” which comes from repeated heavy braking events. Since braking produces a lot of temperature from friction, steel tends to warp and fade when put under stress, and carbon can operate at much higher temperatures. A reader pointed out that the tire photos above seem to show that the new Roadster looks to have carbon ceramic brake discs.

While carbon brakes do last longer than steel brakes, this is not really a consideration for an electric vehicle as EV brakes already tend to last extremely long anyway (because regenerative braking doesn’t require using friction brakes). And they are also lighter, which helps reduce rotating and unsprung mass which aids in handling, but the cost is quite expensive for the amount of weight saved. We’re talking maybe ~30 lbs saved at costs of $10,000 or more, at least for most carbon brake kits out there.

So the primary reason to have these on the new Roadster would be for track performance (or for show, and of course, the photo is of a show car so this could be the reason). If these do make their way to production they will likely be an option or part of a track package as they are quite expensive and of limited use, but this is an indication that Tesla may offer some sort of track-focused options on the car.

Other nice things to have would be a little more downforce from something more than the tiny moveable wing at the back, maybe some instruments above the steering wheel or on a heads-up display instead of on the center screen, and adjustable racing suspension components for greater control over the vehicle’s handling characteristics (original Roadster offered adjustable suspension as an option). Then just make a battery swapping robot and beat everyone at Le Mans…

Conclusion

As a Roadster 1.5 owner, I’m glad Tesla is getting so much press for this new car – partially because nobody knows my car exists. When people see my 2008 Roadster, the most common question I get is: “is that the new Tesla?” This even happened about two hours before the reveal event, in the parking lot before dinner.

From the stated specs of the new Roadster, it looks like it beats everything. And not only does it beat everything, it kind of beats everything at everything. It beats in 0-60, it beats in 0-100, it beats in quarter mile, and depending on how much faster than 250mph it can go, it looks like it’s within a shout of the production top speed record too. Depending on how they do with track performance, it might beat them at the track as well, but it looks like it at least will be close.

Tesla does tend to hype products up, but even with the crazy specs they announce, they usually tend to deliver on those specs (albeit, sometimes, a little bit late). And given the analysis above, these specs do seem to be within the realm of physical possibility.

It does all of this at a $200k base price, which is a lot, but “relatively affordable” compared to the million-dollar supercars and hypercars it compares against (and if you’ve enjoyed the effort I put into this analysis, then you can help me own one by using my Tesla referral code if you’re thinking about getting a Model S or X or a Tesla solar roof).

This car is already going to blow everything else away in most aspects of performance, but if Tesla manages to make this car track-capable, or releases a track-focused version of the car (with less weight? pretty please?), it’s the final nail in a coffin which Tesla has already been banging nails into for the last 9 years. All the internal combustion engine will have left is “yeah, but mine makes a lot of noise.” Okay, great. Noise is inefficiency. Every decibel your engine produces is another watt that isn’t making it to the road. If you want to go fast, buy a Tesla. If you want noise, buy some speakers. See you in the rear view mirror, combustion.

But competition could start to heat up relatively soon, according to one analyst.

For now, Tesla seems to be in a class of its own, and enjoys a considerable lead over competitors. It has no rivals in the high-end electric car segment, and enthusiasm for the Model 3, based on reservations, has far outpaced the interest in similarly priced electric cars. These include the already available Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf.

But Tesla will face a bevy of competitors in the next few years, especially among high end carmakers with strong brands of their own, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, who has been a consistent skeptic of the California electric car maker and renewable energy company, even though Tesla stock has risen more than 50 percent this year alone.

""We can just hear the Tesla fans objections to the volume of competitor launches – most of those are mass market cars, and many are compliance cars — and hence not appealing to the status-conscious Tesla target segment,"" Johnson said in his note to clients on Friday.

Recently, Barclays hosted a powertrain conference in London, where several high-end auto companies showed off their planned electric offerings.

From what he saw there, along with recent announcements from manufacturers, Johnson said legacy luxury automakers will begin a launch cadence in 2019 that will distribute a broad selection of electric vehicles across several brands by 2021.

""In particular at our conference, we were impressed by Mercedes' plans for the EQ brand as a standalone platform for EVs from inception, "" Johnson said. ""We think Mercedes' strategy will stand them in good stead in the long run.""

He added that BMW will produce early electric vehicles on existing architectures, but will also develop a standalone platform as it builds scale. He expects Mercedes and BMW to have four models each, and Volkswagen to have seven — three from Audi, two from Porsche and one Bentley.

Maserati, Jaguar and Aston Martin are each expected to have one model.

Whether any of these will be able to truly challenge Tesla remains to be seen. But each could conceivably take significant slices out of the market share Tesla all but controls now.

Johnson also thinks, along with many others, that China will be the key growth market for electric vehicles over the next several years, and Tesla is at a great disadvantage to Chinese makers who all but dominate the Chinese market.

Tesla's Model S and X cars compete with 19 Chinese electric vehicle models in that country, by his count. Local regulations favor local companies, and Chinese models typically sell better than Tesla cars, according to his report. Both Daimler and GM have plans to source battery cells in China as well.

Still, some analysts have expressed skepticism that traditional auto companies pose a great threat to Tesla. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas, for example, said in a note published in April that traditional automakers tend to profit more from cars with internal combustion engines, and was doubtful that shareholders would reward companies for pursuing ""money-losing electrics.""

Jonas said that Tesla's true competitors may end up being tech companies instead.

To be sure, Tesla has a considerable lead on competitors and has a strong brand. So far the company has had the high-end electric vehicle market to itself.

The company proved that electric cars could offer luxury and high performance and be highly desirable to consumers. They are now aiming to prove that they can also offer at least some of that performance and design at a lower price.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has at times encouraged other companies to make electric cars. In 2014, Tesla released all the patents it held at the time ""in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology,"" Musk said in a blog post.

The market for electric cars is still tiny—only about 1 percent of all cars sold. It is likely about to become quite a bit more crowded.

Tesla was not immediately available for comment."

The Gigafactory, about 5.5 million square feet, would help the company dramatically cut the cost of its batteries once it's fully operational in 2018 by ""using economies of scale, innovative manufacturing, reduction of waste, and the simple optimization of locating most manufacturing process under one roof.""

In fact, Tesla has said it will create more battery cells at the Gigafactory than all of the lithium-ion battery makers combined did in 2013."

FREMONT, Calif. — It has been touted as Tesla’s first “mass-market” electric car — one that would lower the entry barrier into the company’s luxury niche.

Tesla rolled out the long-awaited Model 3 the first 30 recipients Friday night in Fremont, Calif., and prospective buyers, auto industry insiders, tech enthusiasts and anyone who has shelled out a $1,000 reservation deposit will undoubtedly be looking to see whether the car lives up to its billing as a vehicle with broad appeal.

For many, the breadth of that appeal hinges on the price tag.

Before the rollout event, Tesla had released few details about the pricing structure of its new car, noting that it would start at $35,000 and that people would be able to customize some features. A fully equipped Model 3 would cost about $60,000, according to the company late Friday.

[Here’s what we know about Tesla’s Model 3]

Rebates in a handful of states could lower the price for eligible customers. There is also a $7,500 federal income tax credit. But that tax credit only lasts until the company reaches 200,000 electric vehicles sold in the United States, and Tesla has already sold more than 100,000 vehicles. And the company announced at the event that there are half a million reservations for the Model 3.

A variety of customizations, such as motor options, greater battery life, enhanced autopilot and larger wheels, could push the Model 3’s price well above $40,000, analysts say. At that cost, experts say, the Model 3 would soar past the price of the average new car sold in the United States, as well as any vehicle that might be considered mass-market. Analysts say the Model 3 is an aspirational vehicle.

“The average transaction price for a new car is about $36,000,” said Rebecca Lindland, an executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “That’s the sweet spot that new car buyers can afford.” Lindland noted that mass-market buyers aren’t necessarily part of the middle class.

She expects the Model 3 to appeal to a category of buyers known as “early adopters.” These are consumers who are slightly more risk averse and have less wealth than the “innovators” who purchased the Model X and the Model S.

Each year, roughly five percent of Americans buy a new car. Auto prices hit an all-time high in 2o16, increasing 2.7 percent from the year before and nearly 13 percent since 2011, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks auto prices. Yet, despite rising auto prices, people are still buying cars in record numbers in the United States. Sales for 2016 set a record of 17.6 million cars and trucks, an increase over the 17.5 million vehicles sold the year before, according to figures from sales tracker Autodata.

To make those purchases possible, analysts say, growing numbers of new-car buyers are stretching loans longer than ever before. The average car loan is $30,534, and the average time lien holders take to pay it off is 68 months, according to Experian. But analysts say new-car buyers are stretching loans out for as long as 84 months, or seven years. Personal finance experts have advised that people keep auto loans to four years.

“I think a lot of folks will be leasing the Model 3,” Bankrate.com analyst Claes Bell said. “In the U.S., the median household income is $56,516 dollars. At that income, a lot of folks are going to have a hard time affording a vehicle around $30,000 in price, much less anything higher.”

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has made clear his desire to bring “compelling mass market electric cars” to the world, noting in a 2013 blog post that if the company could have achieved that mission with its first product, it would have. Due to the limitations of a start-up, Musk wrote, Tesla opted to build a sports car that had the “best chance of being competitive with its gasoline alternatives.” He said that Tesla’s initial offering could be misinterpreted as company officials “believing that there was a shortage of sports cars for rich people.”

But observers say that air of exclusivity, paired with Tesla’s futuristic branding, is exactly its appeal.

Roger Pressman, the founder of EVannex — a Tesla aftermarket accessories company — may be one of the few people outside of Tesla who caught a glimpse of the Model 3’s emerging demographic when he stood in line with several hundred people anxious to put down their deposit for the vehicle last year.

At a glance, Pressman said, Model 3 buyers are between the ages of 25 and 45 and most have never owned an electric vehicle. They’re drawn to Tesla, he said, because of the “sashay” of Musk’s futuristic vision and their desire to drive an environmentally-friendly vehicle.

“People in that age range are very used to using devices, and this car is a device on wheels,” Pressman said. “I do think the demographic will be very similar to the demographic that buys the BMW 3 Series.”

Yes, that sounds a bit supervillain-ish, but Musk is playing the hero role here. He has always been clear that his objective with Tesla is save the planet by speeding humanity's transition to sustainable energy.

In keeping with that theme, here's what Musk wrote in what he called The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me) in 2006:

Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options. Don't tell anyone.

Over the past 11 years, Musk has worked to execute his plan to the letter (except he's hardly kept it secret). You can watch the journey in the video above. Yeah, there have been some mistakes, a near financial meltdown, and several production setbacks. But Tesla built and sold 2,400 sporty two-seater Roadsters. It used that money to help fund the development of the slightly cheaper Model S and Model X. Along the way, Tesla acquired Solar City and added home batteries and solar roofs to the mix.

Now, with the levels of anticipation usually reserved for an iPhone launch, the first ""affordable"" Model 3 cars are being delivered this week. Tesla plans to build and sell 500,000 cars next year, using all the lessons it has learned along the way.

Meanwhile, Musk has already published his Master Plan Part Deux, which calls for pickups, semi-trucks, and fully autonomous driving. His plan for world domination—sorry, world salvation—is only just getting started."

There's another thing that Elon Musk's electric-car company represents to experts who study innovative businesses and breakthrough technology: an approach to manufacturing, called an S-curve.

Last week during a glitzy launch event, Musk unveiled a warning alongside the first 30 production cars of the new Model 3. ""The major challenge for us over the six to nine months is how do we build a huge number of cars,"" the Tesla founder and CEO said.

His next words quickly became famous: ""Frankly, we're going to be in production hell. ""

But the S-curve that underpins the Model S production ramp isn't known to most people. Last week Tesla tweeted a visual explanation:

An S-curve like the one Musk has invoked compares what a company gets against the amount of effort or money spent to achieve it. Melissa Schilling, professor of management and organizations at NYU's Stern School of Business, said the curve starts low and slow because ""at first you don't know what the hell you're doing."" Companies experiment with designs, manufacturing methods, cope with failures and learn what works and what doesn't. ""You're pumping a lot of money in, and you're getting very little return,"" Schilling said.

As processes and technologies improve and become standardized, performance improves relative to every dollar spent. This is where the dramatic breakthroughs happen — cellphones became incredibly light and small once batteries shrank in size and increased in power."

However, Tesla Motors reported in its second quarterly update of 2017 today that its Model S and Model X, er, models have also seen an uptick in orders.

The brand's new entry point Model 3 has seen a reported average of ""over 1,800 Model 3 net reservations per day"" since last week's hand-off event where 30 production cars were delivered to Tesla employees. Presumably that's the difference between new reservations resulting from all of the buzz and cancellations as prospective buyers learn that deliveries to customers won't start until later this year, with current wait times stretching well into 2018. Still, with numbers like those, it appears that a significant number of buyers feel the Model 3 will be worth the wait.

Tesla

Perhaps what's most surprising is the reported uptick in orders for the Model S sedan and Model X SUV orders. Tesla's report states that leading up to and beyond the Model 3 launch event, ""weekly net order rate for these vehicles was about 15 percent higher"" than average with deliveries up 53 percent relative to the same quarter last year.

Model S and X are still important to the brand, even in the wake of the Model 3 launch. In fact, during the Q1 2017 earnings call just a few months ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that prospective buyers delaying purchases because they incorrectly think that the 3 is an upgrade to the S was a primary concern for the brand. The continued growth of S and X sales seems to indicate that Tesla's message is being heard.

Tesla

Looking forward, Tesla's next big challenge is ramping up Model 3 production over the upcoming quarters, which will be critical if it hopes to reach its goal of 500,000 Model 3s built annually and making a dent in its huge log of preorders. The electric automaker states that its ""production ramp will follow an S-curve, meaning that it will begin slowly, grow exponentially, then start to tail off"" as it approaches full production. Current goals state 1,500 cars built over the 3 months of Q3 2017, a ramp up to 5,000 cars per week by year's end and a culmination of 10,000 Model 3s built weekly ""at some point in 2018.""

The Q2 2017 earnings report also went on to reiterate the automaker's next big thing, a fully electric semi-truck, and to tout Tesla's recent successes in solar and battery power endeavors outside of the automotive industry, including the recent news that it had been selected to build the 'world's biggest' lithium-ion battery in Australia."
https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/225853-tesla-unveils-its-long-awaited-35k-model-3-electric-car,pos,0.9999999038163698,9.618356055300138e-08,Tesla Motors unveils its long-awaited $35K Model 3 electric car,2016-04-01 07:06:16,2019-06-24 14:39:20.935519,Jamie Lendino,"After almost a decade of teases, promises, and back-of-the-envelope calculations from journalists and fans the world afar, Tesla Motors has finally unveiled the Model 3, a $35,000 product that aims to bring high-end electric cars to the masses. We’ve had lower-priced EVs before, including the Nissan Leaf, the dowdy Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and the sort-of-kind-of Chevy Volt. What makes the Model 3 special is the Tesla pedigree–which should mean BMW 3 Series-like performance, and certainly does mean striking styling, as is evidenced by the final reveal.

The base model car seats five comfortably, and should be good for 0-60 in less than six seconds, CEO Elon Musk says: “At Tesla, we don’t make slow cars. And of course, there will be versions that go much faster.” The base model will have a 215-mile range. That puts it within spitting distance of a 328i with the turbo four, and while a gas tank will still offer more range and faster fill-ups, 215 miles puts the Model 3 at more than double what you’ll get out of any non-Tesla EV on a single charge. The glass roof extends from the base of the windshield all the way back to the trunk lid. The overall look emphasizes the wheelbase, with the four wheels pushed out to near the edges and what promises to be a roomier-than-usual interior.

Musk promised the car will achieve 5-star safety ratings “in every category,” and will include an array of standard (not optional) Autopilot-style safety features. “We really believe safety has to come first,” Musk said. The Model 3 will support supercharging at Tesla stations for longer-distance trips. Musk emphasized the electric car’s green credentials, noting that we have record high CO2 levels, and that we passed 403.5 PPM as of March 2016 — matching what the Earth last saw 11 million years ago.

The interior features a landscape capacitive touch screen, instead of the portrait 17-inch display the Model S has. No other specs have been unveiled just yet, but this car looks like it will land squarely in compact (180-inch-long) territory, putting it right at Mazda 3, BMW 3 Series, and Honda Civic size (within a couple of inches in either direction). It’s tough to make a smaller car look long, low, and sleek because of the need for appropriate passenger headroom and safety requirements, but Tesla may well have pulled it off. We can also easily imagine a Ludicrous Mode version of the Model 3 as a proper BMW M3 and Audi S4 fighter.

Pre-orders begin now; over 115,000 people have already ponied up a refundable $1,000 deposit. Deliveries are expected to begin at the end of 2017. Tesla’s not known for making its deadlines, but it is certainly known for delivering a top-notch product. Musk says he wants Tesla outputting 500,000 cars per year, thanks to its existing Fremont Factory, with the majority of them Model 3s–and “we basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium ion production,” hence the planned Gigafactory we’ve covered before.

Tesla is promising that to meet the charging demands, there will be 7,200 superchargers and 15,000 destination chargers available by the end of 2017 in time for the release of the vehicle. Today there are 215 Tesla stores in the U.S.; Musk says there will be 441 by the end of 2017 as well.

On the one hand, it’s easy to imagine this car doing well, assuming it achieves all that Musk promises; on the other, the reveal is comes amid a huge glut in oil production and fuel prices near 15-year lows across the U.S. Car buyers typically vote with their wallets. Right now hybrid sales aren’t exactly soaring, VW may have set the passenger diesel car market aflame (if not the SUV and pickup side) with its cheating, and some are already complaining about the taxpayer subsidies for electric cars.

But all signs are that the future of EVs is bright, and it’s hard to argue with Tesla’s clout and brand identity. The average sale price of a car in the U.S. is $33,560 as of 2015. Competing BMWs and Audis may start in the 30s, but are usually stuffed with $15K to $20K worth of options on dealer lots, including ridiculously overpriced features like Bluetooth and backup cameras that are standard on much less expensive vehicles. Between EV tax breaks and Musks’s promise that the Model 3 will be both available and compelling at its base price, the Model 3 could be the first electric car to see mainstream-level sales.

Watch the full unveil below. The actual car appears at the 18-minute mark. And yes, we’re excited; it’s going to be a long 18 months."

If you missed the event, you can watch it above. But for a quick rundown of the key highlights, here are the top seven features of the Model 3.

It has a range of 215 miles.

That's slightly less than the shortest-range Model S, which starts at 240 miles. But Musk said those are just ""minimum"" expectations. ""We hope to exceed them,"" he said. Musk didn't elaborate on the battery technology within the Model 3, but for reference, the 240-mile-range Model S runs on a 70 kWh battery.

The dashboard doesn't look like what you're used to.

Gone are the familiar dials and buttons of a traditional car. The Model 3 clears all that away for a clean, futuristic dash, with the main user interface being a simple steering wheel and a tablet mounted where you would ordinarily see radio knobs and climate controls.

The rear windshield and roof are made out of a single sheet of glass.

Just as the Model X's front windshield sweeps up and over the occupants' heads, so does the rear windshield on the Model 3. The result, said Musk, is some ""amazing headroom and a feeling of openness"" for passengers in the back seat.

Tesla moved the front seats further up.

To create even more leg room for people in the rear seat, Tesla designed the Model 3 so that the driver and front passenger will sit closer to the front of the car. It's unclear whether this creates a meaningful difference in driving experience, but this small change will likely mean big benefits for those in the back.

The car doesn't skimp on cargo space, according to Musk.

Autopilot hardware comes standard.

Every car will come with the hardware needed to enable Autopilot, and all of Autopilot's key safety features will be built in. But it'll still cost you extra to add Autopilot's signature feature: The ability to cruise down the highway with the computer in control.

@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X). — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 1, 2016

It's fast.

The Model 3 can go from zero to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds, Musk said. This number reflects the base performance, he added. Buy a fancier Model 3 and you might be able to shave a few seconds off that time, he hinted."

In a Friday note, Evercore ISI said investors surveyed Thursday predicted that Model 3 orders would total 55,000 in 72 hours. By the end of the year, they expected orders to hit 117,000 cars.



Evercore analysts said in the report they had thought the survey results were ""overly optimistic.""



""How wrong could we have been?"" the report said.



Traditionally, mass market auto customers have wanted to see vehicles for themselves, take a test drive and read reviews before putting down a deposit – none of which happened Thursday with Tesla, according to the report.



""It seems that Tesla's brand equity has enabled it to break all convention with consumers happy to place a 'blind' order,"" the report said."

With Tesla struggling to overcome what CEO Elon Musk has described as ""production hell"" on its lower-priced Model 3 sedan — a meager 260 were built in the third quarter versus more 1,500 predicted — it's easy to think that Tesla is all about this car and only this car.

But even as Tesla works through its Model 3 bottlenecks, it's on track to max out its manufacturing capacity for the Model 3's stablemates, the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV, both high-priced luxury cars. The company could produce more than 100,000 in 2017, setting a record and sending a signal that no matter how long it takes to ramp up the Model 3, Tesla's car business isn't going to vanish.

This gives us the opportunity to look back at Tesla overall strategy for launching vehicles. Unlike the crop of electric-car startups that appeared around the same time Tesla did — and later faltered, leaving Tesla as the only game in town — and unlike major automakers that propose exotic concept EVs but never get around to actually marketing them, Tesla has long relied on a multi-vehicle plan.

You can't do it with one car

The Model S. Tesla

As it stands, Tesla is a four-car company. That doesn't sound like much, but it has almost single-handedly validated a global market for electric cars. Before Tesla's ascent, the idea of a one-car EV maker would have been laughable. One of the cars, the original Roadster, has been discontinued, but eventually Tesla will make good on promises to introduce an updated version, and in any case, the company continues to take care of Roadster owners.

Then there are the Models S, X, and 3. And it's worth noting that not only does the lineup represent a strategy for developing a meaningful EV market — the cars also look terrific. That's thanks to Tesla's design chief, Franz von Holzhausen, who, when he was hired away from Mazda back in 2010, was tasked with ""building a world-class design competency at Tesla Motors,"" according to the company.

Working with CEO Elon Musk, Tesla product architect and the guy with the multi-vehicle idea, Holzhausen has expressed the strategy in physical terms. If you look at Tesla's post-Roadster vehicles, they are aesthetically unified and self-reinforcing. The cars aren't especially flashy, but they do collectively express a Tesla look that's unmistakable.

This is strategy given beautiful physical form, undergirded by Holzhausen's obvious belief that less is more. Tesla's luxury cars aren't larded with luxury clues — the chrome isn't laid on with a trowel, the curves and lines are smooth and sleek but not dramatic, and the interiors are subdued.

The Model 3 translates these values into a smaller, less expensive package, proving that it can be translated. Effectively, this ups the ""Tesla luxury"" aspect of the new vehicle and bolsters its Silicon Valley approach to design, which is informed by technology rather than by fealty to the automaking tradition.

An inverted wow!

The Model X. Tesla

Most luxury cars and well-designed mass-market vehicles aspire to be handsome, stately, and low-key impressive. The wow! factor is reserved for sports cars and supercars and some big trucks. But Tesla has devised its own inverted wow! factor. Whenever I get to borrow and drive one, I get lots of looks, lots of thumbs-up, lots of questions. This can't entirely be chalked up to novelty; the Model S has been around since 2012, the Model X since 2015.

Rather, Tesla's aesthetics embody the company's futuristic attitude and the carmaker's embrace of a technological adventure, and people respond to that in a more emotional way that you might expect. They don't drop their jaws as they would if a Ferrari or Lamborghini rolled by. Instead, they nurture of feeling of respect for Tesla's nerdy ambition to change the world, but to do it without making their cars look like dreary virtue-mobiles.

This reaction has been key to Tesla's success, which has far exceeded anything the auto industry anticipated. Tesla has created a club of intensely brand-loyal owners. The aura of that club was instrumental in the unprecedented reveal of the Model 3 in early 2016, after which hundred of thousands of preorders for the vehicle were logged. People wanted to do more than bask in the beauty; they wanted to own it. And they were willing to lay down $1,000 each for the right to take delivery of their car years later.

None of this would have happened if Tesla's hadn't made the design of its cars just as important as their invisible battery-electric engineering that made then go. It's an incredible achievement that proves the oldest of adages in the industry: If you want them to buy, you have to show them the car.

Tesla didn't just show the car; it made the showing matter in a new way."

But if a deal with India didn't seem like it was among the top items on Musk's mind, that's because many have missed a budding ""Twitter EV bromance"" between the Tesla founder and CEO and Indian auto executives and government officials. On June 2, Anand Mahindra, the head of India's leading automaker Mahindra and Mahindra, invited Musk to come to India and be part of the country's budding electric-vehicles market. Musk's response was short, noncommittal and guarded: Unlike China, the other big emerging market, Musk has been blowing hot and cold for some time now on the question of Tesla's foray into the Indian market. In February one of Tesla's Indian fans took to Twitter to ask about the automaker's plans for the India launch. Musk responded with a tease of summer plans. But later in May, when another fan posed a similar question on Twitter, Musk backtracked, citing regulatory hurdles around local sourcing requirements.

On the face of it, Tesla and India seem to be an ideal fit for each other. Both are committed to the cause of renewable energy and green mobility. Tesla is a sustainable energy company that is pushing for a world of zero-emission vehicles, and India is on course to become the world's third-largest auto market, tied to an ambitious vision to do away with fossil-fuel cars in favor of all-electric cars by 2030.

Despite the seemingly aligned interests, there are reasons underlying the Tesla founder and CEO's less-than-gung-ho tweets. Tesla and India aren't ready for each other just yet. It could take years for Tesla to debut in India.

Here comes the sticker shock

India is a highly price-sensitive market, which is a fact known globally. From to Uber and , many foreign companies have had to launch low-price versions of their products in a bid to make inroads in the Indian market. Tesla's Model X, priced at roughly $90,000, and the Model S, carrying a $70,000 price estimate, are far out of the average Indian car buyer's budget. It would be hard for Tesla to achieve mass-market volume in India necessary for a venture to make good business sense for the luxury car maker. ""About 85 percent of the market is filled with value-conscious customers, [which] has the largest potential for growth,"" said Chetan Maini, the creator of Reva, India's first electric car. ""Successful solutions designed so far have considered the price points they are willing to afford. Foreign or local electric cars (EVs) will grow in India only when there's price parity with its internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalent."" Even Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan — which starts at $35,000 and considered an affordable option in the United States — at 2.2 million rupees it is still a high-end luxury product by Indian standards, affordable only to a wafer-thin segment of India's car enthusiasts. ""India's mobility paradigm has very different characteristics as compared to that of Western counterparts,"" Maini said. He is also the vice chairman of SUN Mobility, a company that makes replaceable batteries for electric cars. ""In the past, solutions tailored for the local conditions have worked well."" Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in a recent report that there's huge uncertainty as to whether Tesla will succeed in making great product at an affordable price. ""There is evidence suggesting that Tesla will succeed, but if not, Tesla will remain an automaker for the wealthy,"" he wrote. Emails sent to Tesla inquiring about the company's India plans went unanswered.

Lagging infrastructure

Adoption and expansion of electric vehicles in India will require an ecosystem to support their practicality, frugality and clean-energy objectives. India's ambitious goals for green mobility — roads, charging stations, power storage, service centers and suppliers — contrast with the nation's inadequate infrastructure. ""The key challenges to adoption of EVs in India are low penetration of charging infrastructure,"" said Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric, the electric vehicle division of Mahindra and Mahindra. ""Given these conditions, it is understandable that local as well as foreign players may hesitate to expand in the Indian market."" Several stakeholders have started discussions on developing an extensive EV ecosystem in India, but it may be a few years before a reliable infrastructure is in place. Babu said public-private partnerships are one way to speed things up. ""Such partnerships will help in developing the market, both in terms of infrastructure as well as education and awareness,"" he said. Sugato Sen, deputy director general at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said an investment by Tesla in India could help boost EV infrastructure and adoption. ""If we have companies like Tesla in the country, the infrastructure for charging vehicles and suppliers for EV components will come up faster,"" he said. Tesla has invested billions in the U.S., China and Japan to set up networks of charging stations, and continues to pour capital into their expansion. Tesla won't reveal if it has similar plans for India.

India's pivot to green energy has paved the way for local companies to rush in with their EV offerings. Mahindra Electric is leading the charge with its homegrown, battery-operated e2o Plus, a $10,000 car that goes about 87 miles per charge. By comparison, Tesla's most affordable $35,000 Model 3 claims a range of 214 miles per charge. Mahindra makes up in affordability what it lacks in mileage, which it's trying to ramp up. Local automakers are quick to point out the significant home-field advantage they enjoy relative to foreign carmakers. ""We have the unique position of having years of experience of the Indian market as well as over 265 million kms (164 million miles) driven on our EVs,"" Babu said. ""This does put us at a certain advantage, and we have used these insights to develop our current and future products."" Maini said local players' in-depth understanding of local conditions creates advantages but ultimately can be co-opted. ""Any foreign company can create a great business opportunity by understanding the local consumer behavior and market characteristics, and design a solution suitable for that country,"" he said. A production plant in India may be a worthwhile investment for Tesla. ""Tesla's mission is to make EVs increasingly more affordable, which means more assembly plants must come online to achieve annual unit delivery volume in the millions,"" Morningstar analyst Whiston wrote. Musk did say at the recent Tesla annual shareholder meeting that he would like to build a new plant for the Model Y crossover vehicle. Though no details were given, the assumption for that is a U.S.-based facility. Musk has also said he plans to build multiple electric-battery gigafactories beyond the first gigafactory in Nevada.

Tesla Motors said Monday that it would begin requiring certain Tesla owners to pay to charge their electric vehicles at the company's network of charging stations.

In a reversal, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker said its superchargers would no longer be completely free. The charges apply to people who buy a Tesla vehicle after Jan. 1, 2017. They will be charged a fee to use the charging stations after about 1,000 miles of free usage annually.

The automaker did not reveal pricing, calling it ""a small fee"" that would be ""charged incrementally and cost less than the price of filling up a comparable gas car.""

""We will release the details of the program later this year, and while prices may fluctuate over time and vary regionally based on the cost of electricity, our Supercharger Network will never be a profit center,"" the company said in a statement.

The company has installed more than 4,600 charging stations throughout the world, giving Tesla owners free access to electricity. CEO Elon Musk long trumpeted the superchargers as an enticing reason to own a Tesla vehicle.

Anyone who already owns a Tesla or buys one by Jan. 1 and takes delivery by April 1 is grandfathered into the free model.

Owners can still charge their vehicles at home, where they must pay standard power rates.

After a rally that ended in April, Tesla’s market capitalization is currently about $31 billion - equivalent to $620,000 for every car it delivered last year, or $63,000 for every car it hopes to produce in 2020.

By comparison, General Motors Co’s (GM.N) $48 billion market value is equivalent to about $4,800 for every vehicle it sold last year.

Tesla’s heady valuation - about 125 times the next 12 months of expected earnings - and the implication that shareholders may be overpaying for Musk’s small but fast-growing luxury car company have made the stock a favorite of short sellers.

Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a cheaper price.

Tesla is among the world’s 10 most-shorted companies by market value, even after an 85 percent rally earlier this year scalded some of those short sellers. In the past month, short bets against Tesla fell by over $1 billion, but are still above $6 billion, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

“This is not just day traders coming in and out of the market. This is fundamental guys who have put it in their portfolio and are saying, ‘We don’t believe this valuation is correct,’” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s head of research.

Vilas Capital Management Chief Executive John Thompson, one of those short sellers, said he believes investors underestimate the hurdles Tesla faces trying to rapidly increase production, including the cost to build future high-end robotic assembly lines.

“They’re going to have to spend an enormous amount of money on capital expenditures to achieve their long-term goals and they don’t have the money because they don’t have the earnings,” Thompson said. “So they’re going to have to sell stock to finance it.”

Musk has promised to turn Tesla’s first net profit by the fourth quarter. After selling 52,000 cars last year, Tesla aims to sell 500,000 annually by 2020.

But its stock price suggests investors expect even more aggressive growth.

If Tesla shares were to grow 10 percent a year for the next 10 years - not unreasonable for a popular growth company - it would have to reach annual sales of 1.5 million cars at triple GM’s typical $1,000-per-car profit to justify a more moderate price-earnings ratio of 20. Last year GM sold 10 million cars and Ford sold 6.6 million.

Tesla could make money in the future selling batteries or autonomous vehicles, but its valuation is questionable nonetheless and leaves no allowance for operational setbacks, said Georgetown University business professor James Angel.

“This stock is definitely priced to perfection. If he pulls everything off, it’s probably worth its current value, but there’s a huge amount of execution risk here,” Angel said.

Recent problems like malfunctioning doors and glitchy sensors have cast light on the difficulty of quickly expanding production as Tesla prepares to launch its Model 3 sedan next year.

When it reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, analysts will watch to see whether it is on track to deliver positive cash flow for 2016 and become profitable."

You have to hand it to Elon Musk. He didn't just sell the deal of his life last week when shareholders of Tesla and SolarCity agreed to a merger. He pulled off the deal amid widespread criticism from business ethics and corporate governance experts who slammed Musk from the moment the $2.6 billion deal was proposed. Any skepticism Musk deserves he created for himself, but that skepticism now needs to move from the deal to something else: Just what exactly have Tesla investors gotten themselves into? Some pundits point to the deal as part of Musk's master plan to create a car powered by solar and to develop batteries that radically change how we generate and store energy. Musk noted earlier this month that a solar roof for cars is ""probably"" going to be added as an option for Tesla buyers.

But a good place to look at the lingering confusion as the combined electric-car and solar-power company moves forward is the reaction from stock analysts. Musk's vision is so bold that some on Wall Street remain unable to fully comprehend it or, in the least, grasp how it's a catalyst for Tesla shares in the short term. ""Whatever the synergies are down the road, it's negative for current holders,'' said Efraim Levy, analyst at CFRA Research.

Tesla, a longtime money loser whose shares are set to have their first down year since its 2010 initial public offering, is set to take off with the launch next year of its Model 3 sedan. But instead of riding the inflection point into profitability, Musk is doubling down by having Tesla take on SolarCity, which he owns 22 percent of and which lost $758.7 million in the first nine months of 2016. Skeptics like Levy argue that SolarCity brings too much new risk to Tesla, a company that burned nearly $2.2 billion of cash last year as it geared up to launch the mid-priced Model 3 sedan and open its $5 billion Gigafactory to make batteries. Levy rates Tesla shares a hold with a $205 price target, but argues the SolarCity deal dilutes Tesla's near-term earnings so much that it's hard to support. More from Tech Drivers:

Uber for orchestras Musk says the deal will boost his longer-term vision of a diversified renewable-energy company whose products can generate electricity, store it and use it to power both homes and cars without using fossil fuels.

""To solve the sustainable-energy question, we need sustainable-energy production, which is going to come primarily in the form of solar. ... Combine that with stationary storage and an electric vehicle and you have a complete solution to a sustainable-energy future,"" he said in June. ""Those are three parts that are needed. And those are three things that I think Tesla should be providing.""

'This is going to be a tough one for the sell side.'

To analysts, though, that forward-looking vision leapfrogs a basic difficulty in understanding the combined entity today. ""This is going to be a tough one for the sell side,"" said Theodore O'Neill, who follows Tesla for Ascendiant Capital Markets. ""I'm an industrials and auto analyst who doesn't really know the solar market. It's [also] going to be an issue for the SCTY analysts who don't know the auto side of the business."" O'Neill did spend some time earlier in his career following solar companies. Levy alluded to another difference between how investors should view the future and how far off Musk looks into it: The Tesla Motors CEO has a checkered track record of delivering on short-term promises. The opposition the deal faced is in part a function of the diminished trust flowing from missed earnings targets and production delays on the Model X crossover, and skepticism that the company will be able to get the Model 3 to market at full scale before 2018.

""There are often a lot of promises without delivery, at least on time,"" Levy said. Levy hasn't published a 2017 earnings forecast for the combined company yet. Without the deal, Tesla's car and battery business would be poised to deliver on many of its promises, earning as much as $4.60 a share by 2018, a little more than 40 times the current stock price.



The ranks of stock analysts doesn't lack for Tesla bulls. James Albertine of Consumer Edge Research said that while SolarCity loses money, Tesla could sell cars at an annual clip that will accelerate quickly once the Model 3 kicks in. Albertine continues to recommend Tesla shares and thinks they could hit $260 in the next year, but even he concedes the deal has clouded the picture, and it's a picture that had been rapidly coming into focus for Tesla. Now it's a ""20- to 30-year vision"" that's harder to evaluate, he said. And since the total picture of solar-focused businesses will take years to develop, there's a good argument that Musk is paying too much for SolarCity today, before it's able to make that vision happen, he said. Even before taking on money losing SolarCity, the market was concerned about cash drains at independent Tesla as it worked on the Model 3 and the Gigafactory. Tesla's spent $1.5 billion on capital expenditures in the last five quarters, while its cash position hovered at $3.1 billion. But the cash drain has slowed as those projects near completion, Albertine said. ""You can tick them off the list,"" he said. ""They're further along and in a better cash-flow generating position than people think."" With 400,000 Model 3 reservations in hand, compared with 17,350 cars and trucks it has sold in the United States this year, Tesla could be building cars at a 500,000-per-year clip by the end of 2018, Albertine estimated. ""It will lead many to recognize that the short sellers were wrong, "" he said."

Thomson Reuters The Teslarati are worried.

After a decade of the company and its CEO, Elon Musk, riding a wave of enthusiasm about electric vehicles and the remaking of transportation, the election of Donald Trump as President and complete Republican takeover of Congress, the worry is that EV-friendly policies are on the way out and that Tesla will lose federal support for its business.

That business will now include solar products and services, after Tesla shareholders voted last week to merge with SolarCity.

Solar in the US has also been heavily reliant on federal backing during the Obama administration.

Tesla and Musk have their detractors, many of who accuse the CEO of living off the government's dime — something that Musk himself wouldn't entirely deny, throwing in his third company, SpaceX, for good measure. SpaceX's biggest customer is NASA, and Tesla depended on a Department of Energy loan guarantee to get through its crisis in 2008-09. Electric vehicles, he would argue, make up only about 1% of global auto sales. So Tesla, as well as any other electric carmaker, including the big car companies, need all the help from governments they can get.

Tesla shares are already down over 20% year to date, so the ""Trump phenomenon"" and whatever impact it has on green businesses is an unwelcome shock to Tesla's system. At best, it makes investors nervous. At worst, it sends them scurrying for the exists.

The crux of the problem

But here's the problem: As much as some Republicans might not like environmentalism or the leadership on climate-change action that Musk has provided, Tesla, SolarCity and SpaceX are three of the best examples of what Republicans and Trump are always talking about unleashing to restore the US economy to what they insist is vanished glory.

In just over ten years, Tesla has created a $30-billion market-cap company. SolarCity's pre-merger market cap is $2 billion. SpaceX has been valued at something like $12 billion, pre-IPO.

That's roughly $45-billion worth of business, with nearly all of it maintaining operations and employing people in the US. How many people? Tesla has 14,000 workers, SpaceX has 5,000, and SolarCity has 13,000. These are not all high-income, high-tech, education-intensive jobs, either, as might be the case with a Silicon Valley software startup. Tesla operates a car factory (which in turns supports parts suppliers), while SolarCity needs panel-installers and service personnel. Musk's companies are spreading the wealth around the income distribution.

A model of risk-taking

Collectively, this is a story of risk-taking entrepreneurship that's paid off. Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX weren't exactly small businesses when they started out, but they were businesses that were pitting themselves against strong odds.

Tesla is the first successful new car company to be created in the US in decades, and SpaceX is the first viable private space-exploration business to not just largely achieve its objectives, but to chart ambitious new ones, including a mission to Mars.

In fact, it would be difficult to find companies that pro-business Republicans could praise more effusively than these three, simply on the fundamentals of what creating and growing companies in America is all about. Democrats and Independents can do the same.

Discomfort with Musk's larger vision of accelerating humanity's exit from the fossil-fuel era might color views of his companies from the right, but if a businessman wants to create tens of billions of value, essentially out of nothing, and save the planet at the same time, then why take a position against it?

At a level, business is business, and although it's unclear whether SpaceX will ever make it to Mars or whether SolarCity will put a solar roof on every house in the US, there's no denying that almost 400,000 people want to own a Tesla Model 3, based on the number of $1,000-a-pop in preorders the automaker has racked up.

The future is still being written

What a solar roof would look like. Tesla

Let's be clear: we have no idea what type of stance a Trump administration or GOP-controlled Congress would take toward Musk's enterprises. The worry is being driven by the assumption that a big theme in government is set to change: that support for companies that are working toward sustainability will be withdrawn.

It's important to note, however, that withdrawing that support, in the face of wildly successful businesses, wouldn't make much sense. There are also arguments that it would leave opportunities on the table — opportunities that global competitors would be happy to snap up, which in turn would undermine job growth in the US.

But the nuts and bolts matter less in this case than the legitimate concern that ideology will triumph over reality. Politicians who turn against Tesla — or SolarCity or SpaceX — would be discouraging something that's become a core American value: those who take the mightiest risks will gather the greatest rewards.

Musk and his companies have proven themselves, surviving brushes with bankruptcy and rockets exploding on launch pads to become powerful examples of why daring entrepreneurship and aiming very, very high to solve the biggest problems truly make America great. Now Washington needs to live up that example."

Mcquillan + Ivan Eland + Richard K. Vedder + Stephen P. Halbrook + David T. Beito + Linda Royster Beito + Robert M. Whaples + Bradley M. Gardner + William J. Watkins + Christopher J. Coyne,"During a January 19th panel discussion at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Tesla Motors general counsel Todd Maron said: “We make money from one thing: car sales and car sales alone.” In reality, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Motors loses more than $4,000 on every car it sells on a “full-cost” basis (keep in mind that some of Tesla’s costs are heavily subsidized). Tesla’s losses per vehicle are even greater using generally accepted accounting principles. CNBC and Reuters explained:

Tesla reports its finances in a different way from the Detroit automakers. Using the generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, used by GM or Ford, Tesla’s operating losses per vehicle have steadily widened to $14,758 from $3,794 in the second quarter of 2014.

Tesla, instead, largely survives on government handouts.

In 2015, Tesla delivered 50,580 cars worldwide, with 25,700 going to U.S. customers. This is a trivial percentage of both the worldwide and U.S. auto markets. A record 17.5 million passenger vehicles were bought in the United States in 2015. Yet only 0.67 percent—or 116,548 vehicles—were all-electrics or plug-in hybrids, 6,500 fewer than in 2014. EVs account for 0.16 percent of the 250 million U.S. passenger vehicles on the road. The market for electric cars is trivial, despite massive government support.

Instead of making money from car sales, Tesla survives by participating in many government subsidy programs. One lucrative program is California’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credit program. Phil Kerpen explained how the program works:

ZEV credits are a mandate dreamed up by the bureaucrats at the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which requires [auto] manufacturers to build and dealers to sell an arbitrary number of “zero-emission” vehicles each year. . . . Tesla’s Model S generates four credits per unit sold. This means the company can sell $20,000 in ZEV credits to other [auto] manufacturers for each Model S sold—a cost borne by purchasers of other cars.

ZEV credits, pioneered in California, have spread to nine other states. Tesla has collected more than $517 million from competing automakers by selling ZEV credits to those who fail to sell enough zero-emissions cars to meet arbitrary mandates.

Charles Lane of the Washington Post said: “Tesla owes its survival to subsidies from taxpayers, who are usually less well-heeled than its plutocratic customers.” The average household income of Tesla owners is $320,000, according to Strategic Visions, a consumer research company.

Tesla buyers have also raked in $38 million in California government rebates (they receive a $2,500 rebate for each Tesla bought) and $284 million in federal tax incentives (they receive a $7,500 federal tax credit for each purchased Tesla).

The Los Angeles Times calculated that Elon Musk’s three companies, Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and SpaceX, combined have received a staggering $4.9 billion in government support over the past decade. As Kerpen noted: “Every time a Tesla is sold . . . average Americans are on the hook for at least $30,000 in federal and state subsidies” that go to wealthy Tesla owners. This is crony capitalism at its worst.

Tesla is in the business of capturing government subsidies, not making cars that people actually buy. At the same FTC panel, Tesla’s Maron said: “It’s imperative [that gas powered cars] are replaced entirely by electric vehicles.” What’s the plan for achieving this? Buried in its 2013 annual report Tesla admitted: “Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives.”

Hold onto your wallets everyone, Tesla wants to grow.

P.S. Looks like my blog will prevent me from ever owning a Tesla. See this from SFGate: “Elon Musk Personally Cancels ‘Super Rude’ Customer’s Tesla Model X Order—Don’t Cross the Bel Air Billionaire. He Has the Power to Ban You.” So petty. Hopefully Musk will never own a life-saving drug company."

Thomson Reuters These are weird, borderline surreal times for Tesla.

America hasn't seen a new a major new car company since Chrysler in the 1920s, and in just over a decade, Tesla has gone from being a crazy Silicon Valley dream to a viable automaker that will deliver close to 100,000 vehicles by the end of this year.

But Tesla is enduring some serious growing pains, is being ruthlessly reassessed in terms of its future growth potential by Wall Street, and has a CEO in Elon Musk, who could soon be slightly distracted by his desire to colonize Mars within 10 years.

At times like this it's easy to lose sight of a company's core competency. Apple has its ups and down, but it's still great at creating a simple user experience and at designing gorgeous devices. Amazon sells everything, but it's the absolute first stop for millions of book buyers. Google is working on driverless cars and just rolled out an impressive array of new gadgets, but its biggest advantage is that it's still the most powerful way to find stuff online.

Tesla may be starting an energy-storage business and buying SolarCity and building a giant battery factory in Nevada, but at base it's a carmaker. And as carmakers go, it's exceptional.

So good

I've enthused over how great the Model S sedan is. It was Tesla's first ""clean sheet"" design, and almost right out of the box it was brilliant. The Model X SUV had a difficult birth, but my impressions are that it was worth what Musk called the ""hubris"" that went into it.

The Model s. Paul Sakuma/AP

The Model 3 mass-market car is set to arrive in late 2017, and although I've seen only a prototype version, I have no doubt it will be a stunner. (Even the original Tesla Roadster is still pretty impressive, though Tesla is no longer selling it.)

Musk never wanted to simply prove that there was a much larger market for electric vehicles than had previously been thought possible. Other electric-vehicle startups that just wanted to deliver an inexpensive EV option have failed, and the major automakers' efforts at basic electric mobility have succeeded in creating a market that, globally, is only about 1% of vehicle sales.

No, what Musk wanted to do was redefine what an automobile could be. This has come at a price; Teslas sell for about $100,000, on average (the Model 3 will sticker for $35,000, before tax credits). But you do get what you pay for. The Model S is easily one of the most impressive luxury sedans I've ever driven. And the vehicle is, by most accounts, a joy to own. It's fast, has great range, is comfortable, has wonderful cargo capacity for a four-door, and is the most high-tech car on the road, capable of partially self-driving with Autopilot and of frequent updates to its onboard systems that have eliminated the need for Tesla to use model years.

A Model S owner can wake up after a software update and have, in many ways, a new car. The tires and windows and body will of course be the same, but the vehicle will have fresh capabilities.

The Model X advances this paradigm, with its exotic falcon-wing doors, massive front glass, and ""Bioweapon Defense Mode"" air filtration.

Mass brilliance

The Model 3 will bring this philosophy of quality to the masses. Mind you, it's not that traditional automakers want to cheap-out on their more basic vehicles. But they typically don't want to scale down from their best offerings. Otherwise, why would a Chevy buyer ever be tempted to work their way up to a Cadillac?

Tesla's goal, by contrast, is to make each of its vehicles equally compelling. This is obviously going to put pressure on profit margins for the Model 3, but Musk doesn't care. And if Tesla does cut corners with the 3, it will do so in innovative ways. For example, we already have some indications that the carmaker may eliminate the conventional instrument panel.

A lot of brands take a ""good enough"" approach to producing less expensive versions of their high-end stuff. This usually doesn't work in the auto industry, though. Cheap materials in less expensive BMWs or Mercedes cars come off as jarring. Tesla has so far resisted the good-enough urge, so much so that the Model S, Motor Trend's Car of the Year in 2013, broke Consumer Reports' test scale.

The Bolt, above, and the Model 3. Chevrolet; Tesla; Business Insider/ Yu Han

Even lower-cost versions of the Model S are still Model S's; they simply have one less electric motor than the top-line dual-motor vehicles and carry smaller battery packs, making for less range and slower acceleration (which is relative when the fastest Tesla can hit 60 mph in less than three seconds).

No compromise

Tesla also shows no signs of ever compromising on quality. In fact, Musk has become obsessed with ""vertical integration"" — and old industry practice of controlling as many aspects of car making in-house as possible. The entire industry has moved away from this in the past two decades, favoring a ""lean"" or ""just in time"" approach — with numerous parts coming from a carefully managed supply chain.

Pretty soon, this philosophy will be tested, as GM prepares to roll its own mass-market EV, the Chevy Bolt, off assembly lines this month. The Bolt is a decent-looking car, but I won't be offending anyone by saying it's no Tesla. Will the customers go for this different approach? We'll see.

But even if they do, don't expect Tesla to change. There are some things it simply can't do, and building a bad car is one of them."

The changes appear to have been mainly geared toward better differentiating the base version of Model S with the new Model 3 in order for the latter not to cannibalize the sales of the former.

As part of this strategy, Tesla is now about to discontinue the cheapest version of Model S, the 75 kWh battery pack with the rear-wheel-drive powertrain.

Tesla salespeople have started contacting potential buyers and Tesla owners who have expressed interest in upgrading their car to let them know that the powertrain option on the Model S will soon not be available.

The company confirmed to Electrek that discontinuing the option is in the plans by the end of the year – without any firm date for now.

At $69,500, the Model S 75 with a single rear-wheel-drive motor is the cheapest new Tesla vehicle currently available with the Model S 75D with dual motor all-wheel-drive being the second cheapest at $74,500.

Unless the vehicle is being replaced by something else, all Tesla vehicles, Model S or X, will be dual motor all-wheel-drive.

The Model 3 is also expected to have a dual motor option, but CEO Elon Musk said that early production will be dedicated to rear-wheel-drive units in order to streamline production. The base $35,000 Model 3 before incentive will be for the rear-wheel drive version of the car.

The move should help further differentiate Model S and Model 3.

On top of being bigger, quicker, and having more options, the Model S still also has the advantage of having the opportunity to have free unlimited access to Tesla’s Supercharger network if purchased through the referral program by the end of the year.

The Model 3 is expected to be on Tesla’s new pay-per-use model when it comes to Supercharging.

After a slight miss on deliveries during the last quarter, Tesla says that they expect to keep up deliveries of Model S and Model X during the second half of the year despite the arrival of Model 3. Those recent changes appear to be geared toward achieving that.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is talking to shareholders, starting with a history of the company. Soon, shareholders will talk to Musk. Here's how it is going:

5:21 p.m. -- At the beginning, Musk and his fellow Tesla creators didn't know what they were doing. ""Completely clueless"" when it came to figuring out how to make a car, he says. Plus, many wouldn't give a startup the time of day. ""At times, we couldn't get suppliers to call us back."" Musk adds. ""That was the usual response.""

5:23 p.m. -- Musk gives a shout out to a California company called AC Propulsion that pioneered electric cars more than a decade ago.

5:29 p.m. -- ""Electric airplanes. Still dying to do that,"" Musk jokes as he recalls the conversation that originally got him to thinking about electric cars. Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel says he brought up the airplane idea initially with Musk. But both turned their thinking to cars. In 2003 and 2004, everyone was telling them there would be no interest in electric cars. Musk says he got a test ride in AC Propulsion's car and he told them ""you've got to show the world this is real.""

5:32 p.m. -- After being told that AC wouldn't make an electric car just for him, Musk says he asked if he could make one himself. That's what led him to the consortium that would launch Tesla. It was never. ""this is a great way to make money."" Rather, ""When I told my friends about this, they said 'You're crazy.'"" Creating a car company would be dumb enough, but launching an electric car company was considered ""stupidity squared."" Musk put the company's odds of success at 10%. He said he put in lots of his own money -- he made one of his fortunes from PayPal -- because he didn't want to risk his friends' money on the Tesla venture.

5:37 p.m. -- He blasts General Motors for killing its electric car program, which had such devoted fans that they were holding candlelight vigils as their cars, the Saturn EV1, were being crushed.

5:40 p.m. -- Big mistake: Thinking that he could take a Lotus Elise and add an electric powertrain to create the Tesla Roadster. In fact, everything changed. ""In the end, only 6% or 7% of the Tesla roadster"" had anything else in common with another car.

5:48 p.m. -- Musk says he gave early test drives to Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The prototype developed a bug so it only went 10 miles per hour. Musk says he had to reassure them the car goes a lot faster -- and they became investors. The lesson for people creating their own company: Adapt quickly, recognize and correct your mistakes. The sooner that happens, so much the better.

5:54 p.m. -- Musk says he ""was basically the chief designer of the body"" of the original Tesla roadster. And he adds: ""I don't think I'm a good designer."" His inspirations: The Ferrari and Porsche.

5:56 p.m. -- The team got 100 orders after giving test rides of two prototypes, which were barely hanging together, says Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel. Musk says ""huge challenges"" with the roadster including a transmission that ""didn't work."" The problem was eventually solved and Roadster deliveries began in 2008. Though it passed all required safety tests, Musk quips that the car was ""completely unsafe"" and ""broke down all the time."" It required redesign and new suppliers. Straubel says Tesla had to move factories from overseas to California, including the battery pack manufacturer from Thailand. He says a lot of what's special and underappreciated about Tesla is its manufacturing processes. ""How important it is to build the machine that builds the machine,"" is how Musk puts it.

6:15 p.m. -- ""I don't know anyone who likes the current car buying experience,"" Musk says. Tesla vowed to fix that, too, by not having conventional dealers. Most important thing: ""Make sure that when people visit our store, they look forward to coming again.""

6:20 p.m. -- Musk says designing a sexy sports car is relatively easy, but a sedan is hard. That led him to former General Motors and Mazda designer Franz von Holzhausen. ""I realize it was the future,"" von Holzhausen says.

6:25 p.m. -- The design studio was a tent pitched in a corner of the SpaceX rocket factory. Musk told von Holzhausen he wanted the Model S to have seven seats -- a very tough challenge in a sedan.

6:29 p.m. -- In October, 2008, Musk says he met with head of R&D with Daimler in hopes of keeping Tesla alive. He says he was told they were thinking about an electric Smart car. He says he called and told Straubel that they had three months to have a working electric Smart car. At the time, Smart wasn't sold in the U.S. So they sent an engineer to Mexico with $20,000, who came back with one. In a day, they had torn the whole car apart. It was the fastest Smart car ever. ""You could do wheelies in the parking lot,"" Musk says. The Daimler team arrived grumpy, but perked up when they drove the prototype -- and they got a development contract. ""If we hadn't done that, Tesla would have died,"" Musk says. It helped with credibility and Tesla needed the dough. Musk says he was tapped out and was borrowing money from friends at the time. It was early 2009, a time when the auto industry was hitting bottom and Chrysler and GM would be filing for bankruptcy reorganization.

6:35 p.m. -- Tesla was losing money on every Roadster it built before the third quarter of 2009. But the Daimler investment was a turning point. ""We were bailed out -- by Daimler, not the government,"" Musk says. Tesla had received and paid back an Energy Department loan. The loan was received in March, 2010.

6:47 p.m. -- When it came to shopping the initial public offering, Musk says he found out Tesla could be polarizing. ""Tesla is a company that seems to inspire love or hate,"" he says. Investors were ""rarely indifferent."" After the IPO, Musk says Tesla became one of the most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq -- right up there with Skullcandy, Coinstar and Travelzoo. He hailed Toyota for joining with Tesla on the RAV4 electric and parting with its Fremont, Calif., factory that it operated jointly with GM. Today, it is Tesla's factory.

6:55 p.m. -- How Tesla created its Supercharger network, its high-speed chargers. Musk says it had been hoping another company would step up and install a network of high-speed electric-car chargers, but none did. Tesla was sending out teams of interns to scout locations at travel rest stops.

7:01 p.m. -- The Gigafactory came about when Musk and his team realized there just wasn't enough industry capacity to make the batteries that Tesla will need. Plus, most lithium-ion battery factories were aimed at supplying the electronics industry, not tailored to electric-car production. He says the Gigafactory will be capable of triple of the volume of what was expected. The party to celebrate its opening will come in July.

7:15 p.m.-- The Model X crossover has been ""challenging,"" Musk says. ""I need to fault myself for hubris in putting too much technology all at once into a product,"" he says. He says he should have saved some of its most cool features for a version II or version III. The big problem at the moment: Making its signature feature, the gullwing doors over the second row, work correctly. ""It's a software problem. It's figuring out how to interpret all the data from the sensors"" and writing in the software in a way that knows how to open the doors under different circumstances. ""Digging ourselves out of the hole"" on that has been quite hard, he says. Two more software releases, which are usually sent wireless to the vehicles, are expected in the next month. ""We will be at point where the doors are better than normal doors, as opposed to worse."" He added that anyone considering a Model X purchase should go ahead. ""If you buy one now or soon, you will love the doors because the software will be right.""

7:23 p.m. -- Musk says Nevada has put in $20 million so far for the battery Gigafactory, compared to $2 billion in investment so far by Tesla and its partners. ""They are giving away nothing. It was basically bushes and desert,"" he says. ""It's basically a 1% discount.""

7:39 p.m. -- Musk closes the more than two hour history of Tesla by talking about how the real improvements in the future will come at the manufacturing level. ""The true problem and difficulty is building the machine that makes the machine,"" he says.

7:46 p.m. -- A Nevada union representative criticizes Tesla for labor practices in building the Gigafactory. Musk says if Tesla had wanted to save money, it never would have built cars in California. And he noted other automakers not only build cars in states with cheaper labor costs, but other countries.

7:51 p.m. -- Musk says Superchargers won't be free for Model 3, its mass-market electric car next year, unless people buy an optional package that includes it. He says people should charge their cars where they charge their phones -- not at a gas station. They need to value their time.

7:54 p.m. -- Musk won't rule out the possibility that someday Tesla made find a way to make electric aircraft, but not now. For one, he says he wants the company to stay focused. For the other, the energy density of batteries isn't where it needs to be yet.

8:08 p.m. -- Musk says no worries about the supply of lithum, used in Tesla batteries. ""The nice thing about lithium is it's extremely abundant on earth,"" he says. In the next few years, Straubel says that Tesla is trying to find ways to reduce costs of lithium, but there have been no problems with supply.

8:18 p.m. -- Eventually, Musk says he expects Tesla's battery storage business, Tesla Energy, to have ""roughly similar"" revenue as the vehicle side.

8:40 p.m. -- Musk says he's already overdue to a board of directors meeting in closing the session.

At the time, Tesla bristled at the BBC's insinuations. But in a somewhat rambling keynote during a Tesla shareholder's meeting yesterday, CEO Elon Musk basically admitted that the Roadster project was a complete debacle.

Fortune's Katie Fehrenbacher took detailed notes of Musk's lengthy retelling of the Tesla origin story, including his revelations of previously-unpublicized problems that arose during the automaker's first foray into building an electric car.

In the early days, it sounds like Musk didn't even give his fledgling company, now 13 years old, a fighting chance at survival. On stage at the annual shareholder's meeting in Mountain View, California, Musk revealed that he thought the company only had a 10-percent chance of surviving when he first co-founded it with engineer (now Chief Technical Officer) JB Straubel. Saying that in the early days, they had ""no idea what we are doing,"" and characterizing their original efforts as ""completely clueless,"" Musk admitted that he wanted to invest 99 percent of the company's Series A funding, to avoid having investors and friends lose money on the endeavor.

Musk says that the company was founded in 2003 based on assumptions which ""turned out to be staggeringly dumb."" Mostly, he was referring to the original business plan for the Roadster, when Tesla's heads figured they could turn a profit on the Roadster by licensing drivetrain technology from the startup AC Propulsion and packing it in to chassis provided by Lotus.

As Fehrenbacher writes in Fortune, that daydream proved completely impossible:

That technology from AC Propulsion could not be reproduced and commercialized, said Musk and Straubel. That was partly because the information system that ran the motor was analog, instead of digital, so engineers had to rewrite all of the code involved. Another reason was because the AC Propulsion battery pack was air-cooled, which didn't provide enough cooling for batteries that get hot when they discharge to power an electric car. Tesla later converted the Roadster's battery pack to be liquid-cooled instead.

In the end, Musk said, the final design of the Roadster only contained around six or seven percent of the technology licensed from AC Propulsion and Lotus. The Lotus Elise platform had to be stretched to accommodate the batteries; Lotus's U.S. crash test results couldn't be applied to the modified design, necessitating expensive crash testing; Straubel revealed that the entire suspension and braking systems had to be redesigned for the Tesla.

Musk compared the ordeal to building a house by remodeling an existing structure until only one basement wall was left.

Even when all that unexpected re-engineering was completed, the Roadster was still a basket case. Musk said that when he took Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin for a ride in an early Roadster, the car wouldn't do more than 10 mph. ""I was like I swear guys it goes way faster than this,"" said Musk. Page and Brin ""were kind enough to put a little money in the company despite the world's worst demo,"" he said.

The problems continued. At the Roadster launch party in 2006, a few examples were on hand to give rides to potential customers. By the end of the night, ""the cars were destroyed,"" Straubel said. Musk admitted that the early Roadster ""was completely unsafe,"" it ""broke down all the time,"" and it ""didn't really work.""

Somehow, the company survived. The Roadster production process was completely overhauled in 2008 and 2009, with major changes to component suppliers and internal technology. Tesla also brought its battery production in-house at that time. It was late 2009 before Tesla stopped losing money on every Roadster it sold.

Musk said he wanted to talk about Tesla's early stumbles to let future entrepreneurs know that they can make mistakes and enter unfamiliar industries and still have a chance at success. But as we know, the young electric carmaker isn't out of the woods just yet.

Musk's ambitions for increased Tesla production are nearly laughable. He's already said that the Model 3, the long-promised $35,000 Tesla meant to bring practical electric cars to the masses, will likely be delayed. The recently-introduced Model X SUV has had so many quality-control problems, Musk has been living out of a sleeping bag at the end of the assembly line to monitor production.

The CEO's apology tour didn't just extend to the Roadster: During the shareholder's meeting, Musk also pointed out that the biggest problem with the Model X—those ridiculous ""falconwing"" rear doors—hasn't even been fixed yet. ""We're almost there in making the doors useful,"" he said, promising that they'll work better than regular doors within the next month or so."

But he said at Vox Media’s Code Conference that he doesn’t view Google as a potential competitor.

More clearly, he views that companies that might choose to work with Google as direct competitors to Tesla Motors. “Google’s done a great job of showing the potential of autonomous transport, but they’re not a car company.”

Apple, however, is another matter. There has been a lot of speculation as to whether Apple will produce its own car. Musk was a bit coy on stage, but of course he has more information than most out there — so if he’s taking Apple seriously as a competitor, there’s a good chance the idea is at least being tossed around.

“Apple, yeah, that’ll be more direct,” he said.

But at the very least, he thinks Apple may have missed an opportunity to get a car out the door that could be aggressively competitive with Tesla Motors. Apple is notoriously secretive about its special projects, but at the very least, it doesn’t seem apparent that the company is at all close to even getting close to the process of scaling up production for a car.

“I think they should have embarked on this project sooner,” Musk said. “I don’t know… They don’t share with me the details. I don’t think they’ll be volume production sooner than 2020. It’s a missed opportunity. There’s a dozen car companies of significance in the world, the most any company has is approximately 10% market share.”

A significant part of that uphill battle comes down to building the manufacturing capability, as well as establishing a strong supply chain. “The sheer scale of automotive manufacturing, it’s hard to appreciate until you see the plants,” Musk said. That being said, creating and maintaining a strong supply chain has always been one of Apple’s strengths — though the rest of the whole process is likely an unknown to the company.

In terms of whether Apple will successfully build a car, Musk was frank: “I hope it works out.”"

He also signed a deal with New Mexico, only to walk away when California offered more.

Here he goes again. Serial entrepreneur Elon Musk built his space, solar and electric-car empires with the help of federal and state incentives. Now Tesla Motors is gearing up for what's likely to be another bidding war among state governments: a manufacturing plant for the Model Y crossover SUV the company hopes to introduce in 2019. In June the Telsa CEO told shareholders that the electric-car maker is ""bursting at the seams"" and needs a new factory to build the Model Y SUV. Musk didn't provide details on where and when it will build the factory, or it's price tag, but state governments throughout the West and beyond are already angling to throw millions of dollars Tesla's way for the right to host the plant. ""Jobs are very politicized right now,"" said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit organization that tracks government subsidies and economic growth incentives. ""And states are more likely to overspend when one of these megadeals comes along."" Musk knows how to stoke that interest. The last time Tesla decided to build a new plant, he fanned a bidding war in 2013 among five states — California, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona. The states climbed over one another to offer free land, tax incentives and other benefits to become the home to a $5 billion Gigafactor, which produces lithium-ion batteries for homes with solar systems and for the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.

In September 2014, Nevada won the bidding with a package of near-$1.4 billion in tax abatements, land, road improvements and energy discounts for the plant that was built near Reno. The state also included cash in the form of $195 million in transferable tax credits set aside for filmmakers and insurance companies, and which Tesla could sell to other companies. ""It's an established MO for Musk,"" LeRoy said. ""He's very aggressive about getting tax breaks and subsidies from state governments, and he's brilliant at public media. He knows how to play them off against one another."" It's unclear how much it might cost to build Tesla's new plant. In 2014, Honda spent $800 million to build a new facility in Celaya, Mexico, to make Honda Fit subcompacts and HR-V sport utility vehicles. A Tesla spokeswoman had no comment on the company's plans.

Tesla makes its current fleet of sleek, quiet Model S sedans and Model X SUVs at a plant in Fremont, California, that Musk bought in 2010 for a mere $42 million when General Motors and Toyota decided to pull out. It has just started producing the Model 3 sedan there as well. In its most recent annual report, Tesla estimated that through 2016 it had received $100 million of an estimated $198 million in tax breaks from California to purchase manufacturing equipment for the plant. Tesla also received a tax credit in 2015 to hire 4,400 new workers in California through 2019, according to the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development. The credit has been valued at another $15 million. There's little doubt the state would be happy to entertain prospects for a new or larger Tesla plant in California. ""We have had an ongoing conversation with them for years,"" said Sid Voorakkara, the office's deputy director for external affairs, who wouldn't discuss whether the state has been in contact with Tesla about its new plant. ""As a general rule, our office does not publicly discuss specific company projects,"" he wrote in an email.

States know that large manufacturing plants mean jobs. Telsa's plant in Fremont employs more than 10,000 workers, the company said in a recent blog. The benefits for a state go beyond just the jobs created inside the new plant, says Timothy J. Bartik, senior economist for the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, who has studied the impact of state incentives on state economies. For every job created by the plant, there will be a total of two new jobs created in local suppliers and retailers due to the dollars flowing into the community, he says.

A hardened negotiator

""States are likely to step up again,"" Bartik said in an email. ""I don't know if there will be a visible bidding war, but someone is likely to bid; then others will counterbid."" If so, they'll find a hardened negotiator on the other side of the table. In 2014, with its deal for the Gigafactory in Nevada nearly complete, Musk suddenly added a new demand for a $500 million cash payment instead of some of the tax breaks, according to a report in Fortune. When the state balked, the company abruptly sent home 240 construction workers who were preparing the site. Eventually, the two sides reached an agreement, but only after Tesla failed to entice Texas to pay the upfront cash.

New Mexico has been around the track with Musk before and knows the pain of being left at the altar by Tesla. In 2007 the state offered $20 million in tax credits and other incentives, including upfront cash, for the carmaker to build its first plant in Albuquerque. The $35 million plant would employ 400 workers to make 10,000 electric cars a year, the state said in a release. Tesla ended the deal before the plant could be built and instead began talks with California, which upped the ante with its richer incentive package. Musk's use of tax incentives has put him on the defensive before. In 2015 the Los Angeles Times calculated that Musk's controlled companies — Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity — benefited from an estimated $4.9 billion in government support. A SolarCity solar panel manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York — scheduled to go online this year, though it has experienced delays — came to the city in western New York state through a $750 million incentive package. In a telephone interview on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" shortly after that story, Musk argued that his companies are not ""getting some huge check."" Instead, he noted that the incentives are spread out over years, generate jobs and require his companies to meet certain milestones to collect them. ""What the incentives do is, they are catalysts,"" he told CNBC. ""They improve the rate at which a certain thing happens.""

People believe the upstart, high-tech automobile maker’s EVs are different from other cars on the road.

See: Tesla’s Elon Musk set to make product announcement Monday

They are. But a big part of the Tesla difference isn’t so much about what these cars have as it is about how they are built and, believe it or not, what they don’t have.

The foundation of that difference is that Teslas — the Model S sport sedan, the Model X crossover and the coming Model 3 family sedan — have been designed and engineered from the start to be electric vehicles. Tesla didn’t have to make all of the compromises other car companies have made to squeeze EV bits into a package never intended to hold them.

Tesla also was founded and is run by a team of people committed to the idea that the passenger car can be both exciting to drive and friendly to the environment, that performance and environmental sensibility aren’t mutually exclusive. And while the cost of a Tesla isn’t low, it’s a price that fans are willing to pay.

There’s a lot of technology on board a Tesla, but remember: Much of the stuff is also available or coming soon on top-tier models from other major luxury car makers.

The Tesla difference is that all that technology, power and environmental friendliness — and a few things no other car maker offers — comes in one package.

Here’s a rundown of what makes Teslas special.

1. Design

Not so much the exterior — Teslas are modern, sporty cars, but they still look like cars. The foundation of the Tesla difference is what’s underneath the sleek skin.

Because Tesla designers started with a clean slate, they were able to develop the car around its electric powertrain and battery. The battery pack didn’t have to be squeezed into spaces previously occupied by a gasoline car’s trunk, rear seats or engine bay. And there’s no transmission hump or drive shaft tunnel.

If you look at a bare Tesla platform, you’ll see that it looks a lot like a flat skateboard. That gives the Tesla a fairly roomy interior and lots of cargo space, behind the rear seats as well as up front.

2. The ‘frunk’

The engine bay is where most other electric car makers put the charger, power inverter, electronic controls and, sometimes, the electric motor. But Tesla integrated all that into the parts of the car you can’t see. That left room under the “hood” for a storage compartment the company calls the “frunk,” or front trunk.

3. Fuel storage

There’s no fuel tank on a Tesla. There is a very large battery pack, which contains the energy storage cells as well as a cooling system and some electronic controls. All that is packaged into a flat box between the frame rails, under the floor pan a few inches above the ground and protected from objects in the road by a titanium shield. This gives the 4,600-pound Tesla a tremendously low center of gravity: The battery pack weighs about 1,200 pounds. That helps it stick to the road on corners or when you are hurrying through the twists on your favorite mountain road.

4. Instrument panel

Other cars give drivers lots of knobs, switches, soft-touch buttons and even joysticks to contend with.

Tesla puts almost everything onto a massive, center-mounted, 17-inch display screen that provides clear, easy-to-use, on-screen touch controls. The only buttons on the dash are for the glove box release and the hazard lights.

The speedometer and energy systems information are digitally projected onto a driver-facing screen where conventional cars keep their analog and digital dials.

5. Propulsion system

Most cars use internal combustion engines and multispeed transmissions. They have hundreds of moving parts, require regular maintenance and can’t be adjusted without a trip to the shop.

Teslas use electric motors that have two moving parts, and single-speed “transmissions” that have no gears. The company says its drivetrain has about 17 moving parts compared with about 200 in a conventional internal combustion drivetrain. The Tesla system is virtually maintenance-free. And because it is controlled by electronics, many adjustments and even repairs to the Tesla system can be made through software adjustments (more about that later).

6. Design (part 2)

The Teslas’ exterior designs are those of conventional — albeit quite shapely — cars. But because the designers didn’t have to provide space for an engine — which typically results in a larger, wind-resisting front end — they were able to pen a shape that is among the most aerodynamic ever for a four-door passenger car.

That means the Teslas slip through the air rather than bulldoze through, and that helps with faster acceleration time and, more important, longer travel distance between battery charges.

7. Electric drive

The mere fact that it is a battery-electric vehicle, or BEV, makes a Tesla different from 99% of the cars sold in the U.S. today.

8. The batteries

Tesla’s battery system sets it apart from all other BEVs. The other guys all use large flat or pouch-format lithium-ion battery cells, while Tesla uses cells made in the common 18650 cylindrical format. That’s the same format, but not the same chemistry, as used in most laptops and tablets. Tesla cells, which use a nickel-cobalt-aluminum-lithium chemistry, have about 50% more energy density than other BEV cells, which helps account for a Tesla’s long range and high performance.

9. Charging speed

BEVs can charge only as quickly as their charging systems — and battery chemistry and heat management systems — allow. Most BEVs use a 6.6-kilowatt charger, which means they can take on juice from a Level 2, 240-volt home, workplace or commercial charging station at a maximum rate of 6.6 kW per hour. Teslas come standard with a 10-kW charger and can be ordered with a double charger rated at 20 kW.

With a properly sized electricity supply, a standard Tesla takes on power at a rate that equates to 30 miles of range per hour, versus no more than 20 miles of range per hour for other BEVs’ chargers. Teslas with 20-kW chargers can gain up to 60 miles of range per hour.

10. Wireless updates

Pretty much alone among all auto makers, Tesla regularly provides software updates for its cars and delivers them wirelessly at the driver’s convenience. Most are free and upgrade various functions on the cars. One of the most recent is supposed to improve operation of the Model X’s unique but oft-criticized “falcon wing” doors.

As most Teslas are produced with all the hardware necessary for functions such as the Tesla Autopilot driver assistance system, the company also sells wireless software downloads to activate them. Most other car makers would require a visit to the dealership, at least, and most likely an expensive vehicle modification along with any new software.

For a limited time, the electric car company is providing a two-year lease program, but only on orders placed by September 12.

Under the terms of this new lease, customers will pay at least $593 per month in estimated payments, which will vary based on the type of Model S or X they get and how many miles they plan on driving it annually. Tesla announced the news in a customer email, claiming that this option is “one of our most popular requests.” The email also says that customers can combine this lease with Tesla’s referral program to get a $1,000 credit toward their vehicle.

Interestingly, this announcement also touts Tesla’s safety ratings and autopilot feature, which has received all sorts of attention. Launched last fall in beta, Tesla’s autopilot capability has come under scrutiny after multiple accidents were reported, not only here in the U.S. but also in China, with regulators still poking around and investigating. Also, in April, “about 2,700” Model X SUVs were recalled after it was discovered that they had faulty third-row seat backs. The Model S has also been hit by recalls.

The focus on the Model S and X line could be perceived as an effort to improve sales on Tesla’s earliest vehicles, as the company seeks to keep up with demand for the new Tesla 3, a model catering to the mainstream consumer. This summer, the company announced two new versions of its Model S sedan, which starts at $66,000 in the U.S. and is cheaper than its predecessor. The newer Model S 60 and 60D have less range and a smaller battery pack than the original Model S.

The announcement follows Tesla’s recent poor earnings report, in which the company reported losses for the 13th straight quarter."

Follow Him On Twitter For Updates.,"Before 2016 ends, General Motors (NYSE:GM) will bring to market the first affordable fully electric car with over 200 miles of range. The Chevrolet Bolt will boast an impressive 238 miles of range on a single charge, sell for $37,500, and be available at select dealerships in a matter of weeks -- or possibly even days. With this range, and at this price, the Bolt may serve as a compelling alternative to some buyers interested in electric-car maker Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) $35,000 Model 3, which Tesla plans to begin delivering late next year. Should Tesla investors be worried?

Inhibitor or a catalyst?

GM's Bolt is more than a new, compelling, long-range electric vehicle (EV). It's a preview of what's to come; GM, along with other automakers, are in the early stages of ramping up their EV programs. Indeed, most of the major automakers have announced plans to bring to market EVs with over 200 miles of range -- a segment that currently belongs entirely to Tesla -- during the next five years, starting with GM's Bolt.

With such a sudden, concerted effort from competition to begin building long-range EVs, it's easy to quickly conclude increased competition in the segment would be bad news for Tesla. After all, automakers' electric car and hybrid programs combined represent less than 1% of total global vehicles sales. Some investors might assume, therefore, that new competition in a niche market means less opportunity for Tesla to grow its sales.

This reasoning, however, fails to observe the bigger picture. Not only may competition not hinder Tesla, but it might even serve as a catalyst for the company.

Here are three reasons why:

3 reasons competition is good for Tesla

1. Tesla needs help educating buyers.

Educating potential buyers about electric vehicles requires significant effort. Tesla knows this firsthand and it could use some help from some bigger auto companies.

Indeed, one of the main reasons Tesla opts to sell its cars directly to consumers is because of the intensive education process involved in convincing some consumers to pull the trigger on a fully electric vehicle. In a 2012 blog post, Tesla explained how important education is in selling its vehicles.

That is why we are deliberately positioning our store and gallery locations in high foot traffic, high visibility retail venues, like malls and shopping streets that people regularly visit in a relatively open-minded buying mood. This allows us to interact with potential customers and have them learn about our cars from Tesla Product Specialists before they have decided which new car to buy. The Product Specialists are also trained to answer questions about EVs in general, not just ours.

At its stores, Tesla employees do much more than sell vehicles. They field questions about the motor, battery, charging at home, traveling, and more. In addition, the company doesn't pay store employees commission for sales -- an unconventional move that helps ensure its employees don't miss the opportunity to educate consumers.

Soon, thanks to major automakers' sudden appreciation of long-range electric vehicles, Tesla won't be the only company on the planet educating customers about why EVs with more than 200 miles of range represent a compelling alternative to comparably priced internal combustion engine vehicles. As major automakers bring long-range EVs to market, they'll not only put their massive networks of dealerships to work educating visitors about electric vehicles, but the automakers will almost certainly roll out major ad campaigns to promote these new vehicles, inevitably creating awareness for the feasibility of EVs in general.

Sure, the tactics used by competition to educate potential buyers will undoubtedly focus on selling their own EVs, but their efforts will also help raise consumer awareness for all electric vehicles.

2. Tesla needs a Detroit-based endorsement.

For now, Tesla is the oddball in autos. And this doesn't help when it comes to convincing the masses that fully electric vehicles make sense. Detroit is pumping out gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, fuel-efficient vehicles, and hybrids while Tesla follows a completely different path. Sure, some other manufacturers are selling a few fully electric models, but Tesla is the lone wolf when it comes to selling long-range EVs aimed to replace the family's gas car entirely, at least until GM begins shipping its Bolt.

But this is where major automakers' newfound approval of long-range EVs helps. With major automakers announcing a slew of plans for long-range EVs just as Tesla is readying its Model 3 for high-volume production, their new vehicle plans make it clear that Tesla's bet on EVs was spot on. This could help mitigate skepticism consumers might have toward Tesla's vehicles.

3. Soaring EV sales could fortify Tesla's lead.

Thanks to some big, focused bets today, if demand for long-range EVs does surge as automakers join the 200-plus mile EV race, Tesla will be positioned to benefit.

In particular, Tesla's Gigafactory, where the company plans to build enough batteries to help support a 10-fold increase in annual vehicle production between 2015 and 2018, will likely only increase Tesla's lead over competition if EV sales take off.

While it's easy to assume major automakers can wield their much larger cash positions to quickly catch up to Tesla's production, this ignores the severe constraints the auto industry would face with batteries. For EVs to take off, battery production won't just need to improve, it will need to ramp up to levels that make today's global battery production look not just outdated but even archaic. Consider the scale of Tesla's Gigafactory: It aims to produce more battery capacity annually under a single roof by 2018 than was produced in the entire world during 2013.

If Tesla's bet on long-range EVs proves to be well timed, its big, risky investments today could serve as major scale advantages for the manufacturer that could last a decade or more, enabling the company to distance itself from competition as battery suppliers scramble to catch up with Tesla's Gigafactory output as the company takes what it learned from its first Gigafactory and potentially builds more Gigafactories at an even faster pace. After all, Musk has said the Gigafactory has been designed from the ground up to be easily replicated.

The fine print

Of course, there are risks to adopting such an optimistic outlook for competition's impact on Tesla.

To start, investors can't be certain the young automaker will be able to execute on its growth ambitions as well as it plans to. If Tesla fails to ramp up vehicle production rapidly enough, the company might not successfully capitalize on the high levels of demand demonstrated by the 373,000 deposit-backed reservations customers made for the Model 3 within a month and a half of the vehicle's unveiling.

Further, it's possible that demand for long-range EVs won't be as substantial as Tesla hopes. If demand for long-range EVs doesn't increase significantly faster than the segment's overall production, a highly competitive environment could make sales growth challenging for Tesla.

Finally, if other automakers' future long-range EVs outshine Tesla vehicles in utility, style, performance, or features, Tesla may have trouble attracting new customers.

Tesla to competition: You're too slow

It's worth noting that even Tesla sincerely believes competition is in the company's best interest.

If this weren't the case, the company wouldn't have opened up all of its patents for competitors to use. From its battery and Supercharger technology to the user interface on the Model S touchscreen, all of Tesla's EV technology is available for competition to use freely. Going further, Tesla has even offered to share its Supercharger network with other automakers who agree to pay their vehicle fleet's share of operating costs and build vehicles that can handle the charge.

Indeed, Tesla remains disappointed with the pace of execution of other automakers' EV plans.

""I hope they move even faster than they announce,"" Musk said in an interview with Danish newspaper Borsen late last year. Announcements about long-range EVs like the Bolt make him ""glad,"" he said during the interview.

Furthermore, Musk even recently said he doesn't think General Motors is planning to make enough of its new Chevrolet Bolts.

So, will a Bolt-led surge in long-range EVs from other automakers really be a threat to Tesla? Or will a frenzied push of new, Tesla-like vehicles give a major boost to the nascent long-range EV segment and ultimately benefit Tesla?

Tesla is clearly betting competition is in its best interest -- and there's good reason to believe it is."

Cars aren't the only items that automakers recall. They'll occasionally recall aftermarket parts, which is precisely the reason for Tesla's latest recall.

Tesla issued a voluntary recall for its NEMA 14-30, 10-30 and 6-50 charging adapters. These adapters allow owners to charge on a variety of outlets -- 14-30, for example, is your typical electric clothes dryer outlet. The parts were sold separately as accessories through Tesla's online shop.

The automaker issued the recall after it learned in November of two customers whose 14-30 adapters overheated. The overheating didn't result in any property damage or injuries, but the company nevertheless felt the need to recall and replace the three adapters in question.

The 10-30 and 6-50 chargers are also under recall because they share some common components. The NEMA 14-50 and 5-14 adapters are not affected, nor is the standard Tesla Wall Connector or Universal Mobile Connector.

Tesla will mail new adapters to its customers, and in the meantime, it's emailed the affected customers and asked them to stop using the recalled items. Owners can always charge their Teslas using the slow-and-steady method of a 120-volt wall outlet or the pretty-darn-fast Supercharger system."

Silicon Valley’s Tesla (tsla) overtook General Motors (gm) on Monday to become the U.S. car maker with the largest market capitalization as the century-old automobile industry increases its reliance on software and cutting-edge energy technology.

That milestone is likely to be on the minds of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra as they and other CEOs visit the White House on Tuesday to discuss tax reform and infrastructure with President Donald Trump.

Helped by an analyst’s recommendation, Tesla rose 3.26% to a record high of $312.39 on Monday. Its market value of $50.887 billion exceeded GM’s by about $1 million.

Over the past month, the luxury electric car maker has surged 35% as investors bet that Musk will revolutionize the automobile and energy industries.

That compares to a declining share performance by GM in recent years that recently led billionaire investor David Einhorn to propose splitting the stock into two classes to help boost its price.

Tesla‘s market capitalization is now equivalent to $102,000 for every car it plans to make in 2018, or $667,000 per car sold last year. By comparison, GM’s market capitalization is equivalent to $5,000 per car it sold in 2016.

The Palo Alto, California company is rushing to launch its mass-market Model 3 sedan in the second half of 2017 and quickly ramp up its factory to reach a production target of 500,000 cars per year in 2018. Last year it sold 76,230, missing its target of at least 80,000 vehicles. By comparison, GM sold 10 million cars and Ford (f) sold 6.7 million.

With its stock down nearly 20% since 2013, GM has scaled back operations outside the United States while pushing to improve its profitability. It announced in March it would sell its European operations.

Reflecting Wall Street’s worries, GM’s stock trades at 6 times its expected earnings, the lowest multiple among companies in the S&P 500.

Proponents believe Tesla, which is not profitable, argue its stock price is justified based on long-term expectations for Tesla‘s growth.

They also point to opportunities from Tesla‘s acquisition last year of money-losing solar panel installer SolarCity and Tesla‘s Nevada battery cell plant aimed at driving down manufacturing costs.

ANALYST ENTHUSIASTIC

After driving a Tesla for seven months, Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter on Monday upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral,” describing Tesla‘s products as “captivating.”

“Tesla isn’t just another company. More so than any stock we’ve covered, Tesla engenders optimism, freedom, defiance, and a host of other emotions that, in our view, other companies cannot replicate,” Potter wrote in a report.

Skeptics believe Tesla‘s growth targets are unrealistic and that the company risks being overtaken by GM, Ford and other deep-pocketed manufacturers ramping up their own electric-vehicle offerings.

Its market capitalization remains smaller than Japan’s Toyota Motor (tm), at $173 billion.

Tesla‘s rich valuation has made it a target of short sellers, who so far in 2017 have suffered over $2 billion in paper losses as the stock rallied.

Jeffrey Gundlach, who oversees over $105 billion in assets at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, told Reuters last week: “As a car company alone, Tesla is crazy high valuation. As a battery company – one that expands and innovates substantially – maybe the valuation can work.”"

Tesla Inc. has been selling cars quietly from its Scottsdale Fashion Square store after winning a years-long battle over its right to do business in Arizona.

The California-based electric-car company got a dealer license Sept. 15, allowing sales from its store and ending a series of challenges that began in 2012 when the Arizona Department of Transportation told Tesla that state law prevented automakers from competing with dealerships.

A judge last year said ADOT interpreted the law incorrectly. Administrative Law Judge Jerald Hale said the intent of the law is to prevent an automaker from unfairly competing against franchises selling its brands.

“The evidence in this matter establishes Tesla Motors has no dealers in this state with which to compete, and thus, the restrictions and exceptions described in (the law) are inapplicable,” Hale wrote.

Tesla officials declined to comment, but it’s likely they made little to no announcement about sales beginning in Scottsdale because of ongoing litigation at the time.

ROBERTS: Tesla can now sell its cars in Arizona

After Hale's decision, the Arizona Automobile Dealers Association sued in Maricopa County Superior Court seeking to ban manufacturers from selling new cars. Tesla intervened, and Judge Joshua Rogers upheld Hale’s interpretation.

“The prohibitions of (state law) therefore have no application to manufacturers that do not have any of their own dealers,” Rogers wrote.

Tesla does not franchise dealerships like the major automakers because sales volume for the expensive cars is so low — most models sell for more than $100,000. They also worry that dealerships relying on volume sales of gas-engine cars would not properly promote the electric cars.

Today, about 1,700 Tesla vehicles are registered in Arizona, but most of them were purchased elsewhere.

For years, Tesla sold hats and T-shirts in the Scottsdale store, and employees talked with customers about the popular electric vehicles on display. But they could not discuss prices or sell cars. Customers could go online for more pricing information and order a car from California.

The Tempe Tesla showroom remains a service center and display area, without offering sales.

Tesla has about two dozen stores in the U.S., and has fought similar restrictions in some of the more prized large markets, such as Texas and Michigan.

After ADOT's improper guidance, Tesla lobbyists unsuccessfully sought changes in state law in 2014, and in 2015, arguing Arizona was missing out on sales tax collections. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the dealers association opposed the change.

Meanwhile, Arizona lost its 2014 bid for a multibillion-dollar Tesla battery factory, which the company instead built in northern Nevada, east of Reno. Tesla was considering locations in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada, and Nevada was the only state at the time allowing the company to sell cars through its direct-sale strategy.

Bobbi Sparrow, president of the Arizona Automobile Dealers Association, said Wednesday that Tesla should have to sell through dealers like other automakers.

“It is still a fact that we would like Tesla to sell vehicles through a dealership, and dealers have offered to be their dealer,” she said.

Tesla Motors took almost $10bn (£7bn) worth of pre-orders for its newest car, the Model 3, in just two days, according to the company’s chief executive Elon Musk.

By the end of 2 April, 276,000 pre-orders had been placed for the car worldwide. Although the Model 3 is Tesla’s first attempt at an “affordable” electric car, it will still cost at least $35,000 when it ships in mid–2017, meaning the company has secured $9.7bn worth of sales for a car still over a year away from rolling off the production line.

Musk estimated an average selling price of $42,000, once all the optional extras are taken into account, meaning that the actual revenue for Tesla could be even higher still.

Tesla still has to build all the cars, however. Even when total sales still amounted to under 200,000, Musk tweeted that the company was “definitely going to need to rethink production planning”. But the $1,000 deposits for the cars, even if it’s just a small portion of the final sale price, should help: the company now has an extra $276m in the bank to prepare it.

Although the Model 3 is supposed to be delivered in 2017, there is a chance it could be later: the company’s previous car, the Model X, eventually arrived three years late, due to problems moulding the seats for the car.

The Model 3 will be the third major car in Tesla’s fleet. The Model S, a luxury sedan, was launched in 2012, while the Model X, an SUV/people carrier crossover, was launched last year. Musk has repeatedly commented on how the model numbers of the three cars will eventually spell out the word “S3X”."

The update comes during an all-time high for the company as it rides a wave of success generated by its newly unveiled $35,000 Model 3.

As of Saturday, Musk said more than 276,000 pre-orders had been placed. Tesla requires a $1,000 deposit for people to secure their spot in line for the mid-sized sedan. The first challenge will be delivering vehicles on time. Musk said he feels ""confident"" the company will meet its goal of delivering the first Model 3 vehicles in late 2017.

""Tesla is addressing all three root causes to ensure that these mistakes are not repeated with the Model 3 launch,"" the automaker said in a statement late Monday.

The Model X, a stylish vehicle with falcon wing doors, was unveiled last September. However, Tesla struggled to hit its delivery target for the first quarter due to a parts shortage that the company said lasted ""much longer than initially expected.""

Parts Shortage

Of the more than 8,000 unique parts in the Model X, Tesla experienced shortages of just half-a-dozen components.

A statement from the company said its deliveries were lower than expected due to parts shortages. Tesla shouldered part of the blame, with the statement noting the automaker's ""hubris in adding too much new technology to the Model X in version 1.""

Tesla also called out ""insufficient supplier capability validation, and Tesla not having broad enough internal capability to manufacture the parts in-house.""

Back on Track

Tesla delivered only 206 of its Model X orders in the fourth quarter of last year, while the company reported it delivered 2,400 during the first quarter. By March, production of the SUV had reached 750 vehicles per week, however, Tesla noted in its statement many of the vehicles were built too late to be delivered to customers before the close of the quarter.

Since then, the automaker said weekly production of the Model X reached 750 in late March and it expects to meet its yearly target of delivering 80,000 to 90,000 new vehicles.

What This Means for the Model 3

The first orders of the Model 3 aren't set to be delivered until late 2017, however, the incredible interest in the mass market electric vehicle means Tesla is already working on re-tooling its production planning to ensure it hits its mark with the first deliveries.

A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 3, 2016

Tesla's Fremont, California, factory was previously used by General Motors and Toyota’s New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) and at its height had capacity to produce half-a-million cars per year. Tesla's website says the factory is currently capable of producing more than 100,000 vehicles annually.

Delivering the first orders on time will be especially key as more competition enters the market, Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book, told ABC News.

""The electric vehicle market is getting more and more crowded and as the months go by, there will be more competition from major manufacturers, so time is of the essence,"" Nerad said."

John Has Been Writing About The Auto Business + Investing For Over Years + For The Motley Fool Since,"There has been a lot of talk in the media about how Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 compares with General Motors' (NYSE:GM) Chevrolet Bolt. Bloomberg even went so far as to say that GM is now Tesla's ""electric enemy,"" because the Bolt and the Model 3 are so similar on paper.

I get why people are making that comparison. Right now at least, the Bolt and the Model 3 are the only two all-electric cars with over 200 miles of range and mass-market prices that are known to be headed for production.

But I think that comparison is misplaced. While it's a safe bet that some folks will choose between the two, it's not quite fair to either Tesla or GM to compare the Model 3 directly to the Bolt. Setting aside the similar powertrain specifications and starting prices, they're very different vehicles: One's a sleek and sporty luxury sedan, the other is an upright crossover SUV designed for urban environments and ride-sharing.

That said, there are three other automakers that should be very worried about the Model 3, because each of those 276,000-and-counting Model 3 reservations represents a sale that they could have won. Here's why.

These 3 companies should be very worried about the new Tesla

I'm talking about the German luxury automakers: BMW (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF), Daimler's (NASDAQOTH:DDAIF) Mercedes-Benz unit, and Volkswagen's (NASDAQOTH:VWAGY) Audi (NASDAQOTH:AUDVF) subsidiary.

With just over 50,000 vehicles delivered in 2015, Tesla is still a long way from ""disrupting"" the global auto giants, all of which posted sales in the millions. But as the company gleefully pointed out in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, U.S. sales of its Model S sedan trounced those of directly comparable sedans from the German brands that have long dominated the global luxury-car conversation.

Each of those brands did just fine in 2015, of course, thanks in part to other vehicles in their portfolios (particularly luxury SUVs). But for BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, sedans are their core products -- and compact sedans have long been their high-volume mainstays.

So here's the question: Given the huge number of Model 3 reservations, how will the new baby Tesla compare with BMW's vaunted 3 Series and its German rivals?

How the Model 3 will impact the compact luxury sedan segment

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday that the company had received 276,000 ""reservations"" for the Model 3 sedan it unveiled late last week.

Assuming that Tesla's ramp-up to production goes roughly as it hopes, how will those reservations translate into U.S. sales in 2018, when Model 3 deliveries are likely to begin in earnest? Let's start by making three assumptions:

Assume that 75% of those Model 3 reservations will ""convert,"" meaning that the people who hold them will end up actually buying a Model 3 when their turn comes up. Assume that all of those cars will be delivered in 2018 (and that any further reservations will be for delivery in 2019 or later). Assume that half will be delivered to U.S. customers. (Just over half of the 50,557 vehicles delivered by Tesla in 2015 went to customers in the U.S.)

Those three assumptions give us a total of 103,500 Model 3s delivered to U.S. customers in 2018. How does that compare to the Germans?



If 2015 U.S. sales are any indication, it compares very well indeed.

2015 2014 Change BMW 3- and 4 Series 140,609 142,232 -1.1% Mercedes-Benz C-Class 86,080 75,065 +14.7% Audi A4 and A5 41,947 50,613 -17.1%

As you can see, our projected number for 2018 would have put Tesla's Model 3 in second place in the segment in 2015, trailing only the combined total of BMW's four-door 3 Series and two-door 4 Series. And of course, that doesn't really express its true likely impact, as it will almost certainly steal at least some sales from the Germans.

But even if the new Tesla doesn't steal many sales from the Germans, it represents a lost opportunity to capture over 100,000 U.S. buyers that were willing to step up for a great electric luxury sedan.

Either way, executives at those three brands have a lot to think about.

The Germans will likely respond with electric cars of their own

I do think that the Model 3 will steal sales from more than just the German luxury brands. If the Model 3 didn't exist, some of the 276,000 reservation holders might well buy a 3 Series or C-Class. But I think plenty would have bought other ""green"" cars, a Toyota Prius, a Nissan Leaf, or a Chevrolet Volt -- or yes, a Bolt.

But as with the Model S (and almost certainly the new Model X SUV), Tesla will rightly be able to say that it trounced the German luxury brands if things play out as we've assumed. That has to hurt in Munich, Stuttgart, and Ingolstadt -- and rumors suggest that all three brands are already working hard on new electric vehicles in hopes of matching or beating Tesla at its own game, just as Elon Musk has long hoped."

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the Model 3, which is slated to go into production in late 2017, will sell at an average price of $42,000, including the price of options and additional features, which would give the initial flurry of orders an estimated retail value of $10.6 billion.

That intense interest, fanned in part by a steady stream of tweets by Musk, could help boost Tesla’s stock price, which closed Friday at $237.59, up 3.4 percent. The stock has soared more than 60 percent since hitting a 12-month low in February.

The car’s average selling price projected by Musk is well above the $35,000 base price. Analysts earlier had estimated the first Model 3s off the factory line in Fremont, California, could be loaded with extra equipment and sell for $50,000 to$60,000.

Tesla has undertaken a costly expansion of the Fremont plant, aiming to boost annual capacity to 500,000 by 2020, with production of the Model 3, the company’s first mass-market car, ramping up slowly through 2019.

Some analysts said the company could have trouble filling all the initial Model 3 orders, which are accompanied by a refundable $1,000 deposit, until 2020.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson on Friday said the heavy influx of Model 3 orders “sets the stage for an equity offering” later this year by Tesla, much of which would go toward factory construction and product development.

Johnson had estimated Tesla could take 250,000-300,000 orders for the car by the end of June.

Musk unveiled a prototype of the Model 3, a smaller companion to the Model S sedan and Model X utility vehicle, amid considerable fanfare on Thursday night.

Some prospective buyers who placed early orders may have anticipated paying a lower price for the Model 3 after factoring in a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric cars. But that credit begins to phase out once manufacturers sell more than 200,000 EVs - a mark that Tesla, at its current sales pace, is likely to surpass next year before the first Model 3 is delivered."

The nation’s top auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said on Thursday that at least some Tesla customers who experienced suspension failures with Model S luxury cars were asked to sign confidentiality agreements about the issue.

“The agency immediately informed Tesla that any language implying that consumers should not contact the agency regarding safety concerns is unacceptable, and N.H.T.S.A. expects Tesla to eliminate any such language,” said Bryan Thomas, an agency spokesman. “Tesla representatives told N.H.T.S.A. that it was not their intention to dissuade consumers from contacting the agency.”

The regulator added that the agreements that Tesla required were “troublesome.”

Tesla did not respond Thursday to requests for comment. [On Friday, the company responded in a blog post, saying there was no safety defect with the Model S nor any intent to discourage complaints to regulators.]"

Tesla shares fell 3.5% in early trading Thursday, dethroning the company from its position of most valuable automaker by market capitalization. They continued to lose ground during the day and closed Thursday down 5.6% at a six-week low. By the close, the company was valued at about $50.7 billion, slightly below General Motors’ $52.6 billion market cap.

Tesla first became the most valuable American automaker in April. That happened in part due to excitement over the Model 3, a $35,000 car that the company’s supporters hope could revolutionize the automotive industry.

The stock’s recent plunge came despite news Sunday that the first batch of Model 3 vehicles would reach customers on July 28. Investors were initially pleased with the news, with the stock jumping about 2%.

But a less bullish update a day later helped spark the selloff. On Monday, Tesla said it had delivered 22,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2017, just barely meeting its estimates. No stranger to production woes, the company blamed the miss on a shortfall of battery packs.

Goldman Sachs helped nudge the stock down further Wednesday, arguing that that Tesla shares would fall to $180 within the next six months, because the Model 3’s launch schedule implied weaker results than what Tesla’s overall production targets stated. The stock is currently trading at about $317. Goldman has maintained its “sell” rating on the company.

Still, Tesla could reclaim its mantle as the most valuable U.S. car company if it manages to stay on track with its Model 3 schedule.

But the stock remains highly volatile, in part because it’s considered a growth company. That means its valuation is based on what investors are betting it will be worth in the future, rather than a reflection of its present performance. So any bit of good news could add billions to the company’s valuation, while any roadblocks — like a mishap with Model 3 estimates — could sent the company back down to earth.

Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described Tesla’s market position in April. It became the most valuable automaker in the United States that month, not the most valuable in the world. The story has also been updated with closing stock price information."

Tesla deliveries are flatlining amid persistent production problems reinforcing concern that Elon Musk may again be setting targets his electric-car company won’t hit on time.

The maker of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles has reported declining quarter-by-quarter shipments for the second time in the past year. In addition to stoking fear about whether demand has peaked, these figures cast doubt on whether Musk can pull off a steep production ramp for his most ambitious offering yet — the cheaper Model 3 sedan.

“Tesla’s Q2 production and deliveries report raised more questions than answers, particularly about Model S and X demand,” Toni Sacconaghi, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, wrote in a report Wednesday. “The Tesla investment thesis hinges on the success of Model 3, and the ability for the company to ramp production, make the car profitably and deliver good initial build quality.”

Musk has a history of setting aggressive goals and timelines for Tesla and coming up short, including his calls for how soon the Model X SUV and less-expensive Model 3 sedan would follow the company’s top-selling Model S. His latest target — producing the Model 3 at a rate of 20,000 cars per month in December — reinforces the challenge ahead. That’s nearly as many vehicles as the company has delivered quarterly over the past year.

Tesla shares plunged 7.5 percent Wednesday to $326.33, the steepest one-day decline since June 2016. After the market closed Monday, the company reported more than 22,000 vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, down from 25,051 in the first three months of the year.

Demand for Tesla’s higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles appears to be plateauing, analysts at Goldman Sachs and KeyBanc Capital Markets said in reports Wednesday. Musk is relying on appetite for those vehicles remaining strong as the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company spends heavily to bring out the Model 3. Tesla plans to hand over the keys to about 30 Model 3 customers on July 28.

“While it is nice to see Tesla finally hit a stated target on time, we question whether 30 vehicle deliveries essentially built by hand count as ‘mass production,’ ” Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Co. wrote in note to clients Wednesday. “We also are surprised that this ‘mass market’ vehicle does not have official photos, options, pricing or really any details available.”

In the statement released after the close of trading Monday, Tesla didn’t disclose the number of cars in transit, a departure from previous reports. Deliveries were affected by production issues with 100 kWh batteries, according to the company. Tesla first introduced the 100 kWh battery, which has a U.S. estimated range of 335 miles, last fall.

Second-half Model S and Model X deliveries are expected to exceed first-half sales “provided global economic conditions do not worsen considerably,” Tesla said in its statement Monday. The caveat raised eyebrows for some analysts.

“Typically, Tesla’s delivery forecasts are not conditional — why now?” Sacconaghi wrote. “Is it fully confident in its orders?”

They can also have significantly longer product life cycles than their gas-powered counterparts.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk even disclosed having the ambitious goal of making Tesla’s powertrains last for 1 million miles – meaning that they would virtually never wear out.

On the road to this goal, the company has introduced several improvements to its battery pack, inverter, and electric motors. Now we learn that the automaker is introducing yet another update to its drive unit.

Last weekend, we reported on Tesla introducing a series of new performance enhancements to Model S and Model X.

Tesla wouldn’t confirm the nature of those improvements beyond saying that it was enabled by both software and hardware upgrades and therefore, it is only on new vehicles being built today.

We now learn that the new hardware includes an updated version of Tesla’s rear drive unit.

The automaker builds 3 different electric motors: a main rear-wheel-drive motor, a smaller front-wheel-drive motor used in dual motor versions of the Model S and Model X, and another bigger “performance version” rear-wheel-drive motor.

After updating the performance specs this weekend, Tesla changed the parts number of its main rear-wheel-drive motor. Subsequently, all the versions affected by the upgrade are equipped with this motor, while all the vehicles without it, the Model S P100D and Model X P100D, haven’t received any performance enhancements.

The company didn’t want to comment on the new drive unit, but it would have to be a significant update since it’s enabling a quicker 0 to 60 mph acceleration by over 1 full second.

Tesla’s drive units are built using a patented assembly process that includes having an electric motor, a power inverter assembly and a gearbox into a single, multi-piece enclosure – pictured above and below.

But Tesla has been working on new electric motors for the Model 3 and while it would only be speculation at this point, they could have transferred some improvements made through the development of the motor to its current Model S and Model X motors.

Last year, we reported on Tesla developing new power electronics from the ground up, instead of using off-the-shelves components, for the Model 3 drive unit. At the time, our sources said that the inverter architecture would enable over 300 kW of power – bringing it close to Model S performance, but we also warned that Tesla would likely update the Model S to further differentiate its higher-end performance from the less expensive Model 3.

It looks like it’s exactly what is happening.

For companies looking to create a sustainable competitive advantage in a fast-moving, capital intensive, and nascent sector like manufacturing electric vehicles, this is a simple reality that must be accounted for.

Every milestone achieved is met with the onset of new and more sophisticated competitors – and as the industry grows, the stakes grow higher and the market gets further de-risked. Then, the real 800-lb gorillas start to climb their way in, making competition even more fierce.

Visualizing U.S. EV Sales

Today’s animation uses data from InsideEVs to show almost nine years of U.S. sales in the electric vehicle market, sorted by model of car.

It paints a picture of a rapidly evolving market with many new competitors sweeping in to try and claim a stake. You can see the leads of early successes eroded away, the increasing value of scale, and consumer preferences, all rolled into one nifty animation.

The Tesla Roadster starts with a very early lead, but is soon replaced by the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, which are the most sold models in the U.S. from 2011-2016.

Closer to the end, the Tesla Model S rises fast to eventually surpass the Leaf by the end of 2017. Finally, the scale of the rollout of the Tesla Model 3 is put into real perspective, as it quickly jumps past all other models in the span of roughly one year.

The Gorilla Search

While Tesla’s rise has been well-documented, it’s also unclear how long the company can maintain an EV leadership position in the North American market.

As carmakers double-down on EVs as their future foundations, many well-capitalized competitors are entering the fray with serious and ambitious plans to make a dent in the market.

In the previous animation, you can already see there are multiple models from BMW, Volkswagen, Honda, Fiat, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, and Chevrolet that have accumulated over 10,000 sales – and as these manufacturers continue to pour capital in the sector, they are likely posturing to try and find how to create the next mass market EV.

Of these, Volkswagen seems to be the most bullish on a global transition to EVs, and the company is expecting to have 50 fully electric models by 2025 while investing $40 billion into new EV technologies (such as batteries) along the way.

The Chinese Bigfoot?

However, the 800-lb gorilla could come from the other side of the Pacific as well.

Source: The Driven

Chinese company BYD – which is backed by Warren Buffett – is currently the largest EV manufacturer in the world, selling 250,000 EVs in 2018.

The Chinese carmaker quietly manufacturers buses in the U.S. already, and it has also announced future plans to sell its cars in the U.S. as well.

How will such an animation of cumulative U.S. EV sales look in the future? In such a rapidly evolving space, it seems it could go any which way."
http://fortune.com/2016/09/02/elon-musk-tesla-cash-crunch-worse-than-you-think/,pos,1.0,1.103104168301074e-32,Why Tesla's Cash Crunch May Be Worse Than You Think,2016-09-02 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:40:15.858950,Shawn Tully,"Elon Musk has long been an enthusiastic advocate of controversial pro-forma accounting. Recently, Tesla’s founder and CEO introduced a creative new cash flow metric that’s supposed to present a truer picture of the electric automaker’s finances than do the official numbers.

Memo to investors: Musk wants you to count cash that Tesla collected up-front, but may not fully keep, as a sure thing.

Understanding Tesla’s (TSLA) cash flow performance is especially important right now. The company disclosed in a filing on August 31 that it will need to raise additional capital to support its proposed merger with home green energy provider SolarCity (SCTY), where Musk also serves as chairman. The news is raising concerns that Tesla already is facing a cash crunch, so it’s crucial to assess whether Tesla really can count on collecting all the money that its pro-forma reporting claims.

Reading The Small Print

The innovative approach to cash flow isn’t entirely novel. Tesla regularly issues quarterly earnings releases that include long sections of alternative figures for revenues, profits, and earnings per share. Those adjusted numbers always present a far more positive picture of the company’s performance than do the official results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In one recent quarterly earnings announcement, for example, Musk unveiled pro-forma figures that lowered Tesla’s official loss almost a quarter by eliminating “stock-based compensation expense” from total costs. As Warren Buffett argues, equity options and restricted shares are a real cost—and correctly treated as such under GAAP—because they cause dilution by shrinking the share of earnings that go to existing shareholders.

It’s well known that Tesla is deploying gigantic amounts of capital to boost sales from a projected 50,000 vehicles this year to half-a-million in 2018. That’s arguably the most ambitious goal in corporate America. To make it happen, Musk has grown Tesla’s asset base from $1.3 billion at the end of 2013 to $11.9 billion by June 30, following a $1.7 billion equity raise in the second quarter. Now, Tesla will need to accelerate its capital-raising program to fund the SolarCity deal. (See: 5 Things We Just Learned About the Tesla-SolarCity Deal)

It’s absolutely typical for a startup racing to build new plants and R&D centers to burn a lot more cash than it generates. Investors and analysts are mostly optimistic, predicting that Tesla will in a few years exploit its heavy investment by generating big positive and fast-growing cash flows. Hence, it’s crucial to examine the arc of Tesla’s cash flows to project when, and if, it will become profitable.

As with its other pro-forma measures, Tesla’s version of cash from operations looks a lot better than the official numbers. So which is the right figure for investors? As it reported in its 10K for 2015, Tesla made a major concession to an important group of customers. The shift was aimed at strengthening a fast-growing business, sales of vehicles to banks that lease its model S and X vehicles to end-customers.

In the past, Tesla simply sold the autos to its leasing customers, with no strings attached. The banks had no right to get money back from Tesla if, for example, the market for used electric vehicles dropped, forcing them to sell at lower-than-expected prices when the leases ended. But starting in the fourth quarter of 2014, Tesla began providing “residual value guarantees” to those “leasing partners.”

Those guarantees state that when the lease expires, typically after three years, the bank has the option of selling the car back to Tesla at a fixed, pre-determined price. Or, if the lessor chooses to sell the cars on its own and receives less than the guarantee amount, Tesla must cover the shortfall. Of course, customers have the option of buying the Model S or Model X for a fixed price at the end of the lease period, and if a customer does keep the car, Tesla’s liability ends.

But if a customer decides not to buy, the bank can return the car to Tesla and pocket the guaranteed price, or sell the three-year old vehicle on the nascent green used car market. Either way, Tesla takes a big loss, and effectively returns a lot of the original “purchase” price, if rates for used S and X’s drop.

Under GAAP rules, the introduction of the residual value guarantees required a major change to Tesla’s accounting for revenue and cash flow. As always, Tesla receives cash for “the full purchase price of the vehicle” up-front, when it’s delivered. But instead of booking that amount immediately as revenue, as in the past, it’s now obliged classify the cash—the average sales price of a Tesla is $100,000—as “collateralized borrowing” on the liability side of its balance sheet. In other words, as a loan from the banks that do the leasing.

The loan is really an accounting device. Tesla doesn’t repay the principal. It recognizes revenue in fixed increments over the lease period, and in takes a big sales gain when, hopefully, the end-customer buys the car at the lease’s conclusion. Those revenues aren’t collected in cash. They’re simply accounting entries that reduce the collateralized borrowings on the balance sheet. The GAAP rules are saying that the “sale” isn’t really complete because Tesla is still responsible for losses if it’s forced to resell cars for less than what it paid the banks under the guarantees, or obligated to fund the shortfall on cars the banks sell themselves.

Pivot Point

Until the fourth quarter of 2015, Tesla had been guiding investors to “free cash flow” in its earnings releases, defined as “cash flow from operations plus capital expenditures.” Those numbers accurately portrayed how Tesla’s cash consumption far outstripped it cash generation. For the first nine months of 2015, Tesla reported a negative $1.7 billion, almost triple the deficit for the same period in 2014.

Then, starting in the fourth quarter, Musk unveiled a fresh metric called “cash flow from core operations.” To reach that number, Tesla added “cash flows provided from operating activities” to the cash it received from its bank leasing partners, “net of revenue recognized during the period.” Officially, that money is mainly proceeds from a loans, not cash from operations.

In any case, the new measure makes Tesla’s position look vastly improved. For the first six months of this year, Tesla reported a negative $99 million in cash from operations. But by adding $385 million in cash received from lessor banks, it boasted “core” cash flow of a positive $285 million.

What To Believe?

How legitimate are those numbers? On the one hand, Tesla did collect cash for the full purchase price. But the payment is not the same as cash collected on a full and final sale. Tesla’s SEC filings are packed with warnings about the potential dangers of the guarantees. A statement in the 2015 10K reads:

“Our resale value guarantees and leasing programs expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues, gross margins, profitability, and liquidity.”

The problem is that these guarantees have a “long tail” of three years, and it’s extremely difficult to predict what three-year old electric cars will fetch on the resale market in the future. Here’s a typical admission from the 2015 annual report: “The resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs may be lower than our estimates, which are based on a limited secondary market for our vehicles. If the volume of vehicles returned to us is higher than our estimates and/or we are not able to resell them, timely or at all, our liquidity could be negatively impacted.”

In a phone conversation with Fortune, a Tesla spokesperson stated that it’s extremely rare, if not unheard of, for Tesla vehicles to re-sell for less than the guarantee price. The spokesperson explained that Teslas holds more value, for longer, than competing sedans because the company provides free software upgrades, free data connectivity, and free super-charger use, for the life of the vehicle.

The spokesperson added that “The NADA (National Association of Auto Dealers) frequently cited the Model S as having the highest resale value of any premium sedan or SUV.” Tesla’s view, said the spokesperson, is that its cars will fetch prices at the end of the lease period that are higher than the guarantee prices. Overall, Tesla considers its cash flow accounting as conservative compared with competitors.

Still, to buy the”core” metric, you need to believe that Musk is a much better forecaster than his overly optimistic car sales projections would indicate. If the guarantees he’s promising now prove a bargain in a super-hot, secondhand electric car market of the future, Tesla will keep all the money it’s now booking. But it’s also possible that secondhand S models will flood showrooms, and sell cheap in a few years.

“If the residual values are correct, they’re okay,” says Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer. “But forecasting is extremely tricky. We’ve seen this problem with computers that unexpectedly lost their residual value in the past. It’s not that a lot of other people aren’t working on electric cars.”

In short, the cash being counted isn’t really cash from operations. “What they’re really saying is that they hope to get the full amount from the guarantees,” says Ciesielski. If the used car market suffers from a dearth of buyers or a glut of green vehicles, Tesla will be forced to cover the shortfall when the banks sell vehicles for less than the guarantee price, or shed the inventory it’s obliged to repurchase from the banks at a loss. In either case, it will be returning a lot of the cash that it wants investors to believe is a sure thing. “Cash flow” that’s subject to a large contingent liability, to major uncertainty, shouldn’t be classified as cash-in-hand generated from running the business.

Tesla has attracted a legion of true believers who love the vision and don’t fret much over the numbers. Non-zealots should follow the conservative reporting that the official rules require, and ignore the pro-forma stuff. That’s the best way to track Elon Musk’s progress in molding an epic vision into the greatest green profit-maker the world has ever seen."

Rather, let his cars take over. Tonight, at a press conference, he announced that every new Tesla will be fully capable of driving itself. After being upgraded with a suite of cameras and sensors, Musk says this means his cars will have the potential for level 5 autonomy—the highest level, which requires zero interaction from the driver.

The current generation of Tesla’s Autopilot is really just advanced cruise control. It can keep the car in its own lane, and avoid driving into the vehicle in front. But try to get off the freeway, let alone navigate down a honking commercial boulevard, and the autopilot is back in driver's ed.

Tesla hopes its ghost in the machine will be fully ready by the end of next year, and the proof will be a cross country road trip. Musk said he could have a Tesla pick someone up from their home in LA and drop them off in the bright lights of Times Square, New York—then park itself. “It will do this without the need for a single touch, including the charger,” says Musk.

New cars rolling out of Tesla’s Fremont, California, factory will now have eight cameras—up from just one—for full 360 degree vision. Tesla has upgraded the ultrasonic sensors around the car's perimeter, too. And the vehicles have a new computer, boosting the processing power by a factor of 40. “It’s basically a supercomputer in a car,” says Musk. And that's in addition to updated GPS, inertial measurement unit, and other parts of the self-driving central nervous system. All this will be included in the new, more affordable, Model 3, too.

Tesla

But not for free. As with Tesla’s current “Autopilot convenience features,” turning on that functionality comes at a cost—$8000, up from $3000—even though the hardware upgrades will come standard.

Tesla has been criticized for rolling out autonomous features before the technology is proven. Consumer Reports said Tesla's autopilot upgrades were ""too much, too soon"". Just this week, the German government asked the company to stop using the term autopilot, saying that it gives drivers too much confidence, and makes them think the car is more capable than it really is.

Musk ain't hearing all that. Instead of taking a step back, these upgrades are him taking a tire-squealing lurch forward. Full autonomy has always been his end goal, because he asserts it will save lives. This despite the highly publicized death of a Tesla autopilot passenger in Florida earlier this year. Musk says that is nothing compared to the over 1.2 million people die annually in car accidents when humans are in control. Musk chastised reporters on a press call, saying that if their reporting dissuades people from using autonomous vehicles “then you are killing people.”

As always, Elon Musk is incredibly bullish about his timeframes. Tesla's fully autonomous cars will have to be able to avoid pedestrians, deal with busses pulling out, recognize construction workers holding signs, avoid kids running into the street, find parking, swerve to avoid that cyclist that just appeared out of nowhere, and solve every other—practically infinite—complicated driving scenario, to be considered truly level 5. Google has been working towards that same goal since 2009, and is still refining and reworking its the software that pilots its cars around certain cities. That company's robo-cars recently hit a cumulative 2 million miles, and it is still pretty cagey about a full roll out.

Not that Tesla is going from zero to 60 on this; the company learns a bunch from its full fleet of vehicles. Every car, even those in customers' hands, collects data and sends it back to the company's headquarters, where engineers analyze and refine the system. Still, the major automakers like Ford, Mercedes, and others are giving a 2020 to 2025 timeframe for their cars to become self-driving.

Musk admits his roll-out will be slow. Cars with the new tech will actually have fewer features than current Teslas. Active cruise control and lane holding (which make up the current Autopilot) won’t work until the cars have collectively racked up millions of miles of real-world driving.

Then, Tesla will update those features with over-the-air updates. The newer vehicles should be as capable as the existing ones by December, Musk says. Stand by: Musk has a track record of missing his own deadlines—even those that are self-imposed, and self-assessed to be lenient.

Then, if you believe it, comes the truly tricky part: Advanced self-driving. But not all at once. The cars will start small, perhaps by recognizing traffic lights first, and then graduating to four-way stops. Each feature will enter alpha road trials—which include on Musk's own car—only after meeting standards set by Tesla's engineers.

Only then will the updates be pushed to a wider group of cars. But still, the features will run in the background—so-called “shadow mode”—where the computer compares the actions it would have taken to what the driver does. Eventually, once Tesla engineers deem the software is safer than a human driver, the computer will have the power to take full control.

Automotive engineers agree that self driving cars will come sooner or later. Musk just wants to make it sooner. Much sooner."

Musk declined to answer a reporter's question about how the company will finance the cost of the upgrades.

Tesla said the vehicles now being produced will have eight surround cameras that provide 360-degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. In contrast, cars produced before Wednesday only had one camera. The eight cameras will work with 12 updated ultrasonic sensors to allow for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system, the company said.

To aid in seeing in heavy rain, fog, and dust, a forward-facing radar with enhanced processing was added to provide additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength. The computing power will also increase by a factor of 40, making the hardware capable of performing 12 trillion operations per second. ""It's basically a supercomputer in a car,"" Musk said.

""This hardware, combined with Tesla's existing over-the-air update capabilities, will allow the automaker to continue improving its self-driving capabilities with minimal inconvenience for owners,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, said in comments sent to CNBC. ""It's a big up-front commitment to self-driving technology that other automakers may not be willing to make at this point."" However, Michael Harley, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said it is ""actually not a challenge to offer a full range of Level 4 autonomous hardware to any new vehicle — this is essentially a collection of cameras, sensors, radars and processors. The most critical piece of the puzzle, which is missing from Tesla's announcement, is the car-to-car communication that ensures full Level 4 autonomous riding is safe for passengers and pedestrians alike."" Tesla cars made prior to the introduction of the new hardware will still see improvements based on such things as fleet learning and software updates, but their capability will ultimately be ""limited by the fundamental hardware."" This development follows a recent update to Tesla's Autopilot system where the technology was tweaked to make greater use of the car's on-board radar, and, among other things, included a warning system that will disable the feature if drivers ignore multiple warnings to keep their hands on the wheel. The Autopilot system has drawn both praise and criticism, especially since its alleged involvement in some high-profile crashes. Tesla has defended the technology, saying it is safe when used as directed.

The CEO insists that Tesla's Autopilot software and newly unveiled self-driving hardware will make its electric vehicles remarkably safer than conventional cars. Musk bristles during press calls at the mention of Autopilot-related accidents or broader anxieties about abdicating the wheel to a computer.

Yet Musk might be undermining his own safety claims by glossing over the cars' vulnerabilities and branding the vehicles as more advanced than they really are, transportation experts told Mashable.

Consider Wednesday's announcement that all future Model S, X and 3 Teslas will come equipped with Level 5 capabilities.

The designation implies no human is needed at all to drive or park the car. In reality, Tesla drivers will still have to control the car until the software can catch up to the hardware, a process that may take years.

Level 5 is the highest designation for automated car technologies, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers. Level 0 indicates a car has no automation, while Level 4 is a highly automated car that requires some human assistance.

Tesla's new technology would be closer to a Level 4, according to Alain Kornhauser, a professor at Princeton University who directs the school's transportation program.

""That is really dangerous, saying this is a Level 5,"" he said. Kornhauser said he worried that future Tesla buyers might slack off in the car, mistakenly assuming they were in a protective Level 5 bubble.

""Why oversell it? It's irresponsible,"" he said.

Similar criticisms have been lobbed at Autopilot. The system's name implies drivers can relax behind the wheel and tend to their smartphones as the car automatically steers, changes lanes and adjusts its speed.

But ""auto"" is misleading, since drivers still have to remain alert at the wheel, said Doug Newcomb, an automotive technology expert and president of C3 Group, a connected car consulting firm.

Autopilot was implicated in two deadly crashes — one in Florida, one in China — after the Teslas slammed into larger vehicles. In the U.S., Joshua Brown was killed in May after his Model S Autopilot system probably failed to distinguish a white tractor-trailer from the bright sky behind it.

The California carmaker is under pressure in Germany and California to change the name of Autopilot to something less sexy but more accurate, like ""driver assistance.""

""Tesla is sending the wrong message to people"" by hyping its technologies, Newcomb said. ""I think it does make it more dangerous.""

A spokesperson for Tesla Motors did not return a request for comment by deadline.

Still, Kornhauser, Newcomb and other experts all agreed that Tesla's technologies do make it safer than conventional cars — when used properly.

""These are cars that rarely fail and definitely bring the crash rates down and death tolls down,"" said Kara Kockelman, a professor of transportation engineering at the University of Texas in Austin.

""No technology is 100-percent bullet proof. There are drivers out there who will abuse [Tesla's technology] and that will make them less safe on the road,"" she said.

Tesla says it has taken large steps to address safety concerns with Autopilot.

In September, the carmaker rolled out ""dramatic improvements"" to the software that Musk claimed would have prevented Brown's death last spring.

The CEO previously noted that Brown's death was the first fatality in just over 130 million miles where Autopilot was activated — a lower rate than the U.S. average.

Musk has also claimed that of the more than 1 million auto deaths per year worldwide, ""approximately half a million people would have been saved if the Tesla Autopilot was universally available,"" he told Fortune in a terse email.

Again, however, transportation experts said Musk may be overstating the safety of Tesla vehicles and misleading drivers.

No fair comparison exists yet of how semi and fully autonomous vehicles stack up against conventional cars when it comes to safety, given how new and relatively rare those technologies are, said Nidhi Kalra, who directs the RAND Center for Decision Making Under Uncertainty.

""It would take hundreds of millions, or billions of miles to make statistical comparisons,"" she said.

Kalra co-authored a RAND report in April that found it would take decades or centuries to gather sufficient data from test-driving small fleets autonomous vehicles.

""If every vehicle were to be autonomous, we could know within six months how they compare to human drivers,"" she said. ""The challenge here is, how do we find out how safe autonomous vehicles are before the American public is able to use them?""

She said Tesla had likely gathered more real-world data than its competitors by equipping its cars with Autopilot and, in the near future, with full self-driving hardware. Even if these programs need improvements along the way or draw scrutiny, they're gathering valuable information to help cars navigate the roads.

""One reason to be optimistic is that Tesla is getting more experience than any other automated carmaker,"" Kalra said.

Kornhauser, the Princeton professor, said despite his concerns of Musk's ""dangerous"" marketing approach, Teslas are still among the safest cars on the road.

""He has a very good product, and he could be very real about it, and still people would drive it,"" Kornhauser said. ""I just don't see why there’s the overstatement of these things."""

Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla’s turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, Mr. Musk, the company’s founder, opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel.

Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it is burning through roughly $1 billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months.

Fortunately for Mr. Musk, investors can’t seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla’s stock has risen by 67 percent this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don’t expect, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations."

Yet Musk and his company remain dogged by skeptics, who point to Tesla's losses, debt load and shaky record of delivering on near-term promises about shipments and manufacturing as reasons to sell the shares short. Even as Tesla's stock has risen more than 50 percent this year, short interest has reached nearly 30 percent of shares that don't belong to insiders, as other investors bet on a big drop. Tesla stock is down 13 percent in the past month. Even Musk thinks the stock is a little bit crazy, and helped to spark more selling on July 17 with comments that shares are ""higher than we deserve right now."" What should Musk do to justify the hype while also meeting the legitimate issues that skeptics identify? We came up with suggestions based on Wall Street research and analysis from market pundits.

1. Hire — and empower — a chief operating officer.

The most persistent criticism of Musk and Tesla has been that it makes promises it doesn't keep, especially about how quickly the company can expand auto production. One solution: Hire a big-name chief operating officer with a reputation as a manufacturing guru. On a team led by a largely self-taught production expert who also runs a solar-panel company (the former SolarCity, which Tesla acquired last fall) and the rocket firm SpaceX, adding an executive who lives and breathes manufacturing excellence and fills in gaps in Musk's background would be a clear win. And Musk can keep on making pronouncements at offsite conferences about climate change and machine learning that suggest he's really more into vision — which he does better than nearly anyone — than operations.

2. Be more transparent about the things that matter.

Charley Grant, who covers Tesla for The Wall Street Journal's ""Heard on the Street"" column, rarely tires of pointing out that Tesla hasn't updated the number of Model 3's on back order for more than a year. It's hard to come up with a number that would tell investors more about the company's medium-term future and whether demand for Teslas is softening as competitors roll out electric models, like Chevrolet's Bolt. On the other hand, the Bolt has sold about 8,000 units so far since its launch in December 2016. The Model 3 backlog is about 400,000. On Monday, Chevy said it was extending a production shutdown at a Bolt plant due to high inventory. Jim Cramer noted on CNBC that Musk has evaded questions about whether missed guidance on shipments of Model X SUV crossovers and Model S sedans is a sign that demand for the expensive electric vehicles has reached a plateau. And no one really knows how to evaluate Musk's comment last year that the Model Y compact SUV, not even expected to hit the market until 2019 or 2020, will sell as many as 1 million units annually.

The answer is to give Wall Street more information.The best way to shut down guesses and surmises about demand is with real information that will let analysts and investors evaluate the long-term trajectory of Tesla's business.

3. Be less transparent about things that don't matter much.

4. Decide soon what to do about mobility.

Looming competition from Apple and Alphabet make Tesla bulls' favorite idea — that its electric cars will end up powering a ride-sharing network of self-driving vehicles — less and less certain. Wall Street knows Tesla is interested in the ride-service business, but details of how fast it might happen, and how Tesla might work with partners to bring it to market, remain obscure. The solution: Decide on a strategy relatively quickly and begin communicating it to Wall Street, including ballpark estimates of what it will cost to go to market and when. Musk's commentary on the subject has been in broad terms. The time to begin explaining how it will work is at hand. If the market decides the plan is workable, Tesla shares should move up toward the $500 best-case targets of bullish analysts like Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas, who thinks a mobility service would justify the price.

5. Consider separating the mobility and the car business.

Morgan Stanley estimates that Alphabet's Waymo mobility business could be worth $70 billion by 2030 if it takes even 1 percent of the world market for mobility, measured in miles. That's more than Tesla's worth now. CNBC's Jim Cramer has observed that self-driving car services companies, and those that sell technology to them, are likely to command much higher stock multiples than a maturing automaker like Tesla will be able to in the medium term. It's hard to say precisely what multiple of sales or profit Tesla Mobility might command as a separate business, or as a tracking stock if Musk chooses to manage Tesla's manufacturing and service units as one company for operational reasons. But either a pure information-technology seller or a tech-driven car service would likely command a much higher multiple than an automaker. A software-driven business that supplies multiple automakers (think Amazon Web Services, rather than Apple's closed operating system) should also be able to become profitable faster, with better long-term margins, than any business that depends on bending steel. Mobility will eventually generate a lot of money, for Tesla or a competitor. And a well-timed spinoff or tracking stock may be the best way to put the biggest share of that money in shareholders' pockets.

6. Turn profitable, Elon.

The biggest argument bears have about Tesla is that it consumes too much money, as investment in its Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada and other expansion projects led to nearly $2 billion in negative free cash flow over the 12 months ending in March. The fear stoked is that at some point the bond market will give up on Tesla, refuse to buy the new bonds, and the shares will go into a tailspin. The company's relatively low bond rating — Standard & Poor's rates its debt B-, which is below investment grade — feeds the argument. ""In our opinion, the direction of Tesla's share price will be dominated by (a) its pace of cash consumption, (b) the excellence and excitement of its products and (c) the openness of capital markets to fund the company's plan,"" Jonas wrote last week. The solution is to wean Tesla off of its near-term dependence on the capital markets by turning at least modestly profitable, which Goldman Sachs projects will happen by next year. Tesla has done something like this before, making $574 million of operating cash flow in the middle two quarters of 2016. Whether they can soon do it again depends on how many Model 3's Musk's company can sell. Tesla's $834 million R&D budget was spread over just $7 billion in sales. That should become a much less painful bite when, or if, the company demonstrates it can manufacture cars rapidly enough to meet pent-up demand, letting Tesla continue to invest in mobility while still showing the markets that a long-running payoff on its Tesla investment is just around the corner. But it could mean Musk has to go slower on other expansions, something he might not be willing to do. — By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com"

He said Wednesday he considers the fact that Tesla and SolarCity were ever separate to begin with ""largely an accident of history,"" saying that the time is right to combine Tesla's scalable Powerwall wall battery with SolarCity's solar panels.

Creating the ""solar-roof-with-battery product"" is the first piece — and that had been an element of Musk's earlier roadmap. Musk envisions a system that would turn individuals (or perhaps more accurately, homeowners) into their own utilities. This is why Musk wants Tesla to fully acquire SolarCity .

In the latest version, Musk paints a picture of a renewable energy enterprise, with goals such as creating solar roofs that are seamlessly integrated with battery storage, and an expanded vehicle product line that includes heavy-duty trucks and large passenger transport vehicles. He also reiterated the intent to work toward ""true self-driving"" vehicles that are several times safer than manual driving, and to enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.

Tesla Motors ' founder and CEO expanded his vision for the company in his second installment of Tesla's ""Master Plan,"" a sequel to comments he posted on the company blog in 2006 .

To unveil truck, bus plans by next year

In the plan, Musk outlines a public transport system comprised of autonomous buses, that could be smaller and sleeker than current varieties, and that could hold large numbers of passengers and ferry them directly to their destinations.

Some speculation prior to the plan's release revolved around the idea of Tesla becoming a public transport company. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas wrote in a recent research note that Tesla as an advantage over other automakers when it comes to its ability to transition into a public transport company because it could be more nimble in grabbing opportunities.

The company has both a Tesla Semi truck and a ""high passenger-density"" bus in development, and both should be ""ready for unveiling next year,"" the post said.

Case for autonomy

""If we wait for perfect, we'll be waiting for a very, very long time,"" Rosekind said, according to a Reuters report. ""How many lives might we be losing while we wait?""

Give the potential for autonomous driving technology to reduce the vast majority of the car crashes attributed to human error, the auto regulator said it is willing to accept that the technology might not be perfect.

This idea was echoed in comments made earlier Wednesday by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Chief Mark Rosekind, who said the regulator will not abandon its efforts to help speed the development of self-driving cars, despite the fatal Tesla accident.

He added, that it would ""no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named.""

He said even partially autonomous cars are ""already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.""

Musk explained why the company moved so quickly to stock its cars with its partially autonomous technology, called Autopilot, and why the company has resisted calls to disable the feature after one user died in a crash in May.

""When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else en route to your destination,"" Musk wrote.

How to cut the cost of owning a Tesla

""The point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good. That's what 'sustainable' means. It's not some silly, hippy thing — it matters for everyone,"" he said.

The initial plan also aimed to explain how the company's actions fit into a larger picture, ""so that they would seem less random,"" Musk said.

""Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much completely failed that objective,"" he said.

In Wednesday's blog post, Musk also said he penned his first master plan as a way to defend himself from the inevitable critics who would say he was ""just caring about making cars for rich people.""

""Elon paints an appealing picture,"" Brauer said, ""but a near-term plan for profitability, or even a substantial improvement in current vehicle quality, would have been more impressive.""

""The idea of combining self-driving technology with electric powertrains is underway at Ford , Google and GM , just to name three. Combining this effort with a Tesla/Solar City merger gives Musk a slightly varied approach, but a negotiated agreement between an automaker and one of a dozen other solar energy companies would nullify that advantage, "" Brauer said.

""Elon Musk's latest plan for Tesla follows the same path already laid out by several other automakers,"" wrote Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, in an email sent to CNBC.

Musk said owners will be able to add their cars ""to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla.""

The availability of autonomous technology will allow Tesla owners to ""share"" their cars with others, and even collect income as others use them.

The full text of the plan follows:

Master Plan, Part Deux

Elon Musk July 20, 2016



The first master plan that I wrote 10 years ago is now in the final stages of completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted of:

Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive

Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price

Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car

And...

Provide solar power. No kidding, this has literally been on our website for 10 years.

The reason we had to start off with step 1 was that it was all I could afford to do with what I made from PayPal. I thought our chances of success were so low that I didn't want to risk anyone's funds in the beginning but my own. The list of successful car company startups is short. As of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla. Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared.

Also, a low volume car means a much smaller, simpler factory, albeit with most things done by hand. Without economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive, whether it was an economy sedan or a sports car. While at least some people would be prepared to pay a high price for a sports car, no one was going to pay $100k for an electric Honda Civic, no matter how cool it looked.

Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to defend against the inevitable attacks Tesla would face accusing us of just caring about making cars for rich people, implying that we felt there was a shortage of sports car companies or some other bizarre rationale. Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much completely failed that objective.

However, the main reason was to explain how our actions fit into a larger picture, so that they would seem less random. The point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good. That's what ""sustainable"" means. It's not some silly, hippy thing -- it matters for everyone.

By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.

Here is what we plan to do to make that day come sooner:

Integrate Energy Generation and Storage

Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app.

We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies. That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together.

Expand to Cover the Major Forms of Terrestrial Transport

Today, Tesla addresses two relatively small segments of premium sedans and SUVs. With the Model 3, a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to address most of the consumer market. A lower cost vehicle than the Model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, because of the third part of the plan described below.

What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is being able to scale up production volume as quickly as possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the machine -- turning the factory itself into a product. A first principles physics analysis of automotive production suggests that somewhere between a 5 to 10 fold improvement is achievable by version 3 on a roughly 2 year iteration cycle. The first Model 3 factory machine should be thought of as version 0.5, with version 1.0 probably in 2018.

In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.

With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus driver to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would improve due to increased passenger areal density by eliminating the center aisle and putting seats where there are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and braking to other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial impedance to smooth traffic flow of traditional heavy buses. It would also take people all the way to their destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops would serve those who don't have a phone. Design accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes.

Autonomy

As the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system in the car could break and your car will still drive itself safely. It is important to emphasize that refinement and validation of the software will take much longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and computing hardware.

Even once the software is highly refined and far better than the average human driver, there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km). Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million miles (5 million km) per day.

I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future. The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.

According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report, automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every 89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better every day. It would no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named.

It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as ""beta"". This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed.

Sharing

When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.

You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.

In cities where demand exceeds the supply of customer-owned cars, Tesla will operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.

So, in short, Master Plan, Part Deux is:"

A fully solar power ecosystem driven in-part by SolarCity will help Musk and Co. get there.

Musk has been teasing the master plan part II for days. What would be in it? Would Tesla cars fly? Would they go to space? What does Lana Del Rey have to do with it? Why is Elon Musk talking about crack on Twitter?

After a near infinite number of browser refreshes, we now know.

For a quick breakdown, check out our gallery: The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”

Tesla is doubling down on not just autopilot but full autonomy. To get there, Musk expects a total of 6 billion miles of test-driving will be needed. Right now, fleet learning is happening at 3 million miles per day.

Tesla is also prioritizing development of heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. These products will be unveiled over the next year. The Tesla Semi specifically will support cargo and transportation services. The driver role is expected to transition to one of a fleet manager. A Tesla ecosystem of smaller connected utility vehicles including busses would be able to provide convenience, increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion. Such a system benefits everyone, not just the technocratic elite. Additional capacity, door-to-door service, and non-cellular methods to interact with the system would benefit groups yet to be touched by traditional ride-sharing.

The company is taking a page from Uber and Lyft and raising them with artificial intelligence. Tesla sees itself taking on qualities of a transportation company but rather than a human driver, Tesla will come to you autonomously. To supplement an early lack of supply in vehicles, the company will operate a fleet of its own.

“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” said Musk in his post. “This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.”

Pushing to bring down costs for the average consumer appears central to the new plan. Like Ford before him, Musk is prioritizing manufacturing optimization to bring costs down in the upcoming Model 3 and forthcoming vehicles.

In line with Tesla’s updated goals, the company quietly changed its URL earlier this week from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com. Tesla is no-longer simply a car company.

Even before the URL change, Musk had been hinting at this shift. In the first part of the master plan released in 2006, Musk described that his draw to the company was a desire “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.”

Musk deliberately said solar, not wind or hydroelectric, but solar.

Even on this alone, a Tesla acquisition of SolarCity could have been predicted. Musk expanded on his ideas to include a roadmap that has guided the company for a decade.

√ Build sports car

√ Use that money to build an affordable car

√ Use that money to build an even more affordable car

√ While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options

Tesla has done a pretty good job at first targeting customers “prepared to pay a premium,” and then “driving down the market.” The new plan picks up where the old one left off and provides guidance on how electric power can move beyond the car and into the home.

Tesla has already started moving into uncharted territory with regards to its development of Powerpack and Powerwall and the upcoming opening of the Gigafactory. Batteries were a small part of Musk’s plan but have grown to be a major focal point of the business. The new plan is to coalesce all of energy generation and storage around a single ordering and installation process. This means Tesla batteries are entering a long term intimate relationship with SolarCity solar panels.

The new plan, focuses on the solar ecosystem as a whole. Lot of new artificial intelligence and machine learning technology has rolled into place over the last decade and Tesla wants to take advantage of that as well.

The new simplified plan looks like this:

Ο Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage

Ο Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments

Ο Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning

Ο Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it

Tesla investors have been patient so far, but that was called into question amidst Tesla’s plans to acquire SolarCity. The company’s stock is worth 13 times its IPO value, but lately has been categorized as a risky investment by analysts. Dreaming big is easier as a startup. The larger a company grows, the harder it becomes to steer the rudder. I’m not one to doubt Musk, and given how accurately he forecasted and accomplished his last plan, others would be wise not to either.

Musk often — especially compared with most chief executives — responds to questions and comments on Twitter. Whether it is to explain upcoming Tesla software changes, to take feedback on elements of design or even to combat critics, Musk is accustomed to responding to his mass following online. His responses Tuesday ranged from matter-of-fact explanations to jokes about SpaceX launches. Musk responded to one user that the Falcon 9 launch seen by millions in the sky above Los Angeles on Friday ""was definitely aliens."" More than 13,000 replies to Musk flooded in with suggestions for changes, upgrades and new features. The CEO personally responded to a dozen of them, giving a look into what is to come from the all-electric company.

Electric pickup truck

One Twitter user told Musk that a Tesla pickup truck is needed. Musk responded by saying that he promises Tesla will ""make a pickup truck right after Model Y."" Musk is ""dying to build it,"" he tweeted. When asked if the pickup would be comparable in size to Ford's F-150 line of trucks, Musk said it would have a ""similar total size."" He added that the Tesla truck may be slightly bigger, saying he wants it to account ""for a really game changing"" feature. The other vehicle mentioned, the Model Y, is a crossover that Musk has hinted at both on Twitter and on a Tesla conference call earlier this year. Musk said in May that the Model Y would be built ""using substantial carryover from [the Model] 3 in order to bring it to market faster.""

The second version of Autopilot

Users asked for more information about the second version of Autopilot — the self-driving feature standard on all Tesla vehicles. Musk said the new software is ""going through exhaustive testing"" and said Tesla is working on features such as recognizing road signs. Musk apologized for the delay while saying Tesla has ""the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far."" ""The results are blowing me away,"" Musk said.

Upgraded navigation software

Improved navigation software was top of the wish list for another Tesla owner, who said that relying on their phone for accurate travel times ""is both painful for me and embarrassing when others are in the car."" Musk responded saying that ""vastly"" upgraded navigation software is coming soon.

Onboard and exterior camera upgrades

Making further use of the cameras on each Tesla was another request, with one user asking for the ability to turn all eight exterior cameras into dashcams — to continuously record the different angles simultaneously. Another user wants the camera to begin recording if someone forces entry into the car, and Musk acknowledged the request.

Location alerts for the family

Angel investor Jason Calacanis suggested a ""family arriving home alert,"" using a vehicle's navigation system presets to tell others when the vehicle would be returning to a designated home location — to which Musk said ""sure.""

Major browser upgrades

Others asked for updates to the Model S browser, such as a night mode and the option to open mobile versions of websites. Musk said that the existing browser is ""terrible"" but that ""major browser upgrades"" are coming ""to all cars in a few months.""

Added luxury features

A request for new Tesla features — music that quiets automatically when the doors all open, ambient lighting and disco mode — was met with Musk saying he would do all of them, especially since the disco mode ""sounds like good, cheesy fun."" Another person asked about further remote controls, such as turning on a Tesla's heated features via the mobile app. Musk says those features ""should be in the next update.""

Smart windshield wipers

The customers came. Now Tesla Motors has to figure out how to deliver.

At least 325,000 potential buyers each plunked down $1,000 deposits in less than a week for Model 3, which, at $35,000, will be about the cost of other Tesla models in a bid to put long-range electric vehicles within range off the masses. Now Tesla has to figure out how to ramp up production in a way that will allow it to fulfill those orders starting late next year.

Here are some of the challenges the upstart electric vehicle maker must figure out to grow from a niche maker of luxury electric vehicles for Silicon Valley's technorati to a mass producer of a car that might free hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of people from their dependence on gasoline.

1. Who will make it?

Will Tesla do all the manufacturing at its Fremont, Calif., assembly plant or elsewhere, or contract with an established automaker or supplier? Or will it go to Europe or China?

The French minister of environment and energy reportedly has offered Tesla the site of a nuclear power plant slated for decommissioning later this year.

Contracting with another company is unlikely. ""The genetics and personality of the company indicate that they would rather build the vehicle and the plant their way and not contract anything out,"" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

Producing cars in the tens of thousands per year, like Tesla does now, is far different from building 300,000 or more per year.

""The No. 1 issue is their cycle times. They have to speed up production, and you’re talking four or five times faster than they produce now. On top of all that you need more people. You need more stations on the assembly line,"" said Jay Baron, CEO of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor. ""Everything gets a little more complicated and the mistakes happen more often and with greater consequences.""

2. Can Tesla find enough skilled labor?

Tesla will need to find skilled manufacturing workers in the Bay Area, an area known more for its wealth of software code writers and electrical engineers than manufacturing. California is an expensive place to make anything, with or without union representation.

Beyond labor costs, Tesla might have to recruit in other regions for the industrial engineering talent to boost production by a factor of six or seven. ""They’re going to need to hire experts in scheduling, quality, training and supplier development,"" Baron said. ""It will take them some time. Those types of experts don’t come cheap.""

As Daimler learned through its failed acquisition of Chrysler, building luxury vehicles with the latest technology is not the same as engineering and maintaining quality in mainstream vehicles selling for half the price.

3. How will it sell cars?

Tesla must grow its network of retail and service centers, which now encompasses fewer than 100 locations in 24 states with a heavy concentration in California, New York, Washington-Baltimore and Florida.

Many states, including Michigan, are resisting Tesla's effort to sell directly to consumers without involving franchised dealers. Anyone who lives in flyover country may have to drive for hours unless they live in major metropolitan areas with a Tesla store, or gallery as the company calls it.

That model may work well for ultra-luxury products, but that's not what the Model 3 will be. Early adopters and environmentally conscious consumers will drive to the largest city to buy, but will they have to go that far for maintenance?

“It’s a separate skill set,"" Gordon said. ""Not only do you need a lot of money but you’ve got to hire a lot of people and you can’t remotely control it from California.""

Compromising with state franchise laws could jeopardize Tesla's control over the retail setting, not to mention pricing.

4. Can stock price survive need for more capital?

Raising more cash could deflate Tesla's stock price.

According to analysts, Tesla is burning through $400 million of cash each quarter and that's before the company purchases the tooling necessary to build 300,000 or more cars annually.

A Barclay's report estimates Musk and company will need $11 billion of capital over the next five years.

Keep in mind that the newer models will carry lower prices. Either the savings offset the lower revenue per vehicle or profit margins begin to shrink.

Gordon suggests that issuing more stock is the most likely method to raise cash. But that could dilute the lofty stock price, which has been part of what makes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's growth story believable.

Unlike traditional automakers who face a separate set of criteria by which investors evaluate their stock, Tesla, like many Silicon Valley companies, is selling a somewhat speculative vision of wholesale transformation in which drivers will leave the internal combustion engine for battery power and the sky is the limit.

Obviously, that premise is debatable.

""In the near term, it’s a game of maintaining confidence,"" Gordon said. ""To succeed at that, investors have to believe that the results eventually will be a viable car company that will throw off large profits.""

5. What is the core of Tesla's business model — cars or the Gigafactory?

Maybe the mammoth lithium-ion battery complex that Tesla is building near Reno, Nev., -- it's ""Gigafactory:"" -- will generate sales to customers beyond its electric vehicles. Perhaps battery-generated power and energy storage for homes and businesses will replace natural gas, heating oil and all other sources and batteries become Tesla's core product.

Battery cell production at the Gigafactory is to start in 2017, coordinated with the launch of the Model 3.

As our readers know, Vator has started a series called when they were young.

It's a look back at the modest days of startups, what traction they had in their first few years, and how they evolved. In the end, we hope to provide a glimpse into what great startups looked like in their first few years.

Stories like these are always well received because it reminds us that anyone, regardless of pedigree and environment, can rise above the noise and have great influence. They show us the value of being resilient, persistent, and committed. If we can follow their footsteps, maybe we too can have similar success.

This segment is on Tesla.

— Tesla's First Year —

Founders (ages at the time): Martin Eberhard (42), Marc Tarpenning (38), Ian Wright, Elon Musk (31), JB Straubel (27)

The name Tesla, from the investor Nikola Tesla, is suggested by Eberhard to his future wife while on vacation at Disneyland in January 2003.

Founded: On April 3, 2003, Tarpenning buys the domain name . Tesla Motors is incorporated on July 1, 2003 in Delaware.

Initial company description: ""Tesla Motors will build high-performance electric sports cars. This sounds impossible - both the idea of building cars in the first place, and further, the idea of building a high performance electric car,"" the company writes in its original business plan.

""But key technologies have recently been developed that make electric cars suddenly very attractive, and the international business climate makes it now possible to build a 'fab-less' car company - a car company without a factory.""

""As a electric engineer, I know you can make an electric car that rocks, if you want to and I looked around and said, 'Isn't somebody making that car?' and the answer was really 'no,'"" Eberhard, then CEO of Tesla, says in 2006.

""As far I'm concerned, I could not manage to buy a car from any of them. None of them were actually making cars one could buy. Otherwise I would have just bought one and been a happy customer, but, since it didn't exist, I said, 'Can I start that company?' I know how to start companies, I've done that before. I've done it successfully a couple of times now and I thought, 'If I can figure out how to take Silicon Valley know how, Silicon Valley know how about how to fund a company, and apply it to this problem, then we have something.""

— Tesla's Second Year —

First funding/personell, at one year from founding: In April, 2004, Tesla raises a $6.5 million Series A investment, of which $6.35 million comes from Elon Musk, who joins the board of directors as its Chairman. Eberhard invests the other $75,000.

Straubel first meets Musk at a lunch in late 2003, where he tries to pitch him on the idea of an electric airplane, which does not interest Musk.

""Through the course of discussion, and failing at that first discussion, we realized that we both had an incredible passion for electric cars. He understood and got the opportunity ahead of us, with advances in lithium ion batteries, better than anyone I ever talked to,"" says Straubel in 2016.

""We really hit off after that and it was only a few months later that we connected with the other early co-founders at Tesla. He ended up basically funding our entire Series A round and joining the team.""

Musk later meets with Eberhard and Wright. He copies the SpaceX articles of incorporation and bylaws for Tesla and has the same people who created the SpaceX logo also create the Tesla logo.

""At the time, 'Tesla Motors, Inc.' consisted of Eberhard, Tarpenning and Wright, plus an unfunded business plan and they were looking for an initial round of funding to create a more advanced prototype than the AC Propulsion Tzero. While there was a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn’t even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets,"" Musk later writes.

Musk asks Straubel to join the company.

Revenue, at one year and eight months from founding: For the full year 2004, Tesla sees a net loss of $2.4 million.

Second funding, at one year and 10 months from founding: On February 1, 2005, Tesla raises it's Series B round of $13 million from Musk, Compass Technology Partners and Valor Equity.

— Tesla's Third Year —

Product at two years and three months from founding: On July 11, 2005, Tesla signs a production contract for Lotus Cars to manufacture complete cars for what would later become the Tesla Roadster.

Revenue, at two years and eight months from founding: For the full year 2005, Tesla sees a net loss of $11.6 million.

— Tesla's Fourth Year —

Third funding, at three years and one month from founding: On May 31, 2006, Tesla announces it has raised a $40 million Series C round led by VantagePoint Venture Partners and Musk. Other institutional investors include Draper Fisher Jurveston and JP Morgan Bay Area Equity Fund, along with individuals including Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Nick Pritzker (through his investment partnership, Tao LLC), and Jeff Skoll (through his investment company, Capricorn Management LLC).

The company also announces that Jim Marver, managing partner and co-founder of VantagePoint Venture Partners, will join Tesla's Board of Directors.

""By leading the technology change from gasoline to electric vehicles, I believe Tesla has the potential to be one of the great car companies of the 21st century,"" Musk says in a statement. ""The starting point is a high performance sportscar, but the long term vision is to build cars of all kinds, including low cost family vehicles. Tesla is one of those rare opportunities to change the world in a positive way and build a valuable company in the process.""

Launch, at three years and three months from founding: On July 19th, 2006 Tesla's first production vehicle, the Roadster, is unveiled by Eberhard and Musk at an invite-only event at the Barker Hanger at the Santa Monica airport.

Traction, at three years and four months from founding, one month from launch: Within two weeks of the unveiling, Tesla sells 127 cars.

Accolades, at three years and six months from launch, three months from launch: In October 2007, Tesla Motors is named a recipient of the Global Green USA Product/Industrial Design Award for the development the Tesla Roadster.

Press coverage, at three years and eight months from launch, five months from launch: In December 2006, the Tesla Roadster is featured in Time Magazine as one of the Best Inventions of 2006.

""What goes from zero to 60 in 4 sec., tops out at more than 130 m.p.h. and appears to be missing a gas tank? The Tesla Roadster 100. It's pure California: a hot sports car that doubles as a statement against pollution and oil dependence. Its massive lithium-ion-battery array can power it for up to 250 miles of highway travel, and even though it will fatten your electricity bill, the Roadster is still twice as efficient as a Toyota Prius,"" Time writes.

The Roadster is also chosen by Forbes as one of the best cars of 2006, which labels it as the ""New Car That Best Lived Up to the Hype.""

""Perhaps this year’s most-discussed car, the Roadster from California’s Tesla Motors proves that electric cars need not look like science experiments, and can in fact be as sexy and capable as race cars. The Roadster sold out in four months; the most you can do if you want one is reserve a 2008 model,"" Forbes writes.

Revenue, at three years and eight months from founding: For the full year 2006, Tesla sees a net loss of $30 million.

— Tesla's Fifth Year —

Fourth funding, at four years and one month from founding, 10 months from launch: On May 11, 2007, Tesla reveals that it has raised a $45 million Series D round of funding. The round is co-led by Technology Partners and by Musk. An additional investment is made by Capricorn Investment Group. All major investors from prior rounds of financing fully participated in this round, including Vantage Point Venture Partners, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, JP Morgan Bay Area Equity Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Compass Venture Partners.

Ira Ehrenpreis, leader of Technology Partners' Cleantech investment practice, joins Tesla Motors' Board of Directors, as does Antonio Gracias, founder and CEO of Valor Equity Partners.

Traction, at four years and one month from founding, 10 months from launch: By May of 2007, over 400 reservations have been taken for the Tesla Roadster.

Business model, at four years and one month from founding, 10 months from launch: In May 2007, Tesla announces the launch of Tesla Energy Group, which is created in late 2006 to allow the company to design and sell Energy Storage Systems to other companies, specifically large lithium ion battery packs made from small, commodity cells.

""More than any other subsystem on the Tesla Roadster, the ESS has required fundamental invention and clever solutions to tricky problems. Nobody makes anything like the Tesla Motors ESS; it’s impossible to hire people with 'prior experience,' so the ESS team is dominated by bright, young engineers with a lot of creativity and enthusiasm. Together, they have filed more patents than any other group at the company. Impossible is a word that has no meaning for them,"" writes Eberhard.

Bernard Tse, the former founder and CEO of Wyse Technology, step down from Tesla's board and lead Tesla Energy Group.

Personnel, at four years and four months from founding, one year and one month from launch: In August 2007, Musk calls Eberhard to tell him that he has been fired as CEO of Tesla by the company's board of directors. Michael Marks, an early investor in the company, becomes interim CEO.

Eberhard asks that the board have another meeting and he officially resigns on August 8, 2007, becoming President of Technology.

Personnel, at four years and seven months from founding, one year and one five from launch: In November 2007, Ze'ev Drori is named CEO and President of Tesla.

Revenue, at four years and eight months from launch, one year and five months from launch: At the end of 2007, Tesla sees $73,000 in revenue for the year, along with a $78 million net loss.

Product, at four years and 10 months from founding, one year and seven months from launch: On February 1, 2008, the first production Tesla Roadster is delivered to Musk at his house.

Fifth funding, at four years and 10 months from founding, one year and seven months from launch: On February 19, 2008, Tesla announces it has raised $40 million in a Series E round. The round is co-led by Valor Equity Partners and Musk.

Product, at four years and 11 months from founding, one year and eight months from launch: In March 2008, regular production begins on the Tesla Roadster.

""While this is an important milestone for the company and a watershed for the new era of electric vehicles, we still have a lot of work to do. Our key focus with the Roadster will be on gradually ramping up our production in a deliberate and controlled manner reaching a rate of over 100 Roadsters per month early next year,"" Drori writes in a blog post.

— Tesla Today —

In June, 2008, Tesla announced the Model S, and Musk took over as CEO of the company in October of that year. Between 2008 and March 2012, Tesla sold more than 2,250 Roadsters in 31 countries.

In June 2010, Tesla became the first American car maker to go public since Ford in 1956; it raised $26 million at $17 a share. It is now trading at $306.53 a share.

Those of us who live and work in the “salt mines” of machine learning and artificial intelligence are almost universally unafraid. Still, a few well-known technical folk heroes continue to push this “sky is falling” narrative. The most prolific of them is Elon Musk, famed founder of Tesla and SpaceX. Not only do I think he’s wrong, I think his own company, Tesla Motors, is a compelling proof point against his argument.

When it comes to AI, Musk and Tesla are a fascinating combination of contradictions. Tesla is one of the heaviest AI manufacturing companies in the world. The company almost single-handedly started the discussion on self-driving cars. (How much more “AI” can you get than a self-driving car?) Yet even while investing billions into AI to make smart self-driving cars, Musk rails against AI as a threat to our very existence. This is an especially strange narrative when you consider Tesla’s own difficulties with AI: The company produced just 260 new Model 3 cars in the third quarter of 2017, with Musk blaming the delays on a subcontractor dropping the ball, which required Tesla to “rewrite the software from scratch.” Rumor has it that the software in question was an AI element of the battery module production line.

Let me stop here for a moment and drill down on this point: Tesla has bet its future on fully automating the production of the Model 3, removing humans from the equation entirely. I’ll admit, I know nothing about manufacturing cars, but I do know software, and I think this is a shrewd play. A new, fully automated manufacturing process is going to take a while to sort out and get operating well. But once researchers work through those bugs, the line will move much faster than it ever could with humans as part of the process.

Let’s return to our original question, “Will machines destroy their flawed human masters?” The AI to run a factory is very complex and hard to get right, but at least there are a finite number of variables involved. Even so, Tesla has a difficult time bringing this online. If you can’t make machines solve a finite state problem that is pretty unchanged from day to day, I’m not sure why you’d ever worry that the machines will become self-aware and destroy us.

Tesla is having a tough time bringing its automated production facility online, yet Tesla and all the other car manufacturers want us to trust them to build a fully self-driving car. I don’t know about you, but that scares me. As hard as it is to build the AI for an automated manufacturing facility, it’s a whole lot easier than building the AI for a self-driving car. A car is produced the same way today as it was yesterday, and the same way it’ll be produced tomorrow. On the other hand, there are always new and unexpected variables in navigating the traffic from your house to the corner store. So if you can’t automate your production facility with absolute perfection, don’t ask me to believe my car can drive me anywhere I want in safety.

In time, AI will get better at approximating human intelligence, but we are still a long, long way from that point. So, I’m sorry Elon, but I don’t think Arnie and Cyberdyne will destroy the planet anytime soon. The technology to make that kind of leap doesn’t yet exist, and personally, I doubt it ever will.

After two years of stalled plans, electric car maker Tesla Motors is about a week away from finally opening San Antonio’s first Tesla showroom and service center.

But you still won’t be able to buy any of the company’s vehicles there.

Instead, the showroom, tentatively set to open Friday on the Northwest Side, will serve as an “educational hub” for potential customers to test drive and learn about the electric vehicles’ functions, according to a company spokeswoman who asked not to be identified.

Tesla is not allowed by law to sell its vehicles directly in Texas. The automaker has been working since 2013 to get the law changed, but Texas auto dealerships have stiffly resisted legislation that would allow direct sales. The dealers successfully defeated attempts to change the law in 2013 and 2015. But Tesla hasn’t given up the battle. New legislation has been introduced for this year’s legislative session.

In the meantime, Tesla has been opening showrooms in the state. Although it’s already opened eight sites in Texas, none of those are in San Antonio. The closest showroom and service center for San Antonians has been one in Austin.

But Tesla is wrapping up a $250,000 renovation to turn the 13,000-square-foot building at 23011 Interstate 10 West into the state’s newest gallery and service center. The building, which is across from The Dominion, used to serve as the San Antonio headquarters of cybersecurity company E-Watch.

The opening of the showroom comes after two previous attempts to move into the San Antonio market. The first was a February 2015 request to build a two-story, 24,475-square-foot showroom east of U.S. 281 at Loop 1604 that fizzled out. The second attempt, a proposal for a site near The Shops at La Cantera, was rejected by the Zoning Commission due to concerns over contamination risks to the Edwards Aquifer posed by the storage of lithium-ion car batteries stored on site.

While Tesla has struggled to open a showroom in San Antonio, it has built some of the needed infrastructure. Five charging stations are located at downtown hotels, while a sixth is at a Northwest Side hotel. But those chargers are reserved for hotel patrons. The closest “Supercharger” stations — which can recharge a Model S sedan or Model X SUV in roughly 30 minutes — are located in San Marcos and Three Rivers. A third is located in Victoria.

The company, which three months ago aimed to make a net profit in the final quarter of this year, gave no profit target on Wednesday and said capital spending would rise about 50 percent more than previously forecast this year, to around $2.25 billion.

New shares and debt will likely be issued at some point, Chief Executive Elon Musk added.

Tesla, which produces the luxury Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, aims to become a high-volume automaker in a matter of years and already is valued on par with some of the biggest car companies in the world.

Shares of the company, run by tech entrepreneur Musk, rose more than 5 percent in after hours trade after it announced its first-quarter results and beefed-up production targets.

Musk’s ambitions for clean cars, as well as rocket and solar businesses, have attracted a personal following often compared to that of the late Steve Jobs, but skeptics are also legion.

Tesla reported a wider first-quarter net loss, although results broadly beat Wall Street targets. It also said it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year, as it accelerated its target for Model 3 output.

Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth, who rates Tesla shares “neutral,” said growing pains were to be expected while Tesla ramps up, but the company’s cars were “close to perfect.”

“It’s going to be challenging, making cars is hard and there are all sorts of moving parts and competition will come from known and unknown places,” said Feinseth.

“I will suggest it’s going to take a lot of capital. But car manufacturing is a capital intensive business. (Musk) has had no problem raising money in the past.”

The Model 3 sedan, set to go into production in late 2017, has generated massive interest since its unveiling on March 31.

Some analysts have questioned Tesla’s ability to smoothly and quickly transition to higher-volume production, given the rocky start for its Model X. The technology-heavy SUV faced problems including parts shortages and quality issues, such as non-fastening doors.

Early on Wednesday, before announcing its financial results, Tesla said two top manufacturing executives were leaving the company.

Musk said the company had excelled at design and technology, but a new premium was being placed on manufacturing: “The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing,” Musk said. “It’s the thing we obviously have to solve if we are going to scale and scale profitably.”

Standard and Poor’s Global Market Intelligence analyst Efraim Levy said the 500,000 unit production target sets a very high bar for Tesla.

“I would be betting that they don’t make it,” he said.

Musk also said a 2020 volume target was close to 1 million vehicles.

Tesla’s new 500,000 target is still a fraction of what traditional, full-line automakers produce annually. Ford Motor Co (F.N) sold nearly 800,000 of its best-selling F-Series pickups on the U.S. market last year.

Tesla’s net loss widened to $282.3 million, or $2.13 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $154.2 million, or $1.22 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company lost 57 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 58 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose to $1.15 billion from $939.9 million. (bit.ly/1rVkm03). Non-GAAP revenue of $1.60 billion just topped the analyst consensus, by about $5 million."

Tesloop, you’ll recall, ferries passengers between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in electric Tesla vehicles, making it easy to rack up that many miles in a year. Not many electric cars of any make or model have reached this kind of mileage, so I was curious to find out how the Tesla is holding up.

I called Rahul Sonnad at Tesloop, who noted that these were nearly all highway miles, and the Model S was in Auto Pilot mode most of that time. According to Tesla, city vs. highway miles aren’t such a big deal in electric cars, but it’s worth mentioning.

“We did have a few things go wrong,” Sonnad said. At about 30,000 miles, the car was relaying messages to Tesla HQ that the motor was operating at low power. “Tesla called us up and told us that,” Sonnad said. “We didn’t notice any problems. It was super fast.” But Tesla had the company bring the car in, and it replaced the front motor.

The bigger issue, and the bigger question that everybody asks about, according to Sonnad, is battery degradation. That was my question too. The Tesloop Model S has only degraded about 6%, even though it’s being charged to 100% every day, rather than the default—and recommended—90% charge.

“For your daily driver, you don’t fully charge unless you’re doing a long trip,” Sonnad said. “We’re doing a long trip every day. We save, like, three minutes in charging in Barstow if we fully charge beforehand. We decided that we’re gonna suck it up, fully charge, and let it degrade. We figured that if it degraded enough, we could take it off a Vegas route and put it on a local Orange County route.”

Then, just as the car hit 200,000 miles, the range estimator became inaccurate. Though the car didn’t actually lose any range, the estimator would say it could go another ten miles—and then power down. Tesla looked into the issue, and told Tesloop that there’s a battery chemistry state that high-mileage cars go into, and the software isn’t properly compensating for that change. There will be a firmware update in three months that will take care of the discrepancy, but Tesla just replaced the battery to solve the problem. “We got our 6% range back with the new battery,” Sonnad said with a laugh. “But had the firmware been updated, we’d be fine and plugging along.”

Tesloop has paid to replace the car’s 12-volt battery for $190, and it buys sets of off-the-shelf 40,000-mile Goodyear tires pretty regularly, for a total of about $2,500 in the past year. And those are the only maintenance costs it’s had, thanks to Tesla’s unlimited 8-year warranty. “We haven’t even replaced the brakes,” Sonnad said.

I wondered if Tesloop, given how it’s using these cars, has any extra warranty or service deal with Tesla. “It’s nothing special; we’re under the standard warranties and everything,” Sonnad said. “We now have a lot of first-name friends in the service department, and we ask a lot of questions. And the car is in there for various inspections.”

He also noted that Tesloop’s car reached this mileage in just a year. It would take most people a decade to drive this many miles, and over that time it’s likely that a bunch of little things will fail. “I buy old cars personally, 20-year old cars, and things don’t work like they should on those cars,” Sonnad said. “There are issues like those that we didn’t encounter in one year, but not any in the drivetrain.”"

(TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk told employees in an email to follow company policy of not offering discounts on new cars, responding to some investors’ concerns about the practice.

In a Twitter message, Musk said “corrective action” had been taken on discounting of new vehicles, which “seems to be limited to a small number of cases.”

Musk’s email to employees was included on Wednesday in a response to comments on a Reddit posting of someone questioning the discount policy.

The Tesla boss said, “It is absolutely vital that we adhere to the no negotiation and no discount policy that has been true since we first started taking orders 10 years ago.”

Musk said there could be discounts to floor models, vehicles that had been used for testing or those that were damaged in delivery.

“However, there can never - and I mean never - be a discount on a new car coming out of the factory in pristine condition, where there is no underlying rationale,” he said. Musk was responding to a research note published on Tuesday by analyst Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest Securities that criticized Tesla for offering discounts on Model S sedan inventory cars, not those built-to-order for specific customers, to boost third-quarter sales.

“We found Tesla has been employing a deeper discounting formula to drive sales of inventory models, with all offers expiring this Friday, the last day of the quarter,” Erikson wrote.

Erickson said he “detected aggressive Model S discounting at U.S. sales centers to maximize third-quarter deliveries.”

Deliveries for the quarter will be about 22,000, said Erickson, up 90 percent from a year earlier.

Mike Ramsey, automotive analyst with Gartner Inc., said discounts on Model S vehicles have been few, and that it was “inevitable” that the car, which debuted in 2012 and often sells at $100,000, would eventually be discounted.

“There isn’t unlimited demand for $100,000 vehicles,” he said, although he noted that Musk is adamant about no routine discounts for both customers and employees. Musk said in the email that the current quarter “is likely to be the best ever in Tesla history.”

Tesla has posted an operating loss in 14 consecutive quarters and negative cash flow since early 2014. It is facing a cash crunch at a time when it seeks to purchase its money-losing sister company, SolarCity Corp SCTY.O.

The average September U.S. new vehicle discount industrywide is about $3,900, the highest since December 2009, J.D. Power said this week."

""Made in America"" can be a powerful selling point, especially after a presidential election in which domestic manufacturing jobs were a hot-button issue.

But in the age of globalization, U.S. automakers no longer have a monopoly on cars with largely American-made content.

Every year, the Kogod School of Business at American University publishes rankings of the most ""American-made"" cars, with the top spots occupied by a mix of domestic and foreign models.

The rankings are based on such factors as the proportion of American-made parts, labor, and the amount of development work conducted in the U.S.

So where might the Tesla Model 3 rank when it starts production later this year?

In 2016, the Toyota Camry mid-size sedan and Sienna minivan were rated 78.5 percent American-made, while different analyses in past years have dubbed the Camry the ""most American"" vehicle.

The Honda Accord mid-size sedan was determined to be 81 percent American-made last year, while the Chevrolet Corvette sports car came in at 83 percent. The Ford F-150 full-size pickup truck was at 85 percent, according to the study.

A trio of General Motors crossovers based on the same platform—the Chevy Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Buick Enclave—were rated 90 percent American-made.

The Tesla Model S garnered a 55-percent American-made rating, but the Model 3 could very well take the title of most American-made car, Electrek posits.

It all comes down to the batteries, the Tesla fan site suggests.

Tesla currently uses lithium-ion cells supplied by Panasonic, which manufactures them in Japan and elsewhere.

Cells for the Model 3 will be produced at the massive ""Gigafactory"" near Reno, Nevada, however, where elements of its powertrain will be made as well.

Tesla is also reportedly developing a source of lithium at a location near the Gigafactory, and Nevada officials are trying to incentivize lithium production in the state.

Raw materials sourced from the U.S. would likely boost the Model 3's American-made rating considerably.

Like the Model S and Model X, the Model 3 will be assembled at the Tesla plant in Fremont, California.

The battery pack and cells are a major component in any electric car.

One reason the Nissan Leafs built in Tennessee aren't all-American is that while their cells and battery packs are assembled in an adjacent plant, the high-value electrode material that goes into the cells is still fabricated in Japan and shipped to that factory in large rolls.

Could cells assembled in Nevada, using electrode material fabricated in the same plant, be enough to push the Model 3 past the two electric cars built in the same plant?

We may find out a year from now, when the Kogod School of Business publishes its 2017 American-made rankings.

Tesla reiterated this week that it expects to deliver the first Model 3 electric cars in July, and ramp up production to 5,000 units a week by the end of the year.

If it does, that should give the analysts enough to assess how American it actually is. (As will the domestic-content percentage on the Model 3 window sticker.)

Before Joining The Post + He Was The Technology Correspondent For National Journal + An Associate Editor At The Atlantic.,"Tesla is deliberately telling the public that one of its most anticipated vehicles isn't actually that great, after all.

Why? Because people keep mistakenly thinking that the Model 3 will actually outperform Tesla's older — but more luxurious — Model S, according to the company. In fact, the underlying technology will be much the same — and it's the Model S, which starts at $66,000, that will continue to be the company's top-of-the-line vehicle, with all the bells and whistles. The Model 3, which is expected to start at $35,000, was always meant to be a stripped down, cheaper version that's suitable for the masses.

“I thought we were being clever by calling it the Model 3. But actually the joke's on me, because there's this confusion,” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said in an earnings call Wednesday.

By calling it the Model 3, Musk said, some consumers have been accidentally misled into thinking that the number is a version number — similar to the way the iPhone 7 is considered ""better"" than the iPhone 6, the iPhone 5, and so on down the line.

In explaining the difference between a versioning system and a model system, Musk himself got quickly sidetracked.

“Model 3 is not version 3 of our car,” he said. “We're probably on version 4 of Model S. And Model 3 will also be version 4. … It's a little confusing. One is a letter, and the other is a number.”

It's unclear just how many consumers may have been confused, or perhaps put down a $1,000 reservation deposit for a Model 3 they thought would be as sophisticated as the Model S. A Tesla representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

In terms of actual differences, the Model 3 is smaller than the Model S. It lacks the large dashboard with instruments and buttons that should be familiar on more conventional cars. It is expected to weigh less, possibly enhancing handling at a slight cost to battery capacity or performance.

One possible source of the confusion could stem from Tesla's unconventional development strategy. According to Musk's decade-old master plan, Tesla's initial goal was to produce a very expensive sports car and then a slightly less expensive sedan, before finally turning to a low-cost mainstream electric vehicle. Because developing and refining technology is expensive, the idea was to churn out a few high-priced cars at first to help pay for the design of the cheaper, more ubiquitous ones.

But when it comes to other gadgets and gizmos, consumers have come to expect that the latest actually is the greatest. So Musk is being forced to do some customer education on the fly.

“Given you can’t actually build or configure a Model 3 yet, the confusion is somewhat understandable,” said Jeffrey Osborne, an industry analyst at Cowen & Co.

On Wednesday Tesla released its first-quarter earnings report, showing greater-than-expected losses but somewhat higher revenue, at $2.7 billion for the quarter. The company delivered more than 25,000 vehicles, posting a quarterly record, and said that production for the Model 3 is on track. It will be producing about five times more cars in 2018 than it does today, executives added, totaling 500,000 per year."

It’s revolutionized seemingly non-digital industries—think of how different financial services, for instance, are today from what they were two decades ago—and investors expect it to soon transform others, which is why Tesla Motors is worth more than General Motors despite making a tiny fraction as many cars as GM makes and earning a tiny fraction of the revenue.

This phenomenon explains why the so-called Big Five of the digital economy—Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook—have, at various points over the last year, been the five most valuable companies in the world.

So you might say that the digital economy has lived up to the expectations people had for it 20 years ago, in the early days of the Web. In other important ways, however, its consequences have been smaller than you might think. U.S. GDP growth has, by historical standards, been disappointingly slow since the arrival of the Internet. Productivity growth, which many assumed would be invigorated by the impact of digital technologies, has been dismal for much of this century. In the heyday of the Internet boom during the late 1990s, productivity growth accelerated for the first time since the 1970s, and it appeared for a short while as if technological innovation had solved a central problem with the U.S. economy. But the productivity boom ended in the early 2000s, and it never resumed. Some observers initially suspected mismeasurement, arguing that GDP was not capturing the true value of the many free goods the digital economy offers. But there’s little doubt that the productivity revolution we hoped digitization would usher in has yet to materialize.

The digital economy also has not transformed the job market as much as one might have expected. To be sure, we now have entirely new categories of workers: fleets of Uber drivers, and the TaskRabbiters who haunt Whole Foods stores in major cities. But Americans aren’t job-hopping more than they used to—in fact, by some measures they’re changing jobs less than at any point in the past two decades. And digitization has also eliminated swaths of workers—not just because of automation, but also because of things like online shopping, which has put hundreds of thousands of retail workers out of a job. More important, the digital economy has not been the source of a huge number of good, well-paying jobs. In fact, the rise and consolidation of the digital economy has coincided with an extraordinarily weak labor market. Wages for American workers have just recently started to grow at a clip faster than inflation, but for most of this century they’ve been close to stagnant. (The same is true in most developed countries.) That’s not the fault of digitization. But digitization has not been the driver of job and economic growth that many hoped it would be. Information and communication technologies—which include software and IT companies and Internet firms, along with entertainment and publishing—have seen their share of GDP rise just 1 percent since 2000. And while that’s almost certainly an understatement—and doesn’t capture the impact of digitization on other industries—the number is striking. So, too, is the fact that only a small percentage of private-sector workers work in what you would think of as digital companies.

Still, the most surprising—and potentially troubling—thing about today’s digital economy is how remarkably stable it has become. The buzzword that was always associated with digitization was “disruption.” The Internet and other digital technologies, it was assumed, would accelerate competitive pressures and make it harder for incumbents to hold onto power. If the old industrial order was characterized by companies that stayed at the top for decades, the digital economy, with its supposedly low barriers to entry and low switching costs, was going to be characterized by constant turnover at the top. Instead, the opposite is true. Today’s digital economy, at least on the consumer side, is dominated by the same five giants that have dominated it for at least the past decade and that almost everyone seems to anticipate will dominate it for the foreseeable future (at least if you go by their market capitalizations, which anticipate many more years of enormous profits for all of them). The digital economy is an economy in which platforms are the biggest source of value, and the Big Five’s platforms are the most lucrative ever invented. The result is that this economy is governed, in effect, by an oligopoly. The Big Five sometimes compete and sometimes coöperate, but ultimately each has solid control over its core markets.

“Oligopoly” sounds sinister, but this one was not primarily created by overtly anticompetitive or monopolistic behavior. Rather, digital markets are what economists call winner-take-all markets, in which success tends to breed nearly insuperable advantages. The rule that seems to govern today’s digital economy, in fact, was well stated in Matthew 13:12: “For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance.” Which is great for those who have, and not so great for everyone trying to compete with them.

Power of numbers

How did we end up with a digital economy dominated by a few big players? The simplest explanation focuses on what are called network effects, whereby a product or service becomes more valuable the more people use it. In the classic example of a network effect, a telephone is worthless if only one person has one, since there’s no one to call. If two people have telephones, they now have some value. And if a million people have telephones, the phone network suddenly becomes enormously valuable.

The implication is that the more users a network has, the easier it becomes to add more users. And direct network effects in this sense are important in understanding the success of a company like Facebook. Facebook’s single biggest advantage over any would-be competitors, at this point, is simply that it’s such an immense network that if you want to connect with people, it’s the logical place to start. The same is true of services like Instagram and China’s WeChat. For digital companies like Snap and Twitter, which are struggling to become profitable, direct network effects are just about the only value they have at all.

The Big Five also benefit from what are sometimes called indirect network effects, including the fact that sellers want to be where buyers are, and vice versa. Because Google has such an enormous user base, companies want to advertise with it. And that makes Google a natural place to go if you’re looking to buy something. Similarly, because Amazon has such a critical mass of customers, it’s the natural place for third-party sellers to gravitate. When Amazon made the decision to allow third-party sellers on its site, competing with its own wares, the decision seemed crazy to many at the time. But it positioned the company to benefit from the network effect: having third-party sellers made Amazon more appealing to customers, which in turn made it more appealing to sellers, creating a virtuous cycle for the company.

Beyond the network effects is another, related way that the sheer scale of the Big Five helps them stay on top: through the access they have to enormous amounts of user data. That data, which is far more detailed and granular than anything companies have been able to access in the past, helps these companies improve their products and services, which in turn helps them add more users, which gives them access to more data, and so on. This data flywheel effect did not get as much attention as network effects in the early days of the digital economy, but it’s become clear that user data is an enormous competitive advantage for the powerhouses of the digital economy and a key reason why it’s difficult to imagine them being toppled anytime soon. By tracking people’s clicks, Google is continually improving its search results and ad servicing. Amazon and Netflix and Apple mine their data to improve their recommendation algorithms, making it more likely they’ll offer you things you want to buy or watch. This process isn’t automatic—you need to have lots of smart data scientists and be willing to invest the resources to ceaselessly upgrade your product. But if you do that, and all of the Big Five do, the rewards can be immense—far greater than what comes merely from the traditional online business model of packaging data and selling it to advertisers.

The ability to gather enormous amounts of data and analyze it efficiently is also at least part of the reason investors think Tesla is more valuable than General Motors. After a traditional car company sells a car to a customer, its relationship with that customer typically is limited (except for maintenance and servicing). Tesla, by contrast, collects terabytes of driving data—including, in some cases, video data—from its customers. That data is then put to use in improving the self-driving features of its cars. According to Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Tesla cars are now logging five million miles a day. Since making self-driving cars work depends on machine learning, which in turn requires reams of the data that AI learns from, Tesla’s advantage in data is likely to translate into a huge advantage in making safe and effective self-driving cars. Indeed, Jonas has argued that Tesla’s new mass-market Model 3 sedan could be up to 10 times safer than the average car.

Finally, the Big Five have entrenched themselves in a more traditional fashion, by using their highly valued stock and their enormous amounts of cash to buy other companies, something they’ve done far more aggressively in recent years. Together, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have roughly a quarter of the cash reserves in the entire S&P 500. Google, the most active buyer, has averaged one acquisition a month. Acquisitions have become increasingly important as a way to gain new technology and new engineering talent, expand into new markets or new product areas, and in some cases squelch potential competition. And since no competitor has the resources to outbid the Big Five, it’s another way in which simply being big makes it easier to keep getting bigger.

Digital monopolies

So on the one hand, we have a digital economy that, for all the value it’s created, has not dramatically improved economic growth or wage growth for ordinary workers; on the other, a big chunk of that economy is dominated by a very small group of players. And what’s interesting is that there’s some reason to think these two things are, in fact, connected to each other.

To begin with, the most important fact about platform companies is that they scale, meaning that they can create enormous amounts of value while employing a relatively small number of workers. This is a good thing from the perspective of efficiency. But it also helps explain why today’s digital giants have a smaller impact on the economy than dominant companies had in the past. Together, the Big Five employ around 400,000 full-time workers in the United States. That might sound like a lot. But roughly half of those workers are Amazon employees, many in relatively low-skill, low-paying warehouse jobs. And it’s actually fewer employees than General Motors alone had in 1979, when the U.S. workforce was a lot smaller. What’s more, where GM’s production led to eight jobs in its supply chain for every one person it employed directly, the ripple effects of the Big Five’s businesses, with the exception of Apple, are much smaller. The result is that the rewards of the digital economy are more concentrated among a small number of workers than the rewards of the industrial economy were.

This is aggravated by the fact that the Silicon Valley dream of starting a company in your garage and making it into a huge business has become less realistic than ever. Even though billions continue to be poured into venture funding (more than $200 billion between 2011 and 2016), and even though the number of so-called high-growth startups has not declined in recent years, work by the MIT economists Scott Stern and Jorge Guzman shows that fewer of those startups are succeeding than did in the past. Of course, we still have the Teslas and Ubers (or Lyfts) of the world. But they are rarer than they once were. And one plausible reason is the sheer scale and scope of the Big Five, which can meet competitive challenges either by copying the innovations of others (as Facebook arguably did with Snapchat), and thereby making them seem superfluous, or simply by buying potential competitors at an early stage. Regardless of why it’s happening, though, the result is less dynamism in the economy, and less spreading of the wealth.

One obvious solution to the problems caused by the concentration of power in just a few companies is to break up the Big Five or regulate them as, in effect, public utilities. And of late, there have been more and more calls for dramatic action. But this is difficult for a variety of reasons. First, these companies don’t, for the most part, fit the stereotype of the monopolist. They aren’t “natural monopolies,” like power companies, in markets where it would be practically impossible for a competitor to arise. Anyone who wants to build a new search engine, or a new online retailer, can do so. These companies also, with some exceptions, didn’t achieve their dominance by engaging in conventionally anticompetitive behavior so much as they exploited the nature of the digital economy to build and maintain their empires.

Nor do you hear too many complaints from consumers, although issues of privacy obviously still matter. Indeed, relative to industries like cable television or airlines, digital companies tend to do well on customer satisfaction, and the digital economy as a whole has become a cornucopia of “free” stuff (paid for with consumers’ attention but not their cash). And even though, in practice, consumers often get locked in to the technologies these companies offer (if only because once your data is in the cloud, it’s so much easier to stay than leave), the businesses have no real leverage over consumers. Most also continue to pour billions of dollars into research and development, and they are constantly upgrading their products and services. So it’s hard to argue that these giants have been anything but beneficial to consumer welfare, which since the 1970s has been the standard that antitrust regulators apply.

Indeed, when we look at what the digital economy has done over the past two decades, what becomes clear is that it has created an enormous amount of value for consumers and for a small group of big companies, even as it has diminished competition, centralized power, and made life much more difficult for businesses that produce content or try to compete with the economy’s dominant players. (In one way or another, if you want to make money in the digital economy, you will almost certainly find yourself working with, rather than against, one of the Big Five.) In the industrial economy, the benefits were spread widely among companies, employees, and consumers.

According to an announcement by Brennan earlier this month, the $100 million deal adds 2.5 million square feet to Brennan's industrial portfolio in Chicago, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Birmingham, Grand Rapids, Jacksonville, and Minneapolis.

While the properties were not identified, several trade publications and property records have identified Tesla's tool and die facility at 5460 Executive Parkway SE as one of the properties.

Cascade Township property records confirmed the sale, showing the five-building parcel was sold for $9.5 million to SIP Grand Rapids LLC, which gave its address as the headquarters of Brennan Investment Group in Minnetonka, Minn.

Tesla Motors of Fremont, Calif. is listed as the property's tax payer.

Known for its electric cars and enigmatic founder Elon Musk, Tesla acquired the former Riviera Tool and Die Co. in 2015 as it began acquiring the tooling capacity it needed to build components for its Model X and Model 3 editions.

Tesla acquisition revives hope at West Michigan tool and die maker ""I think it speaks well of our own industry and supply chain,"" said Mike Wall, director of automotive analysis for IHS. ""I think it's very good news on the West Michigan front.""

The Aug. 31 sale was described as a joint venture by Brennan Investment Group and Arch Street Capital Advisors, LLC, a Greenwich, Conn.- based real estate investment advisory firm.

""This acquisition marks our sixth joint venture together and demonstrates the breadth and depth of our net lease platform. We have the ability to both acquire large portfolios as well as aggregate individual long-term net lease assets,"" said Michael Brennan, chairman of Brennan Investment Group in a Sept. 12 news release.

Although Tesla builds the tooling needed to manufacture its cars in Michigan, Tesla has not been allowed to use its direct sales model to sell vehicles in Michigan, where the law was changed to require that new cars be sold through dealership networks."

So having one of Musk's companies on your resume almost automatically makes it more impressive. Landing the gig doesn't come easy though. Even for interns, the work is tough and the days are long. But the pay is good: Tesla Motors interns make a median monthly pay of $4,480 and SpaceX interns make a median monthly pay of $4,080, according to jobs website Glassdoor. (Other Silicon Valley tech companies pay more. Facebook, for example, pays its interns an average of $8,000 per month.) Here are anonymous firsthand accounts of what it's like to be an intern at Tesla and SpaceX. The comments were submitted to Glassdoor and have been edited only for length and clarity.

Interning at Tesla: What's it like? ""Cult-ish"" ""Working at Tesla is a lot like drinking from a firehose of sorts; you will be pushed beyond your comfort zone, be given an immense amount of responsibility, and learn a ton in a very short amount of time. I would consider all of these 'pros' of working at the company, since these are the conditions under which I thrive the most. But, understandably, not everyone likes to be constantly under the pressure of unrealistic deadlines or working more hours than you would at most other companies. It is, though, a great place to grow in a very short amount of time, and it sure does look good on a resume. ""I am as big a Musk fanboy as anybody, but working at Tesla does sort of have a cult-ish feel to it. Everyone is a fanboy and Musk's word is law. ""For most people, the lower-than-average salary might not justify the immense workload."" — Electrical engineering intern in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Unrealistic deadlines"" ""Fast-paced, dynamic work environment with employees that are incredibly enthusiastic about what they do. Communication is key and they focus heavily on making sure everyone is on the same page so projects get completed efficiently and surpass expectations.

Morris,"Tesla Motors this week reported that first-quarter revenue had more than doubled year over year. During the subsequent earnings call, chief executive Elon Musk gave several insights into the company’s plans, including a general timeline for the Model Y, the company’s electric crossover sport utility vehicle. Musk says the vehicle will be crucial to meeting the company’s goal of delivering 1 million vehicles by 2020.

“I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019,” Musk said on the call. “And then I think that 1 million units is quite likely, combined, yeah. Maybe more.”

Musk also revealed that the Model Y will be based on a “different platform” than the $35,000 Model 3 sedan—something of a surprise, since most major automakers share parts between models to save on development and production costs.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

But Musk indicated that the new Model Y platform is itself a push for efficiency and aims to continue the company’s strategy of designing cars that are more simple to manufacture. As an example, Musk said that while the electrical system of the Model S included three kilometers (1.86 mi.) of wires, the Model 3 slashed that figure by half. The Model Y’s wiring harness will be only 100 meters (328 ft.) long, he added.

Thanks to that sort of streamlining, Musk said “there will be nothing close to” the manufacturing efficiency of the Model Y.

On the subject of the Model 3, Musk said the company was on track to begin production in July. Tesla plans to produce more than 5,000 cars a week by the end of 2017.

Musk also indicated that a Tesla pickup truck is well along the design pipeline. That model is “not going to be that widely separated in time” from the company’s electric semi truck, which is expected to be revealed in September."
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/business/a-fatality-forces-tesla-to-confront-its-limits.html,pos,0.9999103728879065,8.962711210976509e-05,A Fatality Forces Tesla to Confront Its Limits,2016-07-02 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:40:56.460500,Bill Vlasic,"DETROIT — As the co-founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors, the technology billionaire Elon Musk has consistently portrayed his company’s electric cars as cleaner, safer and more innovative than models made by other automakers.

His confidence in Tesla’s technology has seemed boundless, particularly when the company announced last year that it would equip its flagship Model S sedans with a self-driving feature called Autopilot that was still in its testing phase. The technology was so out in front of federal highway regulations that there were no rules against it.

But with the revelation this week that a Model S driver in Florida was killed in May while operating his car in self-driving mode, Mr. Musk’s determination to push limits has hit its most formidable roadblock.

The question now is how much longer Mr. Musk and Tesla can continue to defy auto industry convention in trying to stay so far ahead of the competition. A major point of contention is the Autopilot feature and the decision to make it available to car owners while it was in “beta test” mode — a term typically applied to software that a company releases on an experimental basis."
https://www.wired.com/2017/06/elon-musk-tesla-semi-truck-battery/,pos,1.0,7.427488335707208e-14,Even Elon Musk May Not Be Able to Make an Electric Truck Work,2017-06-01 12:30:19,2019-06-24 14:40:58.116542,Eric Adams + Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"It's been nearly a year since Elon Musk revealed his intention to electrify the world's roads with buses and trucks in addition to Tesla's passenger cars. He hasn't said much about the 18-wheeler—a proper unveil is set for September—except that it will use same motors as the upcoming Model 3, and that it would, of course, disrupt an industry that generates one quarter of US transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.

If anyone deserves the benefit of the doubt, it's Musk. But unless he has a radical bit of battery technology squirreled away, even he may not be able to deliver a long-haul truck capable of displacing the diesel burners roaming America's highways. That's the key finding of a paper by a pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers, who found a battery-powered semi would be limited to a 300-mile range, cost a fortune, and offer limited cargo capacities because of the weight and volume of the technology required to keep it moving down the road.

“The challenge is on par in difficulty level with electric airplanes,” said Venkat Viswanathan, who conducted the research with colleague Shashank Sripad. The peer-reviewed study, previewed to Wired, will be published in the American Chemical Society's ACS Energy Letters within a few weeks.

The researchers considered data on average loads carried by trucks, average distances traveled, and a slew of specific trucking-related physical parameters, such as drag coefficients, rolling resistance, air density, and overall powertrain efficiency. The kind of full-size tractor trailers Musk wants to make cover, on average, 300 to 600 miles a day.

Say the Tesla truck runs a lithium-ion battery system that generates 243 watt-hours per kilogram at the cell-level—a good bet based on the tech in Tesla’s current cars. To cover 600 miles without stopping to charge, the truck would need a 14 ton battery. A 900-mile battery would weigh about 22 tons. Based on current prices, those packs would cost between $290,000 and $450,000. A comparable diesel rig costs about $120,000, all-in.

Price isn't the only question: Federal rules limit trucks' gross weight to 40 tons. Considering the heft of the battery pack, plus things like the cab, trailer, and wheels, the researchers figure a 600-mile-ready Tesla truck could carry just nine tons of cargo. That's two-thirds the current average payload of 16 tons. Even the lower operating costs and fuel savings of electric propulsion may not balance out such a disadvantage in an industry where efficiency rules. Meanwhile, the time it would take to top off massive batteries would slow things down considerably, although charge time could correspond with the mandatory breaks long-haul truckers must take.

“Our paper suggests that using a bigger battery pack to achieve longer range maximum payload is unfeasible, given the energy density of current lithium-ion batteries,” Viswanathan says. “Three hundred to 350 miles is probably what the vehicle could be designed for. Beyond that, the battery would be both very heavy and very expensive.”

Granted, that kind of range works for short, repetitive routes—say shuttling between ports and distribution centers—where air pollution in populated areas is especially worrisome. Even Toyota is working on a zero-emissions, 200-mile-range hydrogen truck for that use case. But Musk doesn't do restraint—he's targeting the semis that criss-cross the country.

Tesla officials declined to divulge more details of their program. And of course it is possible that Tesla engineers have figured out a way of making this work because Musk is Musk and seems to thrive on proving people wrong. Viswanathan estimates a next-generation “beyond lithium-ion battery pack” could provide a 600-mile range and cost about $180,000. Such technology could allow payload capacities of 20, 16, and 12 tons for 300, 600, and 900 mile ranges, respectively. (He concedes that it’s still unclear what benefits in cost might come from Tesla’s increased production at its lithium-ion gigafactory in Nevada.)

The question, then, is whether Musk has enough rabbits left in that hat of his to pull this one off, too."

The Palo Alto-based automaker filed a lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan Southern Division. The lawsuit comes just a week after Michigan officials rejected Tesla’s request for a“Class A” license, which would have allowed the automaker to open a company-owned dealership in the state. Tesla applied for the license to test the limits of a state law that prevents it from selling vehicles there directly to consumers, the company said back in February.

Tesla (tsla) has a different business model than other automakers. It sells its own cars directly online and through its own branded stores, not through franchised dealerships. All U.S. states have laws that prevent automakers with existing franchisees from opening their own dealerships to compete with them. However, dealer associations in a number of U.S. states, including have tried to expand the law to include manufacturers like Tesla that don’t have franchise dealers. Tesla has not been able to get a license to sell directly to consumers in Michigan, Texas, Connecticut, and Utah.

In October 2014, Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill initiated and backed by the Michigan Automobile Dealers Association that effectively banned Tesla from selling directly to consumers in the state.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily technology newsletter.

Tesla says the law was passed to give give local auto dealers a state-sponsored monopoly on car sales in Michigan. “As a result of this law, Michigan consumers are forced to accept reduced access to the products they want, less competition and higher prices,” Tesla said in an emailed statement.

Tesla insists that it prefers to solve the problem legislatively, but says the response from the state legislature has forced the company to take legal action.

Again, from Tesla:

Unfortunately, the local auto dealers and local manufacturers have made clear that they oppose any law that would allow Tesla to operate in Michigan. Given their position, the leadership of the Michigan legislature recently informed Tesla that it will not even hold a hearing to debate the issue. As one leading legislator told Tesla: The local auto dealers do not want you here. The local manufacturers do not want you here. So you’re not going to be here.

In the lawsuit, Tesla accuses General Motors (gm) of using its considerable influence in the state to help push the so-called Anti-Tesla bill through the legislature.

A spokesman at Gov. Snyder’s office said in an email the state doesn’t comment on pending lawsuits.

Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Consumer Reports recently brought out its yearly Owner Satisfaction Survey, and Tesla finished number one, with a whopping 91% of owners saying they'd buy a Tesla vehicle if they had it to do all over again.

That's an astounding figure in a highly competitive industry. It's like a Major League Baseball player batting .900.

In practice, it means that Tesla owners are impossible to ""conquest,"" or woo to other brands, a situation that all the automakers aiming to take on Tesla in the future should take into account as they spend billions developing electric vehicles.

There could also soon be many more Tesla lovers in the world: the automaker expects to launch it Model 3 mass-market vehicle in late 2017. It will sell for $35,000 — and there are 373,000 preorders.

So why do Tesla owners love their vehicles so much?

Teslas take their cues from consumer technology, not from auto-industry traditions

Cars have been rolling computers for some time now, but the way in which those computers were updated — if they ever were — was extremely old-school. Owners brought the car back to the dealership, and the maintenance guys updated the software or hardware.

This could take all day. Or several days. Or be impossible if the hardware or software could no longer be updated.

Contrast this with Tesla. The carmaker routinely updates software over-the-air. This happens overnight and owners don't need to do anything. The practice has enabled Tesla to abandon model years — there's no such thing as a 2014 Model S or a 2016 Model X — because OTA updates mean you can get a technologically new car in just 24 hours.

True, the hardware isn't new, and for that to be refreshed you have to visit a Tesla service center. But the car's ""brain"" has been made better.

Tesla is following the consumer-electronics industry here. Your iPhone and apps are frequently improved and updated on the software side.

Teslas actually do have the potential to save the planet

There's no debate: powering a car with electrons is superior to powering it with gasoline. The problem for electric cars has always been that gas is a much more efficient fuel source: massive energy content, relatively cheap, easy to store and move around. The average internal-combustion engine is also good for 300-400 miles per tank, while 200-plus-mile-range EVs are just starting to arrive at prices that the mass market can handle.

One caveat here: the electricity that powers Teslas comes mostly from burning coal and natural gas. But it doesn't have to. It could come from sustainable sources or from nuclear power. And in that case Tesla's would still generate zero tailpipe emissions.

As energy sources become cleaner in the future, Tesla's will already be doing their part to reduce the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. So if you're passionate about this environmental issue, then buying a Tesla is a satisfying decision.

Tesla's brand is highly symbolic

This is after all the first successful new American car company to come along in decades, and the first all-electric automaker ever. The brands is, in a word, incredible. It's the envy of the auto industry.

If you want proof about how much pent-up love is out there for Tesla, look no further than the 373,000 preorders that rolled in for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, revealed this past March. It was an unprecedented event — a huge number of customers putting down $1,000 each for a vehicle that wouldn't be built for almost two years.

These people weren't promising to buy a car — they were investing in a brand, and in Elon Musk's ability to execute. In effect, they were spending $1,000 each to join a club. In the past, it's cost on average $100,000 to get past the Tesla velvet rope. But not anymore.

Tesla's are pretty great cars

Don't believe me — check with Consumer Reports. When CR tested an up-level trim of the Model S, the publication said that the vehicle broke its scale. It had never evaluated a better car.

Teslas are terrifically versatile and fun-to-drive vehicles. I've driven them all, from the original Roadster to the Model X SUV, and I got a joyride in the Model 3 prototype early this year. They're fast, comfortable, and technologically advanced.

The massive center touchscreen is the wave of the future as far as controlling infotainment and vehicle systems is concerned, and Autopilot sets the bar for semi-autonomous systems.

The design of the vehicles is durable, in the sense that a Tesla won't look dated in 5-7 years, which is the typical cycle for most other vehicles. The fit and finish isn't excessively luxurious, but it is well done and it appeals to a Silicon Valley minimalist mindset.

For road trips, the Model S can tote as much gear as an SUV and it's whisper quiet during freeway cruising. What's more, the Supercharger network is now well-established in the US, so longer trips aren't an issue, and Tesla has partnered with other charging systems to fill in any gaps.

Tesla doesn't just make great cars, though, they also provide a great ownership experience (which includes invites to Tesla's awesome parties, for what it's worth).

The best brands are built with love in mind. And obviously, Tesla is feeling plenty of love."

A short summary: The Model S is an electric car starting around $70,000. The Model 3 is a slightly smaller electric car that starts around $35,000.

CEO Elon Musk said this year that some consumers have been confused about the differences between the two vehicles.

“We anti-sell the Model 3,” Musk told investors in May. “But our net reservations continue to climb week after week. No advertising, anti-selling, nothing to test drive, still grows every week.”

Analysts question whether Model 3 reservations — announced at nearly 400,000 shortly after its launch last year — will cannibalize Model S sales. Musk has refused to update Model 3 reservation numbers.

For the tale of the tape, the pricier Model S checks out a foot longer than the Model 3, has more than twice the cargo space, and carries as many as five adults and two children versus the five adults in the less-pricey sedan.

Model S buyers also get two video screens, additional custom settings, range of between 249 and 335 miles and a Ludicrous mode that accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in as fast as 2.3 seconds.

The basic Model 3 comes with a smaller battery pack, a full-charge range starting at 215 miles and starting line acceleration to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds.

“We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version 3 of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,” Musk told investors. “Actually Model S will be better than Model 3, as it should be, because it’s a more expensive car.”

The company delivered a record 76,230 vehicles last year, and led the U.S. market for large luxury sedans.

Analysts at Baird Equity Research said this week they expect Tesla to have an easier time selling the Model 3 than previous vehicles. The company “is now a household name, which should lead to increased consumer demand for the Model 3, Model Y” and other Tesla products, the analysts wrote.

The Model 3 is slated to go into production in July and the first deliveries are expected in the next several months. Fans have spotted prototypes of the sedan near Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters and the SpaceX offices in southern California."

Shares of electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 17.5% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's rise helped it recover some of its pullback earlier in the year.

So what

There's no surefire reason for Tesla's 17.5% gain during the month, but one did stand out as the most likely catalyst for at least a portion of the gain.

Tesla stock had pulled back in the weeks following the U.S. presidential election, perhaps because investors were concerned about how Tesla could be impacted during Trump's time as president. Trump has expressed disbelief about global warming and outlined actions for eliminating some government spending related to climate change. But sentiment about how Tesla might fare with Trump as president turned rosier when the president-elect started cozying up to Elon Musk. Trump invited the Tesla CEO to his tech summit meeting in New York City, and even appointed him to his Strategic and Policy Forum.

So, Tesla stock may have simply rebounded in December from a sell-off spurred by an overreaction to Trump's election. Of course, there were probably other factors driving the rebound, such as the S&P 500's overall 2% gain during this period, but Trump's warming up to Musk was likely one of the main catalysts for Tesla stock during the month.

Now what

Investors shouldn't read too much into month-to-month moves like this, but it is notable to see Trump keeping Musk close to his side. Still, investors may want to keep an eye on any political action during Trump's presidency that could impact Tesla."

The agreement, a non-binding letter of intent, is contingent on shareholder approval of Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity Corp, the electric car maker said in a statement issued late on Sunday. Financial terms were not disclosed, but officials in New York said production would take place at a factory SolarCity is building in Buffalo.

Panasonic is expected to begin production at the Buffalo facility in 2017 and Tesla intends to provide a long-term purchase commitment for those cells.

Tesla said it will use the cells and modules in a solar energy system that will work seamlessly with its energy storage products Powerwall and Powerpack.

Tesla is acquiring SolarCity, in which Musk is also a large shareholder and is run by his first cousins, as part of a strategy to build a clean-energy consumer brand.

Last year, SolarCity said it would manufacture a new kind of solar panel at the plant that would be the most efficient yet at transforming sunlight into electricity.

SolarCity has pledged to spend $5 billion over 10 years on its RiverBend factory in New York in return for $750 million in tax breaks and other investments by the state. The state funding is part of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s pledge to spend $1 billion on economic development in the Buffalo region.

A Panasonic spokeswoman in Japan declined to offer details on the collaboration. SolarCity and Tesla did not immediately respond to queries sent to a SolarCity spokeswoman who said she could direct questions to both companies.

Panasonic is already working with the U.S. automaker to supply batteries for the Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market car.

Tesla and SolarCity Corp shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposed merger on Nov. 17, and the automaker said it would provide plans for the combined company ahead of the vote."

The electric carmaker also signaled it has substantially reduced the costs for launching production of its high volume Model 3 sedan next year. Musk told analysts the company’s current plan “does not require any capital raise for the Model 3 at all.”

The tech billionaire said Tesla could still raise capital to “account for uncertainty ... and de-risk the business,” however.

The third quarter profit and a leaner capital spending plan could help grease the wheels for Musk if he does seek to tap the markets for cash. Turning a profit, even for one quarter, should help counter skeptics who have questioned his ambitious plans for combining Tesla and solar panel maker SolarCity SCTY.O into a company offering roof-to-garage no-carbon energy systems.

Musk has made promises to investors before related to the timing of product launches, production and profitability, only to walk them back.

The company has weathered a difficult few months, beginning with the death of a Model S driver using Autopilot, Tesla’s much vaunted semi-autonomous driving system, and culminating in the decision to acquire debt-laden SolarCity, which has increased scrutiny on the finances of both Tesla and SolarCity.

Earlier this month, Tesla told investors it expected to raise capital this year to fund the Model 3 launch, which will involve a substantial investment in machinery and product development. But Musk signaled in a tweet earlier this month that was no longer the case.

Tesla reiterated that the mass-market Model 3 sedan was on track for deliveries in the second half of 2017. The Model 3 has a starting price of $35,000, about half the price of the current Model S sedan.

In the short term, Musk said sales of a new 100 kilowatt-hour version of the Model S, which starts at $134,500 and can travel 315 miles (507 km) on a charge, will be key to profitability.

Tesla said it planned capital spending of $1.8 billion for the year, with just over $1 billion of those outlays coming in the fourth quarter. However, that new total capital spending forecast for this year is about 20 percent lower than the automaker’s previous forecast of $2.25 billion.

Tesla’s results were lifted by $139 million in sales of California zero emission vehicle credits. Rival automakers can buy the credits rather than sell electric cars of their own. That was comparable to what the company booked from sales of so-called ZEV credits for all of 2014, said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne.

“Certainly what drove the upside on profit is the $139 million of those zero emission credits which is a near 100 percent profit business,” said Osborne.

Tesla said it had $3.08 billion in cash and cash-equivalents as of Sept. 30, compared with $3.25 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Tesla’s planned acquisition of SolarCity will be neutral, or a cash contributor to fourth-quarter Tesla results in “a small way,” Musk said.

The automaker’s shares initially rose 6.2 percent in after-hours trade but gave back some of those gains and were trading at about $211 a share, up 4 percent from the closing price of $202.24.

Tesla recorded net income of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, marking the first positive earnings since the first quarter of 2013. That compared with a loss of $229.9 million, or $1.78 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue more than doubled to $2.30 billion.

Tesla is one of them.

No company has built a business more singularly around the goal of sustainability than Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors (tsla). That was true during the decade he’s spent promoting the development of commercially viable electric cars, with a goal of bringing them to the mass market. And it’s even more so now, with Tesla’s recently completed acquisition of SolarCity (scty), the solar-panel company run by his cousin, where Musk is the largest shareholder. Among the companies’ aims: To develop batteries for storing solar-generated power, solving a problem that has dogged clean-energy advocates.

Much remains to be done, starting with generating profits. While building gorgeous luxury cars, Tesla’s also faced safety concerns and struggled to meet production goals, even before confronting its promised five-fold leap to 500,000 cars a year in 2018, with the forthcoming introduction of its $35,000 Model 3 sedan. Yet Tesla’s offered proof that the automotive future doesn’t need to run on gasoline, and taken real steps to turn that vision into reality. Far-bigger rivals are now rushing to follow.

It's Bunk.,2017-06-22 04:25:23,2019-06-24 14:41:16.149607,Ezra Dyer,"If you're predisposed to hate electric cars, then there's a wonderful story making the rounds that'll support your worldview. It claims that the production of Tesla battery produces carbon emissions equivalent to driving an internal-combustion vehicle for eight years—8.2, to be precise.

That's a sensational claim, one that's been seized upon by EV haters and gleefully postedby climate change-denying blogs and sites that despise electric cars. Just one problem: It's absolute nonsense.

The headline is based on a Swedish study. It posits that production of a 100 kWh battery—Tesla's biggest—produces 17.5 tons of carbon dioxide. We'll take that at face value so we can dig into it here. The question then becomes how far you'd have to drive an internal-combustion vehicle to emit that much carbon.

The study's finding of 8.2 years is ""based on a series of assumptions."" To get to that figure, two of those assumptions must have been that the internal-combustion vehicle in question gets great mileage and isn't driven very much. Oh, and while battery production incurs a carbon footprint in these statistics, the gasoline in the study magically appears in your tank and the only carbon emitted is from burning it (that is, the calculations ignore the carbon emissions created by producing and moving large quantities of gasoline). Those are nifty assumptions.

Let's say the gas-powered car is actually something similar to a Tesla Model S P100D, which would use the battery in question. Let's say we're talking about the Audi A8 4.0, another quick AWD sedan. According to the EPA, that car emits 6.2 metric tons of CO2 per year, given 15,000 miles of annual driving. And since A8s don't automatically percolate their own 93-octane, the EPA also calculates an additional 1.1 tons of upstream carbon to get those ancient dinosaur innards coursing through your fuel pump. Math aficionados will note that 17.5 (battery production) divided by 7.3 (total annual A8 emissions) equals 2.4. As in, apples to apples, the battery's carbon footprint is zeroed out in less than three years.

There's also the fact that you can power your Tesla with rooftop solar, and repurpose former car batteries for home power storage, as BMW's already doing. Basically, this eight years thing is bupkis—one more example of nonsense people love to share on Facebook.

Look, there are plenty of valid reasons to prefer internal combustion engines—quick refueling, great infrastructure, the sound of a Shelby GT350R at redline. But environmental superiority isn't one of them."

The most recent crash involved a Tesla X driver who activated the vehicle’s Autopilot Assist feature at the start of a trip from Seattle to West Yellowstone, Mont. over the weekend. When the driver was near Whitehall, Mont. early Sunday, the car veered off of the road to the right and hit a guardrail, the Detroit Free Press reported. Neither the driver nor his passenger were injured.

It’s unclear whether the crash was caused by Tesla’s autopilot function, though a user on Tesla Motors Club, an online forum claiming to be a friend of the driver who crashed, said that the car’s auto-steering played a role.

According to the user, autopilot failed to detect debris, a wooden stake, in the road. At the time, the car was running at 60 miles per hour in a 55 mile zone.

Fortune has reached out to the user, and will update this story if we hear back.

Tesla though, denies that the crash was caused by a failure of the autopilot systems.

“The data suggests that the driver’s hands were not on the steering wheel, as no force was detected on the steering wheel for over 2 minutes after auto-steer was engaged (even a very small amount of force, such as one hand resting on the wheel, will be detected),” a Tesla spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fortune. “As road conditions became increasingly uncertain, the vehicle again alerted the driver to put his hands on the wheel. He did not do so and shortly thereafter the vehicle collided with a post on the edge of the roadway.”

Tesla is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, after Fortune noted the company, headed by Elon Musk, may have violated securities law when it did not disclose that a driver had died in May while using the car manufacturer’s autopilot feature, until after Tesla had sold $2 billion worth of shares in a secondary offering.

Additionally, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking data logs from all crashes that could be linked to autopilot, as part of a formal defect investigation.

Despite the deluge of scrutiny, Musk is standing by the technology. The CEO is focusing on educating its customers about autopilot."

The automaker said that it had patched the bugs in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday, a day after cyber-security researchers with China’a Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) disclosed their findings on their blog.

Interest in car hacking has surged since Fiat Chrysler last year recalled 1.4 million U.S. vehicles to fix onboard software bugs uncovered by two researchers. They demonstrated that they were able to gain remote control of a Jeep traveling at high speeds in a dramatic video posted on Wired.com.

Tesla said it was able to remedy the bugs uncovered by Tencent using an over-the-air fix to its vehicles, which saved customers the trouble of visiting dealers to obtain the update.

Tencent’s Keen Security Lab said on its blog that its researchers were able to remotely control some systems on the Tesla S in both driving and parking modes by exploiting the security bugs that were fixed by the automaker.

The blog said that Tencent believed its researchers were the first to gain remote control of a Tesla vehicle by hacking into an onboard computer system known as a CAN bus.

In a demonstration video, Tencent researchers remotely engaged the brake on a moving Tesla S, turned on its windshield wipers and opened the trunk.

“We have verified the attack vector on multiple varieties of Tesla Model S,” the blog said. “It is reasonable to assume that other Tesla models are affected.”

Tesla said it pushed out an over-the-air update to automatically update software on its vehicles within 10 days of learning about the bugs.

“Our realistic estimate is that the risk to our customers was very low, but this did not stop us from responding quickly,” the statement said.

It said the attack could only be triggered when a Tesla web browser was in use and the vehicle was close enough to a malicious WiFi hot spot to connect to it."

Rolex, Tesla, Lovesac among 11 new stores to open at Somerset mall A number of prominent retail brands are planning to open up shop in a major high-end Michigan mall within the next year.

Galleries provide customers with services and educational displays to explore and learn more about Tesla vehicles, and the company aims to respond to consumer demands from Michigan through its new space.

""We are excited to expand our presence in Michigan in order to educate consumers about the benefits of Tesla's vehicles and sustainable energy products in a fun and engaging environment,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement.

""Tesla's new gallery at the Somerset Mall allows anyone interested in Tesla, including the thousands of Model 3 reservation holders in Michigan, to learn about our technology, energy products and cars, including the fastest accelerating and safest production sedan and SUV that have ever been built.""

The new gallery will replace the in-store gallery at Nordstrom.

However, Michigan law prohibits direct sales of Tesla vehicles to customers that would bypass dealerships, which is why the company operates galleries, to help inform interested consumers who want to purchase a vehicle outside of the state.

He doesn’t call it that, of course. He gave it the far more benign name Master Plan, Part Deux.

Beyond creating a vertically integrated company that builds electric vehicles, batteries to store the power to propel them, and the solar panels to generate that power, he wants to create whole new vehicle lineups. Some of them sound like they’re in advanced stages of development.

The plan, which Musk posted to the Tesla Motors blog on Wednesday afternoon, comes a decade after Part One, which essentially laid out the company's plan to make boatloads of money with the Model S so it could produce the more affordable Model 3. Having crossed those things off his to-do list—while also outfitting an automobile factory, a battery factory, and, oh, running SpaceX and Solar City—Musk has moved on to the second phase of his plan.

Even as the company scrambles to produce the Model 3 sedan that Musk remains convinced will bring EVs to the masses, Tesla Motors, according to the Master Plan, Part Deux, sees itself creating a compact SUV and ""a new kind of pickup truck."" Beyond that, Musk says, ""there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.""

He means big-rigs and buses, and says both are the early stages of development—and could be revealed next year. ""We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.""

Now, electric buses are nothing new. San Francisco is crawling with them. But a Tesla bus? You know it would be gorgeous. Musk says they'd be smaller than you're used to, but offer plenty of room for wheelchairs, strollers, and bikes. They'll be quick enough to keep up with traffic, and deliver a smooooth ride.

Where things get really wild, though, is his claim that Tesla buses would not have to stick to pre-determined routes like the busses that rumble past your office. A little intelligent planning with smartphones and mapping (think = Uber Pool) can deliver people right to their door. He's even put some thought into what people without smartphones will do. They can use fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops, which will otherwise be redundant.

Looking a little further into the future, Tesla will continue developing its autonomous technology so all of these cars and trucks and buses do the driving. And then come the autonomous ride-sharing services in which Telsa owners let strangers borrow their cars or Tesla operates urban fleets ""ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.""

Individually, none of these ideas is at all radical. You'd be hard-pressed to find an automaker that isn't following Google in the race to autonomous cars, Daimler recently unveiled an autonomous big-rig, and a Tesla co-founder has developed a pretty sweet electric garbage truck. What is staggering here is the scale. Musk wants to do it all, immediately, and tie it all together in a cohesive system.

It's so crazy it's brilliant. And if Musk's record so far is any indication, don't bet against him pulling it off."

Thomson Reuters BENGALURU — Tesla Motors has raised $1.46 billion in fresh capital from the sale of its 6.8 million new common stock offering, according to IFR.

Tesla seeks to finance a plan to expand production of its electric vehicles to 500,000 a year by 2018.

The shares were priced at $215 by the lead managers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, IFR said.

The pricing is lower than its previous sale price of $242 in August and below a year high of $286.65 hit in July.

The Palo Alto, California-based carmaker said on Wednesday that it planned to sell up to $1.7 billion in new shares to fund its operations, and it said CEO Elon Musk would sell 2.8 million of his own shares, mainly to pay taxes related to exercising vested stock options.

Tesla's stock ended up 1.9% at $215.21 on Thursday, despite the announced plan to sell more stock at a price below previous share sale levels.

Tesla shares are down 10.3% this year.

The proceeds from the latest stock offering will be used mainly to pay for $2.25 billion in capital investments Musk has said will be needed this year to prepare for high-volume production of the Model 3. As of March 31, Tesla had $1.44 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

The company reported a net loss of $282.3 million for the first quarter, and it said in its prospectus that it must ""deliver significant cost reductions"" to avoid future losses.

Tesla previously has raised more than $4.5 billion in debt and equity offerings over the past six years. Since it raised $226 million in an initial public offering in June 2010, Tesla has gone back to the capital markets several times.

Tesla said it had 373,000 reservations from customers wanting the Model 3 sedan, which will be a smaller, less expensive companion to the current Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle.

In the past three months, Tesla (TSLA.O) has told suppliers the company was doubling its original production projections to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017 and 400,000 in 2018, several supplier industry executives familiar with the plans told Reuters.

Details on Model 3 production projections have not been reported previously, and Tesla did not break out target volumes for the Model 3.

Tesla has taken 373,000 orders for the Model 3 - which has a starting price of $35,000, about half its Model S - and has said it would begin customer deliveries in late 2017. But it has made no promises, and, on earlier models, customers waited months for delivery.

Citing “tremendous demand,” Chief Executive Elon Musk told analysts on an April call that the company planned to boost total production, including the existing Model S and Model X crossover, to 500,000 in 2018 - two years earlier than its original target and a 10-fold increase over the 50,000 vehicles it made in 2015.

Musk said Tesla told suppliers to prepare for Model 3 production tests in July 2017, a goal he acknowledged may be unrealistic for some. But he said the “aggressive” target was necessary to reach production goals.

“Now, will we actually be able to achieve volume production on July 1 next year? Of course not,” he told analysts.

“The reason is that even if 99 percent of the internally produced items and supplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car because you cannot produce a car that is missing 1 percent of its components,” he said.

Musk said the Model 3’s simpler design, new production hires and enthusiastic suppliers would help the company make its goals. He said Tesla would drop suppliers that could not meet deadlines and would bring more parts production in-house than traditional automakers typically do. He did not specify how much or which parts.

“It’s very important for us to have the ability to produce almost any part on the car at will because it alleviates risk with suppliers,” Musk told analysts.

Industry experts said Tesla’s new goals were extraordinary and raised doubts it could meet them. The handful of North American auto plants capable of building 500,000 vehicles a year are all run by automakers with decades of experience, they said.

Tesla continues to have delivery delays for its Model X SUV. Its Model S also missed delivery targets when launched.

SPEEDING UP ASSEMBLY

One complication is that Tesla has not finalized the Model 3 design and specifications, said automaking consultants and supply executives who asked not to be identified because Tesla prohibits them from disclosing contract details.

Musk has said the Model 3 design and engineering would be complete in June, 13 months ahead of the planned production startup.

Under ideal conditions, automakers have launched new assembly lines in 18 months, but they typically take two to three years after the first tooling and supply contracts are signed, several manufacturing consultants said.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N), for example, is converting a Sterling Heights, Michigan sedan plant to make 300,000 Ram 1500 pickups a year, a 50 percent increase in capacity.

“FCA already has the talent and the money, and the underlying machinery is already installed in the plant,” said one longtime supply sales executive. “They’re aiming to be up and running in 2018, so they have two years – and suppliers are wondering if they’ll make that deadline.”

Tesla says the Model 3 features 6,000 to 7,000 unique components, fewer than the typical automobile with a combustion engine and the Model S, which has more than 8,000 parts.

The company still is soliciting bids for parts and machinery, according to representatives from several of companies that have received them, as well as industry consultants who monitor such bids.

Automaking consultant Ron Harbour of Oliver Wyman said increasing production at the Fremont plant to 500,000 vehicles in 2018 would require more stamping, welding and assembly machinery that “could take up to 18 months to order and install.”

He said Musk’s plan to make parts in-house can minimize risk, but it also can be more expensive and distracting.

Tesla’s production push comes at a time of high demand for machinery and tooling created by a surge in product launches coming from established automakers, said a Detroit-based supplier sales executive.

Jeff Schuster of industry forecaster LMC Automotive said the goals were “implausible,” in part because Tesla’s battery factory in Reno, Nevada, was unfinished.

Aluminum, lithium and other materials - already in short supply - “could be another limiting factor,” said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions.

Earlier this month two top manufacturing executives left the company. Last week, Tesla said it had hired Peter Hochholdinger, formerly of Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand, as vice president of vehicle production.

Tesla may pay a premium for work to speed up the Model 3 production launch, supplier executives said. The company has increased its 2016 capital spending forecast by 50 percent to about $2.25 billion.

On Wednesday, Tesla announced it would sell up to $1.7 billion in new common shares, in part to pay for machinery and engineering for the Model 3.

“I’d be really surprised if he can launch production by next July,” said Frank Faga, a Detroit-based auto manufacturing consultant. “But this is a guy who says he’s going to Mars. Who am I to say he can’t do this?”"

The Ferrari LaFerrari, for example, reaches 70 mph a tenth of a second quicker, while the Porche 918 and McLaren P1 win out at 80 mph.

The S P100D's ludicrous speed comes at a cost -- and I don't mean the $134,500 and up price tag. It accelerates ""like a real jerk,"" according to Motor Trend. In physics terms, jerk refers to the rate of change of acceleration. Using the magazine's example, it's the difference between being pushed by a clumsy person and being aggressively shoved.

""Launching a Model S P100D (weighing 5,062 with gear and driver) in full-on Ludicrous Easter-egg mode snaps your body in a manner that is utterly impossible to replicate in any other street-legal production car on normal tires and dry asphalt at a mid-$100,000 price point,"" Motor Trend said.

Apparently, the Model S P100D's test performance beat Tesla Chairman and CEO Elon Musk's expectations. He told Twitter followers last November the software update would only shave 0.1 seconds off its acceleration time. After seeing today's results, however, Musk claimed the S P100D can perform even better if you remove the floor mats and front trunk liner."

The new track test time, via Electrek, also included a 10.5 second quarter-mile, both of which represent new records in terms of measured sprints. The Model S P100D becomes the first production car Motor Trend has ever test that has achieved a 0 to 60 mph speed meter than 2.3 seconds, in fact.

That’s much faster than the originally promised 2.5 second 0 to 60 mph time that the new Ludicrous+ mode (an Easter Egg that owners of the top-specced Teslas can unlock with a recent software update), and faster even than the 2.389 second time recorded by the fan-run Tesla Racing Channel in January.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk did say he though that a 2.3-second time was possible under Motor Trend’s testing conditions on Twitter previously, and this proves that it wasn’t only possible, but was also actually an underestimation of what the car could do. As Elektrek notes, the vehicle does have lighter Arachnid wheels, which may have helped, but they hardly qualify as an aftermarket upgrade since they’re part of the company’s referral program for rewarding Tesla owners who spread the love."

This latest test by Motor Trend pushed the Tesla ahead of the 2017 911 Turbo S, which was previously the quickest according to tests conducted by the magazine in November 2016. It also puts the Model S P100, which has a base price of $135,700, ahead of the Ferrari LaFerrari, McLaren P1, and Porsche 918 Spyder, which have base prices of $1.5 million, $1.5 million and $845,000 respectively.

Operating in Tesla’s Ludicrous Easter Egg mode, the Model S accelerated from 0 to 30 mph 0.05 seconds faster than the 911 Turbo S, the magazine says in its review. The two vehicles even out as the acceleration continues, with the Tesla edging ahead by 0.2 seconds as the cars move from 60 mph through to 90 mph. The two cross the quarter-mile mark together at 10.5 seconds, according to Motor Trend.

Elon Musk Thinks It’s a Good Thing He’s Advising President Trump

Tesla (tsla) CEO Elon Musk tweeted in November that an Easter egg released in a software update would allow the Model S P100D to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The Motor Trend testing shows the electric vehicle is even faster than promised.

As Motor Trend describes it in their review:

Launching a Model S P100D (weighing 5,062 with gear and driver) in full-on Ludicrous Easter-egg mode snaps your body in a manner that is utterly impossible to replicate in any other street-legal production car on normal tires and dry asphalt at a mid-$100,000 price point.

However, the impressive test results doesn’t make the Tesla Model S P100D the world’s fastest production vehicle. Once the cars accelerate beyond 70 mph, super cars like the $1.5 million Ferrari LaFerrari overtake the Model S. But when it comes to accelerating off the line at a red traffic light, this Model S leaves the pack in the rear view."

Baker + Business Reporter + Follow David R. On + Https + Www.Facebook.Com Sfchronicle + Past Articles This Author + Mark Muro + Kelly Kline + Trisha Thadani + Ashley Mcbride,"To Lexus or Mercedes, marketing cars means blanketing the airwaves with ads as polished as any Hollywood production.

To Tesla Motors, it means launching a kids’ version of the electric Model S and retweeting customers’ home videos.

Even as it begins to outsell some of its more established competitors, Tesla remains stubbornly committed to unconventional marketing. The Palo Alto company doesn’t advertise. It studiously avoids the kind of carpet-bombing marketing campaigns long favored by auto companies, which rely on a barrage of radio, print and television ads.

Instead, Tesla favors the offbeat and buzz-worthy.

This week, Tesla unveiled a child-size, $499 Model S built by Radio Flyer, a company best known for little red wagons. Video of the kiddie-car in action bounced around the Internet.

Tesla also unveiled the latest version of its customer referral program, offering the chance to win a tour of CEO Elon Musk’s private spacecraft company, SpaceX. And to tie into Fashion Week in New York, Tesla tweeted a three-minute video of Neiman Marcus’ fashion director, Ken Downing, interviewing designer Wes Gordon in the back seat of the company’s new Model X SUV while winding through the streets of lower Manhattan.

Some of Tesla’s marketing moves, the referral program included, rely on the enthusiasm of the company’s customers, many of whom preach the Tesla story with missionary fervor. The press can be counted on to cover even the company’s most minor news.

“If you think of what you’re trying to do with advertising, you’re trying to tell people about your product, about new features, new offerings,” said Wesley Hartmann, professor of marketing at Stanford University. “They’re letting other people do that for them. So what would the point be to spend money on traditional advertising?”

All of Tesla’s tactics play on the public’s curiosity about the upstart company, whose unlikely success building luxury electric cars in America fascinates even people who can’t afford the $70,000 base price. The celebrity aura surrounding Musk certainly doesn’t hurt. And the avoidance of traditional ads helps build Tesla’s image as something different, something special.

“There’s an anticipation of what Tesla is going to be,” Hartmann said. “So people are going to read news that may not be applicable to them because they want to see what’s going to happen next.”

It appears to work. Tesla boasts that its Model S sedan last year outsold comparable, gasoline-powered rivals from Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.

Tesla has not released full financial details for 2015. But in 2014, the company spent $48.9 million on marketing. General Motors spent $5.2 billion.

Of course, GM is a global automaker that sold 9.8 million vehicles last year. Tesla, whose Model S production began less than four years ago, delivered 50,580 cars in 2015.

Musk recently suggested that the company’s aversion to advertising may change when Tesla introduces the $35,000 Model 3, the company’s first car for middle-class buyers. Production is expected to begin in late 2017.

Tesla’s aspirations to penetrate the mass market rest on the Model 3. After years of targeting wealthy early adopters, Tesla may need a different approach.

“As they get into making millions of cars, they will have to start trying to reach a broader audience, whether that means television commercials or some other media,” said said Ben Kallo, a senior analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co.

Until now, he said, the company’s marketing strategy has been both cheap and effective. The company has built a powerful brand identity that merges Musk’s star power with the allure of the cars.

“The reason the brand has become so valuable is because you’ve got people willing to sell cars to their friends to tour SpaceX,” Kallo said. “That’s on the back of Elon. But it’s also about the quality of the Model S.”

If Tesla ever embraces traditional marketing strategies, what would a Tesla ad look like? In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Musk suggested that it would need to be different from standard auto-industry fare.

“In the long term, I think I could see us doing advertising where that advertising is entertaining and where people don’t regret seeing it, which unfortunately is not the case with most advertising,” he said. “We need to have a more affordable, high-volume car before that makes sense.”

If that feat just a few years ago seemed unlikely, the youthful company’s next exploit looks even more so: to prove that vehicles in the digital age can be manufactured at great speed and high quality with minimal human manual labor.

During the company’s second-quarter earnings call with financial analysts, Musk nicknamed his proposed factory “alien dreadnought”—a Star Wars battle cruiser from another galaxy.

Since it started making cars in 2008, Tesla has delivered more than 140,000 electric vehicles globally, most of them its luxury Model S sedan and the Model X crossover with gullwing doors. Earlier this year, 400,000 people each sent Tesla $1,000 deposits toward its next car, the Model 3, scheduled to begin production next July in Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California. Aimed at domination of the mass market for electric vehicles, the Model 3 is a popularly priced, battery-powered sedan that will sell for as little as $35,000. (Nissan has sold 350,000 of the current market leader, the Leaf.)

With the Model 3, Tesla is blazing toward uncharted territory and doing so with characteristic brashness. To build cars for middle-class consumers, in far greater volume and more quickly, Tesla is designing a new type of factory. If it works, it would embody revolutionary innovation in mass manufacturing.

Alien dreadnought

Tesla’s plans have not been spelled out in detail. The company didn’t furnish interviews for this story, but did answer questions via e-mail. Musk has previously declared his intent to “build a machine that builds the machine,” a highly automated vehicle factory that will stun conventional automotive manufacturers, one in which human workers will all but vanish, replaced by highly automated software-directed machinery and robots that will build Model 3s, and perhaps other Tesla models, at speeds greater than any accomplished in assembly plants operated by General Motors, Ford, Toyota, or any other global automaker. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call with financial analysts, Musk nicknamed his proposed factory “alien dreadnought”—a Star Wars battle cruiser from another galaxy.

“The point at which that's what the factory looks like, that's when you know you've won,” Musk said this summer. The futuristic assembly plant will unfold in three stages, while the number of people needed for assembly work will diminish, he said. “You can't have people in the production line itself, otherwise you drop to people speed,” Musk said. Remaining workers will be in charge of maintaining and upgrading machines, as well as “fixing anomalies.”

Musk faces new competition from automakers from Shanghai to Detroit, who have responded to Tesla’s success by accelerating electric vehicle ambitions of their own. GM is the farthest along and will begin production of the Chevrolet Bolt (to be sold as the Opel Ampera in Europe), its competitor to Tesla’s Model 3, later this year.

The way the GM cars will be built contrasts in important ways with Tesla’s method. Though crammed with modern tools, GM’s manufacturing system is stress-tested, the culmination of decades of incremental improvement designed to ensure high quality while meeting consumer demand—with little risk that the flow of vehicles to retailers and consumers will be interrupted or delayed.

By contrast, Tesla has consistently failed to live up to production forecasts. Now Musk, assuming that Tesla will be able to develop and debug a factory production system that operates unlike any the world has seen, has promised a jaw-dropper: that Tesla will deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2018, two years more quickly than an earlier forecast. Once that goal is achieved, Tesla’s output will grow by 50 percent annually, Musk says, reaching about a million vehicles delivered annually by 2020. Although that output would constitute roughly a tenth of the number of vehicles currently manufactured annually by GM, Volkswagen, or Toyota, it would elevate Tesla from a plucky niche producer to a serious industry player.

It will be a big jump for Tesla. In the first half of 2015, the carmaker built and delivered 21,537 vehicles from its single assembly plant in Fremont, California. That’s about half the total vehicles GM builds in one day at its 75 factories around the globe.

Musk’s grand manufacturing vision began with Tesla’s purchase of the Fremont assembly plant from Toyota in 2010. The CEO explained to analysts at the time that he was no more interested in replicating traditional automotive manufacturing processes than he was in designing traditional gasoline-powered cars. Accordingly, he recruited a number of manufacturing top guns from other industries, such as electronics.

Following several manufacturing delays, Musk conceded that Tesla’s designs, such as the troublesome gullwing doors on the Model X, might have been too complicated to build according to promised delivery dates. The automaker missed publicly announced production deadlines for its first three electric vehicles: the Roadster (built on a Lotus body), Model S, and Model X. In May, Tesla confirmed the departure of two top manufacturing vice presidents, one from the solar panel industry and another from an electronics manufacturer. Musk then issued a public invitation to global automotive manufacturing veterans to join the company. A week later, Tesla disclosed the hiring of Peter Hochholdinger, a veteran from Volkswagen’s Audi luxury subsidiary, to head manufacturing.

In one day GM builds twice as many cars as Tesla produced in the first six months of 2015.

Even the company’s fan base and supporters wonder whether Hochholdinger can break the trend and produce cars, notably the Model 3, according to promised delivery dates.

“Tesla Motors operates on Tesla time. Quite frequently, the infectious optimism that pervades the company causes its leadership to announce release dates for products that are … well … aggressive,” writes Roger S. Pressman, an admirer of the company, its cars, and of Musk, and whose Deerfield Beach, Florida-based supply company, EVannex, manufactures accessories for Tesla vehicles. “Often, Tesla will miss those dates, sometimes by a little, sometimes by a lot.” Pressman has written a book called Getting Ready for Model 3.

A GM rival

One reason for that may be that Tesla’s manufacturing protocol diverges from the norm for mass manufacturers in the sourcing of parts and components. Automakers that serve the mass market tend to enlist outside manufacturers to produce parts for the sake of efficiency and quality, and to take advantage of supplier innovations. Tesla instead builds more of its own parts in-house, maintaining a higher degree of vertical integration and control than is typical for a mass manufacturer. Its “gigafactory,” currently under construction in Nevada, will supply all the batteries for its cars, for example. Electric drive motors and seats are two other components that Tesla builds within its own factory walls, but that most other manufacturers outsource to suppliers.

Contemporary automakers don’t publicly embrace Musk’s worker-free vision, yet their best plants are, in fact, highly automated, equipped with robots and computer-guided machinery. The number of workers needed for assembly-line production by GM and others has continued to fall, dropping by a third on average over the past 10 to 20 years. Supplier plants, which furnish the 10,000 or more components that typically make up a vehicle’s structure, are increasingly automated as well. (A few processes, such as the manufacture of wiring harnesses that form the backbone of a vehicle’s electrical system or the sewing of upholstery on seats require relatively more labor and thus are typically outsourced to lower-wage countries.)

This system is so well developed that suppliers to major automakers continue to specialize, innovate, and fragment into “tiers”; tier one suppliers make and send parts directly to final car assembly plants while tiers two, three, and so forth furnish components and materials to tier ones and to one another.

The fantasy of a “lights out” plant—an automated plant so lacking in human presence that it could operate in the dark—has long been discussed in theoretical terms.

GM’s rival to the Model 3, its Chevy Bolt electric vehicle, will start production later this year in Orion Township, Michigan. The Bolt will be built on the same assembly line as two conventional gas-powered subcompact cars. The Bolt’s unique body architecture is designed for “manufacturability,” GM says, that is, specifically to accommodate the battery, electric motors, systems module, and cooling unit needed by an electric vehicle. Though an electric car lacks an engine, transmission, and other components needed for operation of an internal combustion engine, GM designed the Bolt so it can be assembled efficiently, at a high rate of production and at top quality, says Bill Shaw, a senior GM manufacturing executive.

Because the Bolt will be made on the same line as gas-powered cars, GM will be able to easily scale production to match market demand. “We do know we have to be agile. We’ve got a lot of levers to pull,” says Shaw.

1,000 cars a day

The goal, says Shaw, was to make the manufacturing of this vehicle as much as possible like that of other conventional models. Because the Bolt battery was designed to be installed where the gas tank goes on one of its conventional models, “the same workers can perform the two different tasks,” he says. This design minimizes cost by standardizing work and training, putting workers in a better position to avoid accidents, and ensuring that defects are avoided, says Shaw.

GM continues to add to its own high-tech manufacturing tools. Shaw described a computerized torque wrench recently developed that turns the fasteners securing Bolt’s battery to an exact tightness, while ensuring that none of the fasteners are misaligned or omitted. In case of an error, a computer notifies the operator.

The fantasy of a “lights out” plant—an automated plant so lacking in human presence that it could operate in the dark—has long been discussed in theoretical terms. In the 1980s Roger Smith, the late GM chief executive, pushed his manufacturing executives to begin to “robotize” assembly plants. Just as influential has been Toyota’s manufacturing system, which relies on low-tech principles such as just-in-time supply chain, standardized work procedures, and employee involvement in continuous improvement and efficiency to dramatically drive down manufacturing costs. GM developed its own version, the Global Manufacturing System, and for a time operated a collaboration on manufacturing methods with Toyota in the same building in Fremont that Tesla operates today.

State-of-the-art car factories rely on assembly-line workers as well as programmable machines. With a typical assembly line producing around 60 vehicles an hour or roughly 1,000 a day on two eight-hour work shifts, a line might, at the outside, be able to manufacture more than 250,000 vehicles a year. (Several North American automotive assembly plants operate on three shifts of six-and-a-half hours. The biggest produce more than 500,000 vehicles a year.) The two-shift total assumes production goes flawlessly. Factor in supplier parts shortages, machinery breakdowns, quality problems, labor issues and changes to vehicle design, and annual production drops to the more typical 100,000 to 150,000 vehicles per assembly line per year.

Those numbers show how hard a task Musk set for his company when he promised to ramp up production to 500,000 cars two years from now. The CEO may yet come up with some new surprise to keep his company in the game, but this deadline is destined to be missed."

France is trying to woo Tesla Motors to build its first full-scale European factory in the country by offering up the site of an old nuclear power plant. The Fessenheim plant in northeastern Alsace is set to shut down permanently later this year.

On Tuesday French energy minister Ségolène Royal announced she’d like to repurpose the power plant into an electric car factory.

Royal said she told Tesla CEO Elon Musk, “I’ve got a spot for you.”

A new Tesla factory would help create jobs for nuclear power plant workers in Alsace, Royal says, and would help fuel what she calls the “industry of the future,” electric cars.

And it appears Musk might be interested too. He visited France earlier this year and flirted, albeit hypothetically, with the idea of putting a European Tesla plant in Alsace:

“This is idle speculation but it’s like, well, maybe we could put a factory in Alsace,” Musk said. “It’s like half in Germany, half in France.”

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Tesla already has one smaller assembly plant in the Netherlands, but the company still manufactures all of its cars in Fremont, Calif. Musk has said he’d like to develop more factories around the globe, probably starting with one in China and one in Europe.

Transforming the Fessenheim power plant into a Tesla car factory wouldn’t happen overnight. The nuclear plant must go through a decontamination first, a process that could take years, as Electrek reports.

Still, France has not been shy about courting the automaker, even releasing this new video asking Tesla to “continue the magic in Alsace.”

A Tesla spokesperson told Fortune via email that the company has “no current plans to open a factory in Europe.”

Royal says she’ll be meeting with top Tesla bosses in a little over a week. If her appeal is successful, it could be quite the French romance for the American automaker."

Worldwide preorders for Tesla's Model 3 surpassed 275,000 in the first week that preorders were made available to the public. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Tesla, for all of its innovation and master plans to upend driving, could end up becoming something ordinary.

With the announcement of the Model 3 last week, Tesla pulled off what many would consider its most ambitious product unveiling to date.

Business Insider reported on the avalanche of preorders that followed — a number that easily climbed past 250,000 in less than three days.

Tesla plans to build 500,000 cars annually by 2020 — largely with the help of the $35,000 Model 3.

But, as Erich Joachimsthaler with Vivaldi Partners Group told Business Insider, while Tesla is busy transforming the industry, it could also transform itself into your run-of-the-mill car company.

""If General Motors' Chevy Bolt is already hugely successful in the market by the time the Model 3 comes out, or BMW or Mercedes' alternatives gain traction, I think that Tesla's brand would be diminished,"" Joachimsthaler said.

""It would just be another car manufacturer in the market, and the 500,000 units it's expecting to produce in a few years is a nonevent.""

Joachimsthaler said that because Tesla revealed the Model 3 so early — more than a year ahead of its earliest production target — its larger, deep-pocketed rivals could gain a competitive edge.

Tesla's story is curiously similar to that of the defunct car company Saturn, Joachimsthaler suggested. ""Saturn was the biggest celebration at the time in the 1990s, and then it went away,"" he said.

Bolting to the market

General Motors is closest to putting a mass-market electric car on the street. The Chevy Bolt, with its estimated 200-mile battery range, is expected to arrive a full year before the Model 3.

While the Bolt may now be a deep second to the Model 3 in terms of desirability, GM can do something Tesla can't. As Business Insider's Matt DeBord noted, Tesla's Detroit rival can afford to lose money on the Bolt, and it can even slash prices without breaking a sweat. Tesla, on the other hand, needs to sell its Model 3s.

Tesla in the 2010s almost looks like Saturn in the 1990s

Saturn wasn't selling a fleet of electric cars, but, like Tesla, Saturn launched amid considerable celebration — and doubts — about its arrival.

""People either admired the company and its cars, or were skeptical, cynical and belittling of anything it did,"" David Hanna wrote in Forbes.

Hanna's 2010 article points to some characteristics about Saturn then that resemble Tesla now:

Saturn was among the best-selling cars in 1994. (Tesla's Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, a luxury-segment mainstay, in 2015.)

Saturn consistently achieved top owner and customer sales satisfaction ratings by J.D. Powers. As late as 2000, it ranked second only to Lexus. (Consumer Reports once called Tesla the best car it ever drove.)

In its first decade, enthusiasm among Saturn owners was ""off the charts,"" Hanna recalled. ""100,000 owners attended two 'homecoming' celebrations in 1994 and 1999."" (Tesla owners are also considerably hyped about the company and its CEO, Elon Musk.)"

Evan Graduated The University Of Texas At Austin + Is A Cfa Charterholder.,"Everybody wants to be like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

But comparing any company to the Mac maker is inherently a loaded proposition, since not every one can be one of the most successful and highly valued companies of all time. While it's tempting for some to compare Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Apple, the comparison falls short in some very important ways. Yet, at the same time, both companies do share some strategic similarities.

Here are all the ways how Tesla is like Apple. (Click here for the list of ways that Tesla is not like Apple.)

Fanatic fan base

Apple's customer satisfaction and loyalty is the envy of the consumer electronics industry, thanks to a cult-like following, and Tesla is starting to build its own cult-like following of techy EV enthusiasts (I happen to be a member of both cults). Tesla's growing fan base also helps drive the company's media attention, which it relies on to bolster consumer interest instead of traditional advertising.

This is precisely how Tesla was able to have tens of thousands of prospective customers line up at its stores to reserve a Model 3 last month, all without them even knowing what the car would look like. The whole scene was very reminiscent of iPhone launches. Speaking of stores...

Retail strategy and distribution model

Tesla has also unofficially adopted Apple's retail model. The EV maker sets up stores and showrooms in areas with a lot of foot traffic, so that people can wander in and learn about the car. You don't have to drive out to that part of town where all of the car dealers have congregated, since dealers are often located close to one another to make it more convenient for car shoppers to evaluate different brands.

Like Apple, Tesla does not focus on sales commissions or incentive structures that create a hard-sell environment. Tesla sales representatives do get small commissions, but it's a small portion of their overall compensation, unlike traditional car salespeople. Tesla reps are primarily trained to educate consumers, since there's a steep educational curve associated with adopting an EV. The sales process can easily take a few hours just to answer all of the customer's questions. The product then sells itself.

Once upon a time, Apple relied primarily on third-party retailers to sell its products, but it opened its Apple Store in 2001 to take distribution into its own hands. Apple still sells through third-party retailers, but now has a massive retail operation with 469 stores globally. Tesla only sells directly to consumers and refuses to work with dealers, which is an ongoing battle.

Inventory management

Apple is also famous for an incredibly lean inventory management system, thanks in part to CEO Tim Cook's belief that ""inventory is evil."" Apple's supply chain is so streamlined in its build-to-order implementation that the company is able to put up unrivaled inventory turnover figures (currently 59.4 turns).

Tesla similarly uses a fairly lean inventory strategy as well. Nearly all of its cars are custom ordered, and the company keeps very minimal inventory on hand at each retail location (how many inventory cars can you keep in a mall store anyway?). The majority of Tesla's finished goods inventory ($476.5 million at the end of last year) consists of new vehicles in transit for delivery.

However, you can't really compare Tesla's inventory turnover of 2.8 to traditional automakers, since the incumbent OEMs utilize the dealer model and recognize revenue based primarily on wholesale deliveries. Additionally, the dealer model effectively outsources the inventory investment, so all of the inventory cars on dealer lots aren't being reflected on the balance sheet.

""Maniacal focus"" on the product

At KentPresents last year, Tesla CTO JB Straubel was asked what Tesla's ""secret sauce"" is. Straubel said that if he had to pick one thing, it would be a ""maniacal focus on making an amazing product that customers love."" This may sound familiar to anyone who's ever heard Tim Cook talk at any event ever. For a little while during Steve Jobs' absence, Apple lost sight of this, but Jobs quickly got the company back on track upon his return.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for an incredible attention to detail, similar to Jobs. He once demanded that the Model S sun visors be redesigned due to a visible seam since looking at them felt like daggers were stabbing his eyes. Musk added, ""We have to decide what is the best sun visor in the world and then do better.""

What other automaker CEO would obsess over a sun visor?

CEO involvement

This may not apply as much to Cook as it did with Jobs, but Musk is heavily involved in product design. Musk says he spends about 80% of his time in engineering and design, which is probably pretty close to what Jobs did.

Cook is more of a traditional corporate leader and admittedly not a product designer. But both Musk and Jobs have or had unique involvement in deeper parts of the business than most CEOs. For Musk, that includes highly technical engineering. For Jobs, that included things like marketing and public relations.

Integration

Apple got to where it is today by focusing heavily on integration, primarily across hardware and software but more recently incorporating services to a greater degree. Tesla is more vertically integrated than traditional automakers, for better or for worse.

Most car companies are extremely efficient systems integrators of outsourced components. Traditional automakers mostly just develop the engine and drivetrain these days, and even outsource things like infotainment head units. They also offer very little in the way of services (not including financial services).

Relative to other automakers, Tesla emphasizes deeper integration of hardware, software, and services.

Premium market leader

Apple has always positioned its products at the premium end of the spectrum, where it reigns supreme. The company has long resisted outside pressure to release low-cost devices in order to drive unit growth.

The Model S became the No. 1 large luxury sedan in the U.S. last year. Even before that, Model S was a strong contender at No. 2 in 2014. Tesla's overall unit volumes are quite small, but it does very well in the limited number of market segments that it competes in.

Who's counting?

While there are a lot of similarities between Apple and Tesla in terms of product strategy, retail model, and more, the dissimilarities deserve extra weight because you can't ignore the realities of auto manufacturing or divergent valuations."

It is one of the most high profile and innovative companies in both the tech and automotive worlds, but with that also comes high stresses.

Elon Musk is known to demand a lot of his people. Some get burned out after a while. Others just want a fresh set of challenges. One of those is Riccardo Biasini. He joined Tesla in 2011 and worked his way up in the company to the senior system engineer leading the company’s vehicle propulsion team.

SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory. https://t.co/y8s4UdMF5z — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2016

Biasani has just announced he is leaving the company to head up the AI unit at George Hotz’s start-up, Comma.ai. Hotz says his company will soon offer aftermarket systems that bring lane keeping and automatic braking to new cars. He promises his system will outperform any others on the market — including Tesla’s Autopilot.

According to Forbes, Hotz is using an Acura ILX as his test vehicle. It is equipped with 6 cameras, Lidar, and radar. A computer with a Nividia graphics card resides in the trunk and coordinates the inputs from all devices using machine learning algorithms that Hotz developed.

Also leaving Tesla is James Chen, vice president of regulatory affairs and deputy general counsel. Most recently, Chen spearheaded the operation that defeated the General Motors sponsored legislation in Indiana that would have eliminated the company’s ability to sell cars directly to customers in that state. Chen has not revealed what company he is going to next.

On the plus side, Tesla has hired Félix Godard, the designer for the interior of the futuristic Porsche Mission E electric sports car. Godard will play an important role in designing the interior of the Model 3. At is reveal, the Model 3 featured on a minimalistic dashboard unlike any seen on a production prototype before.

Tesla has confirmed that dashboard is what will be in the Model 3 when it rolls off the assembly line. When Porsche revealed a prototype of the Mission E, it had this to say in a press release. “Instruments are intuitively operated by eye tracking and gesture control, some even via holograms — highly oriented toward the driver by automatically adjusting the displays to the driver’s position.”

Elon Musk has hinted that Phase 2 of the Model 3 reveal — scheduled to take place closer to the date when production begins — will be more astounding than Phase 1. The Porsche Mission E concept may offer an important clue as to what Tesla has in mind for the final production version of its car. A full head’s up display spread across the entire windshield? Holograms? Imagine a $35,000 sedan that has the same technology as the most advanced Porsche in history.

Anytime someone leaves Tesla, there are stories about poaching and outrageous signing bonuses. The process works both ways, with the company attracting talent from other companies and some of its employees finding the grass is greener elsewhere. Tesla probably won’t miss a beat from the departure of Ricardo Biasini or James Chen. But the arrival of Félix Godard suggests exciting times ahead for Tesla."
https://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/03/tesla-model-3-on-sale-friday/,pos,0.9246580909390807,0.07534190906088155,Tesla says its affordable Model 3 car will go on sale on Friday,2017-07-03 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:41:42.314457,The Associated Press,"NEW YORK — Electric car maker Tesla says its keenly awaited Model 3 car for the masses will go on sale on Friday.

CEO Elon Musk made the announcement Monday on Twitter.

The car is to start around $35,000 and with a $7,500 federal electric car tax credit, could cost $27,500. Tesla says the five-seat car will be able to go 215 miles (133 kilometers) on a single charge and will be sporty, accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in under six seconds.

Musk had said that production was on track to start in July, but Tesla has often faced delays in getting vehicles to market. The Palo Alto, California-based company aims to make 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of this year and 10,000 per week in 2018.

Tesla hasn’t said how many people have put down $1,000 refundable deposits for the Model 3, but Musk has said people who put down a deposit now won’t get a car until the end of 2018, suggesting it could be close to 500,000.

Whether Tesla can meet its production goals is an open question. Its last new vehicle, the Model X SUV, was delayed nearly 18 months. Musk says the Model 3 is much simpler to make, but 14-year-old Tesla has no experience producing and selling vehicles in high volumes. Tesla made just 84,000 cars last year. Bigger rivals like General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota routinely sell around 10 million vehicles per year.

Even if the Model 3 is on time, servicing all those vehicles will still be a challenge. Model S and Model X owners are already worried about having to share Tesla’s company-owned charging stations with an influx of new cars. And while Tesla is promising to increase its network of stores and service centers by 30 percent this year, it began 2017 with just 250 service centers worldwide. That leaves many potential owners miles from a service center.

Musk has said a new fleet of mobile service trucks will be deployed to help customers who are far from service centers. Tesla also plans to double its global high-speed charging points to 10,000 by the end of this year and increase them by another 50 percent-100 percent in 2018.

Until recently, Tesla owned the market for fully-electric vehicles that can go 200 miles (324 kilometers) or more on a charge. But that’s changing. GM beat Tesla to the mass market with the Chevrolet Bolt, a $36,000 car that goes 238 miles (about 200 kilometers) per charge. Audi plans to introduce an electric SUV with 300 miles (486 kilometers) of range next year; Ford will have one by 2020. Volkswagen plans more than 30 electric vehicle models by 2025.

Automotive competitors like Mercedes and Volvo — not to mention tech companies like Google and Uber — can also match Tesla’s efforts to develop self-driving vehicles. And they have deeper pockets. Tesla has had only two profitable quarters in its seven years as a public company.

But before those happy early adopters drove home in their all-electric dream cars, Elon Musk spent a few minutes speaking to the crowd and to a live stream. It went about as well as most of his public speeches go, with the Tesla CEO oscillating between funny, awkward, and sort of heartfelt. And then, of course, he made the same sex joke he’s been making for years.

It’s time he stopped.

If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, here’s a mercifully quick recap: at some point early in his tenure with Tesla, Musk decided that he wanted the naming convention for Tesla’s cars to follow a pattern. First there would be the Model S, then the Model X, and finally the Model E. Shuffle those around and — guess what? — they spell “sex!” But a curmudgeonly combustion-engine carmaker got in the way of Musk’s fun. Ford threatened to sue over the trademark, and so the Model E became the Model 3.

Musk is smart enough to know that a generation of millennials fluent in 1337 5p34k would still be able to get the joke, so he kept making it anyway. Basically any time Musk spoke in public — at official company events, during live streams, speaking to investors — he’d make a joke about how his company’s cars’ names spell out S-3-X. (He’s also teased a crossover SUV called the Model Y.)

S, 3, X on a bridge pic.twitter.com/2E57xqkTVY — Tesla (@TeslaMotors) July 29, 2017

Musk, of course, made the joke again at last night’s Model 3 handover event. And shortly after, the Tesla Motors Twitter account tweeted a video of the company’s three cars driving together with the caption: “S, 3, X on a bridge.”

This is a man whose company’s mere existence has helped prod the competition into taking electric technology seriously, something that could actually change the world, and yet he can’t stop making an unnecessary joke about sex. And not just unnecessary, but inappropriate, considering Tesla’s factory has been labeled a “predator zone” by its female employees.

Tesla exists in the middle of a Venn diagram between Silicon Valley and the automobile world — two industries that are plagued by sexism, harassment, and general inequality between men and women. But Tesla’s supposed to be about making the world a better place. At the very least, Elon Musk could live up to that standard by dropping the joke."

The answer: sometime mid-2018, according to CEO Elon Musk.

The standard or “slowest” version of the Model 3 can travel from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds and the upgraded longer battery iteration reaches 60 mph at an even faster 5.1 seconds.

Tesla hasn’t released any information about a performance version of a Model 3. But over the weekend, Musk responded to one fan’s question that confirms there will be a performance Model 3 in the future.

Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model 3 production hell. More versions = deeper in hell. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2017

But the company has a few versions of the Model 3 to get through before it tackles a zippier one.

Tesla will first produce the more expensive longer range battery version of the Model 3, which gets 310 miles to change, sometime between November and January 2018. Production of the standard battery, which gets 220 miles to a charge, will begin in November, followed by an all-wheel drive version begins in the spring.

Tesla will start producing a performance Model 3 sometime in mid-2018, Musk said. International deliveries of left-hand drive vehicles begin in the second half of the year.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

It’s unclear just how fast a performance Model 3 will be. If it’s anything like the performance version of the Model S sedan, expect it to get close to breaking some records and costing a lot more than the base price of $35,000.

The Model S P100D, the maximum performance available in this vehicle, can travel from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds and starts at $128,200."

Major: Mechanical Engineering

Home town: Lagos, Nigeria

Where did you intern? With the Battery Safety and R&D team at Tesla Motors Palo Alto, California. Located on the Stanford University campus, the Tesla headquarters is surrounded by California’s beaches, San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge and, of course, the beautifully crafted Tesla Model S and Model X fully electric cars. I made history as part of the Tesla team for the newly released Model 3.

What did you do there? The Battery Safety R&D group at Tesla had an ongoing project to improve the design of lithium ion cells (batteries).

I attended lectures, workshops and presentations by NASA, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Tesla and Elon Musk. My internship involved high-precision machine shops and tooling, laser welding, high temperature pressure transducers, flame resolution thermal imaging cameras, Matlab and a lot of fireworks and explosions at a lab nicknamed “The Bunker.”

How did the work you do connect back to your coursework? Similar to what I spent my summer working on at Tesla, my work at FIU involved experimental and numerical investigation into high temperature and pressure phenomenon. The work at Tesla, however, involved significantly more volatile extremes that require a unique methodology. Tesla provided me with knowledge on improved lab techniques and state-of-the-art instrumentation.



What was the coolest thing about your experience? Many, many cool things … standing shoulder to shoulder with 450 students students from MIT, Harvard, UC Berkley, Stanford, and other ivy league colleges – I was excited to represent FIU. Also cool: being involved in groundbreaking empirical contributions to the fundamental understanding of thermal runaway, which occurs in situations where an increase in battery temperature could lead to a destructive result.

Two of the experimental rigs I designed were used for actual process improvement at Tesla. I enjoyed BlackFest, a music festival at Stanford; I traveled to the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bissau Baobab Village; and I went whale watching. If I had to choose the coolest thing, I’d say it was being part of a group of people passionately driven by excellence at Tesla.

What did you learn about yourself? FIU is as good as any ivy league school, and our emphasis on understanding the fundamentals of a subject matter helps to develop solutions to practical problems. I also learned I’m not as effective a communicator as I could be, and effective verbal and nonverbal communication skills are very essential in the workplace.

What advice do you have for others just starting the internship process? Effective workplace communication is important in companies with workplace diversity. Good communication skills help to reduce the language and cultural barriers."

Peltz,"Tesla Motors Inc. reported an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss of $320 million on Wednesday as the maker of luxury electric cars incurred heavy costs related to developing two new models.



The Palo Alto company's primary car is the Model S sedan, and last fall it launched the Model X sport utility vehicle. Tesla also plans a lower-priced, mass-market electric car called the Model 3 for late 2017.



The Model X has been the subject of delays and hefty costs related to ramping up production, and Tesla delivered only 206 of the SUVs in the fourth quarter, well below earlier projections.



Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged that the automaker tried to do ""too many great things all at once"" that have helped hobble the Model X's rollout. ""There was some hubris with the X,"" he told Wall Street analysts on a conference call.



But Musk said those snags were mostly behind the company and ""the net result, however, is that I think the Model X is an amazing car.""



Tesla's fourth-quarter loss using standard ""generally accepted accounting rules"" compared with a loss of $107.7 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 27% to $1.21 billion from $957 million.



Tesla prefers to focus on its non-GAAP financial results, which are adjusted for leasing factors and other items, but even on that basis Tesla's loss was much worse than Wall Street expected.



The company's non-GAAP loss widened to $113.9 million, or 87 cents a share, whereas analysts polled by FactSet Research Systems Inc. had expected a profit of 16 cents a share.



Either way, Tesla's inability to turn a profit in large part reflected a 42% surge in its operating costs, to $479 million, during the quarter.



But Tesla said it expects to be profitable by the end of this year, and it plans to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles overall, up at least 60% from 50,580 last year.



That would include producing up to 1,000 Model X vehicles a week during the second quarter, Tesla said, although Musk told the analysts that 1,000 ""would probably be a peak production week.""



When asked to forecast the sales mix of the Model S and Model X this year, Musk declined to be precise, saying, ""We need to see how customers react when both cars are in the showrooms and we'll adjust accordingly.""



Tesla said its capital spending in the quarter totaled $411 million, mainly for the Model X, additional retail and service centers and for its so-called gigafactory near Reno, where Tesla is building a giant plant to produce battery packs for its cars.



As for the Model 3, Tesla said it plans to unveil the car March 31 and to start production and deliveries in late 2017.



The growing pains at Tesla, whose cars typically sell for $80,000 to $100,000, have taken a toll on the company's once high-flying stock.



The results were announced after the stock market closed Wednesday. Tesla shares fell $4.58, or 3.1%, to $143.67 during the session, giving it a 40% loss so far this year.



But the shares rebounded to $156.20 in after-hours trading following the announcement, which drew a divided response from analysts.



""We know the revenue is going up and production is going up, but spending is going up even faster and causing a bigger loss than expected,"" said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.



""The timing of the Model 3 also concerns me because it's at least a year after the Chevrolet Bolt arrives, and additional pure electrics with a similar range could easily show up by late 2017,"" he added.



But analyst Sam Korus of ARK Invest, which owns Tesla stock in three of its

investment funds, said investors should take a longer-term view of Tesla's development.



""They're still very much in the ramping [up] process,"" Korus said. ""People want [production] at scale faster than it is and don't appreciate the actual cost of getting there.""



The Model X features three rows of seats, can accommodate seven passengers and has doors that open in a ""falcon-wing"" design.



In taking some of the blame for the Model X's slow start, Musk said ""in retrospect it would have been a better decision to do fewer things with the first version of Model X and then roll in the capabilities and features and new technologies over time.



""I'm not sure anyone is going to make a car like this again,"" Musk said. ""I'm not sure Tesla would make a car like this again.""

The news comes from Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, who discussed that additional manufacturing plans for the Gigafactory during a policy speech on Tuesday.

The Gigafactory, which officially opened for business last year, is a massive facility with a $5 billion price tag, a solar-power generating roof and a final physical footprint of around 5.8 million square feet, with total usable square footage of more than 13 million feet thanks to use of multiple internal floors. It began large scale battery production for use in Tesla’s Powerwall and Powerpack products earlier this year, and will spin up production for Model 3 battery units later in 2017.

Pleased to announce that @TeslaMotors will expand its investment in #NV by producing electric motors & gearboxes at #Gigafactory #nvsots — Governor Sandoval (@GovSandoval) January 18, 2017

Expanding production capacity to include electric motors and gearbox components should definitely help Tesla make use of its expanding space at the Nevada facility, and Sandoval says it’ll also result in 550 new jobs at the manufacturing site in his state, Fortune reports. The Gigafactory is only around 30 percent complete right now, with new modules being brought online as they’re completed thanks to its unique design.

Tesla likes to own as much of the vehicle production process as is possible, and especially in the case of core technologies it believes will eventually drive its ability to be cost competitive. It currently builds its electric motors for the Model S and Model X in-house at its Fremont, CA factory, but using the Gigafactory for Model 3 production makes sense, given Tesla has a goal of building 500,000 of the upcoming electric sedan in its first full year of production."

Tesla’s plans to disrupt the semi-truck business with a new electric big rig could launch a new revolution — and CEO Elon Musk isn't holding back on the hyperbole.

Musk is pledging a groundbreaking advancement Thursday night at an event near Los Angeles to release details on the new truck..

“This will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension,” Musk said Sunday in a tongue-in-cheek tweet.

The race to deliver electric trucks could eventually pose economic benefits to consumers if the technology lowers the price of transportation and reduces emissions that contribute to climate change.

Still, industry experts are skeptical that Tesla, known for its Model S and X electric luxury vehicles, can overhaul the long-haul trucking business. Trucks that deliver goods in cities are a better fit for current electric-vehicle technology because they generally don’t need to travel far in a day, can be centrally charged and can take advantage of braking in stop-and-go traffic to recharge their batteries.

Today’s batteries limit the driving range of electric cars to a few hundred miles at most. That’s the main reason why diesel continues to power most heavy trucks, which typically travel 500 or more miles on a given day.

But disruption is coming. Musk has promised to “deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transportation, while being safer and really fun to operate” — and Tesla’s not the only one vowing to lead the way.

“I know several of our customers who have had the opportunity to see and or drive the Tesla truck, so I know it’s a reality,” said Troy Clarke, CEO of truckmaker Navistar. With electric trucks in general, “there is still limited range, but these are technical issues that everyone has confidence will ultimately be solved.”

Scott Corwin, who leads Deloitte’s Future of Mobility consulting division, said that electric trucks will appeal to shipping companies as battery costs fall and lower maintenance costs prove appealing.

“When you think about gas mileage with long-haul trucks, the average miles per gallon are really low so they’re consuming a really significant amount of fuel. If we can move to electric the cost of electricity will make the cost go down,” Corwin said.

Aiding the transition is the Obama administration’s implementation of stricter fuel-economy standards for heavy-duty trucks. They are expected to cut emissions and improve fuel economy from 6.6 miles per gallon in 2017 to 8.8 mpg in 2027. It might not sound like much of a difference, but in the trucking world, a 33% improvement would be huge.

Jason Roycht, vice president and head of parts maker Bosch’s commercial vehicle and off-road business unit in the U.S., said truckers will make the swift switch to electric as soon as it’s cheaper.

“There is actually a strong case to be made that electrification in various forms can actually not only provide a benefit … in terms of the environment but can also provide a total-cost-of-ownership advantage,” Roycht said. “That’s what really makes it really interesting right now.”

Some industry leaders are skeptical that electric trucks will lead the way to improved fuel efficiency over today’s trucks.

“There’s just certain limits to not only the technology and the maturity of the batteries themselves but also … the weight impact it has and the power performance,” said Keith Brandis, vice president of product planning for Volvo Trucks. Diesel is “much cleaner today than it’s ever been and it will be more energy efficient for many years into the future.”

The race begins

Nonetheless, Tesla joins a wide field of established truckmakers and start-ups tackling electric trucks:

•Navistar and Volkswagen: The supplier and German automaker recently reached a deal to collaborate on technology.

Navistar plans to deliver an electric medium-duty truck by 2019 or 2020. Volkswagen is developing an urban electric truck, the e-Delivery, with production due to begin in 2020.

“We’re extremely excited about the electrification of commercial vehicles,” Clarke said, though he added that he believes the transition will be gradual.

•Nikola Motor. The start-up — named after, yes, inventor Nikola Tesla — is aiming to deliver a long-haul hydrogen-electric truck to customers as early as 2020. The company has drawn the industry’s attention by signing a technology partnership with German automotive supplier Bosch.

“I personally believe in the next 10 years you won’t be able to buy a diesel anymore,” said Trevor Milton, CEO of Nikola Motor. “It’s game over.”

Milton said Nikola Motor has already received $6.5 billion in refundable deposits, which he’s counting as preorders, much like Tesla counts deposits as reservations.

He said the company would soon announce plans for a 1.5 million-square-foot, $1.25 billion manufacturing plant with more than 3,000 workers, likely in the eastern United States.

•Bosch: The company’s decision to partner with Nikola amplified the start-up’s profile in the automotive world but also positions the German supplier as a potentially critical component in the trucking sector’s revolution.

•Cummins. For the Indiana-based manufacturer, which produced 1.1 million engines last year, electric trucks represent a significant threat — and opportunity. After recently announcing an electric truck concept called Aeos, Cummins acknowledged Tesla’s technological prowess but said its expertise in the trucking business should not be taken for granted.

""In the short term, they might have an advantage,"" Srikanth Padmanabhan, president of Cummins' engine business, said of Tesla. ""But in the long run, it is difficult to replicate … what we have in terms of distribution and support (and) customer relationships.""

•Daimler. The German maker of the Mercedes-Benz brand of luxury cars plans to begin production in 2019 on the FUSO eCanter electric light-duty truck for customers such as shipping giant UPS.

Charging challenge

One of the biggest inhibitors of electric powertrains for long-haul trucks is long charging times and wear and tear that repeated charging cycles exerts on batteries.

Batteries can only be charged for a certain number of cycles before they begin to lose their capacity. Nikola CEO Milton said current batteries would last only 100,000 to 200,000 miles for a semitruck. Replacing it would require an investment of between $60,000 to $100,000, he estimated. That’s untenable for long-haul truckers and trucking companies.

“That’s why we went to a fuel cell,” he said.

But hydrogen has its own fueling challenge: Where to fill up? Hydrogen fueling infrastructure is limited today.

Milton said it will require installing hydrogen stations on fixed routes, but he said it makes more economical sense for commercial vehicles than for consumer cars.

But perhaps the best perk of being Elon Musk is the ability to be unbelievably petty.

The Californian venture capitalist Stewart Alsop learned that to his cost, he says, after he wrote an open letter to Musk about the badly run launch event for the Tesla Motors Model X (the newest car from Musk’s electric vehicle startup).

Headlined “Dear @ElonMusk: you should be ashamed of yourself”, the letter listed Alsop’s issues with the event: it started late, it focused too much on safety, and it was so packed that even people like Alsop, who had placed a $5,000 deposit on the car (which was originally supposed to ship in 2013, but had only delivered 208 cars by the end of 2015), didn’t get the chance to test drive it.

Alsop concluded that “it would still be nice if you showed some class and apologised to the people who believe in this product”.

Instead, Alsop says, Musk cancelled his pre-order.

In a follow-up post, “Banned By Tesla!”, Alsop relayed his phone conversation with Musk: “I also hear that you are not comfortable having me own a Tesla car and have cancelled my order for a Tesla Model X.”

He added “I must also admit that I am a little taken aback to be banned by Tesla. When I wrote a blog post about my BMW X1 called ‘My Car Makes Me Feel Stoopid’, the CEO of BMW didn’t take the car back.”

Musk, for his part, tweeted to indicate that he doesn’t understand what the fuss is about:

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention

It’s not the first time Musk has demonstrated the level of personal control he exerts over Tesla. In late January, a frustrated Tesla customer revealed that a refurbished car on which he had put a deposit was never delivered – because Musk was using it to test out a new version of the fleet’s “Autopilot” feature.

Tesla eventually said that that “due to human error, a car from our test fleet was offered for sale. We apologise that this led to a frustrating experience. We are working to ensure that it never happens again.”"

It's suposed to be cheaper per mile than diesel, and deliver a safety experience on the highway the industry currently lacks. The new all electric semi truck looks like an electric train, with the driver seated in the center of an aerodynamic cab.

And while it may not YET be Optimus Prime, considering Musk's fears about artificial intelligence, it's good he's seeing the possibilities. Sticking with today's version of the truck, here's how the Tesla Semi improves on existing semi trucks:

1) 500 miles of range

2) Speed: 0-60 in twenty seconds with load

3) 80,000lb load capacity

4) Onboard sensor set to reduce jackknifing, improve stability, and continue to update the truck's onboard computer with safety insights

5) Up to 400 miles of charge in just over half an hour (or ""on your break"" as Elon puts it)

6) Serious driver upgrade in the cockpit, with touchscreen displays for navigation, routing and connectivity and the driver centered over the chassis like a racecar

7) Reservations for a truck are only $5,000.

Tesla semi truck: industry antidote?

Does it sound like fun? Yes it does, and fun (and safety) may just be the antidote the trucking industry needs for the pressures it's facing under extreme sustained growth. (E-commerce and the on-demand economy are making trucking one of the toughest professions out there.)

Here's how the industry looks as Tesla enters the market:

· Roadway fatalities for truckers are up again year over year.

· Truck driver deaths are over one-quarter of the fatal annual occupational injuries in this country.

· Truck driving is the most dangerous profession in the US. Over half of trucking fatalities involved the vehicle itself.

· The American Trucking Association projects that by 2027, freight will grow 35%.

· A survey of 2,200 commercial trucking execs reports they believe that retaining drivers is their most crucial strategic initiative"

They not only unveiled the stunning design of Tesla’s new sports car, but they also announced some mind-boggling specs that are sure to break a lot of records.

In our pre-event live podcast, we speculated that Tesla could reveal more about the upcoming vehicle due to the automaker out-of-the-blue offering discounts for the vehicle through the referral program.

Yet, it’s was hard not to be amazed when they pulled out the all-electric sports car out of the trailer of one of the two Tesla Semi prototypes.

Earlier this summer, Tesla’s Design Chief Franz von Holzhausen said that he was hitching to design an electric sports car since joining Tesla in 2008.

Now it’s finally here and it is stunning.

Here are a few official images released by Tesla:

The prototype was swamped by people in the attendance as soon as Elon called for them to go see it, but Electrek’s Jamie managed to get close enough to the red prototype to capture a few more pictures:

It’s hard to see in the back, but the vehicle is actually a four seater.

There was also another prototype in another area of the event. I managed to also get a few pictures:

We will try to grab more images and videos, but the design is just one aspect of what appears to be a simply insane machine.

Now no matter how crazy those specs sound, Musk said that it is actually what they are achieving with their prototype.

We are talking about a 200 kWh battery pack in a vehicle that is not much smaller than a Model 3. The energy capacity is enough to travel over 620 miles on a single charge, according to Tesla.

The battery pack powers three electric motors unleashing enough power to achieve a 0 to 60 mph time of 1.9 seconds – the quickest of any production car ever.

It also translates to a 0 to 100 mph time of 4.2 seconds, a quarter-mile in just 8.9 seconds, and record-breaking 250+ mph top speed.

Seth got a quick test ride in the car after placing a $5,ooo deposit (seriously). Here’s a 360-degree video of it.

Musk said that the vehicle will hit the market only in 2020, so there’s definitely time for those specs to evolve. For now, we will just marvel at the possibilities.

Update: After the event, we also learned that the Founders Series version of the car costs $250,000 and Tesla will make 1,000 units. Buyers have to put the full amount to reserve the vehicles and it’s not clear how the referral program plays into it at this point. People can also reserve a regular production Roadster with a $50,000 deposit.

On Tuesday, Musk made a bold power play with his company Tesla Motors (tsla), where he is CEO, offering to buy SolarCity (scty), where Musk is chairman. Musk isn’t the first CEO to merge two of his companies, but the move is unusual because of his unique relationship to Tesla and SolarCity: Musk is their largest shareholder, owning more than 20%, of each. On top of that, SolarCity’s CEO Lyndon Rive is also Musk’s first cousin.

Because of the blindingly obvious conflicts of interest (which don’t end there—more on that later), Musk went out of his way to head off accusations of self-dealing and nepotism. In the announcement of the deal, Musk recused himself from voting on the deal both as a board member and as a shareholder. A majority of Tesla and SolarCity’s non-Musk shareholders will have to vote in favor of the deal in order to approve it, Musk told analysts on Wednesday. “We’ve tried to do this in a way that’s as fair as possible, and really going beyond what’s legally required to make it not just legally correct, but morally correct,” Musk said.

But investors are questioning whether Musk’s professions of ethics and objectivity are sincere, or just for show. Antonio Gracias, an investor who also sits on the boards of both companies, and SolarCity’s Rive also recused themselves from the board votes. They and Musk, however, will still be in the room and participating in the board’s discussions of the deal, Tesla specified during the call on Wednesday. And in case there was any doubt about whether the rest of the board members might feel differently about the transaction, Musk cleared that up, telling analysts, “The board opinion is unanimous at both companies.”

Not that the consensus should be a surprise: Besides Musk, Rive, and Gracias, SolarCity’s board includes Musk’s other first cousin Peter Rive (Lyndon’s brother), as well as Tesla’s co-founder and CTO Jeffrey Staubel. Tesla’s board includes Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk, and Brad Buss, who served as SolarCity’s CFO until he retired in February. That leaves just three supposedly neutral directors on each board. If you count the representatives of venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which has a seat at each company—Fisher at SolarCity, Jurvetson at Tesla—that leaves only two directors per board without conflict. That’s “an awful lot of cross-pollination,” an Oppenheimer analyst remarked on the conference call.

Critics went further in attacking seemingly incestuous nature of the deal. It’s a “shameful example of corporate governance at its worst,” Jim Chanos, the famous short-seller known for his lucrative bet against Enron, told CNBC. (Chanos is shorting both Tesla and SolarCity stock.) Because of the “corporate governmental mess,” according to Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin, there’s only “a low 20 to 40% probability” the deal will actually happen.

Besides the board conflicts, Jobin wrote in a research note, Musk’s stockholdings in the companies—and the fact that he has taken out personal loans using his shares as collateral—will also raise eyebrows.

Indeed, Musk himself may already be complicating the deal because of his closeness to both companies.

Shares of Tesla dropped more than 10% on Wednesday in part because of Musk’s lack of details and financial rationale for merging his companies. But the reason may not just be that Musk was bad at sharing his vision with other investors. Tesla was forced to announce its offer for SolarCity before fully analyzing the transaction’s financial impact because of Musk’s status as a SolarCity shareholder obligated Tesla to go public with its proposal as soon as negotiations began. If not, it could have appeared that Musk was secretly benefiting from insider information about the deal.

While the deal is unlikely to go hostile, SolarCity is still bound by a fiduciary duty to seek the highest possible acquisition price for its shareholders. And it is possible someone will come along with a better deal. Tesla’s offer, while it values SolarCity’s shares at up to 30% more than their market price before the deal was announced, is still less than half of what SolarCity was worth at the end of 2015.

Musk might have something to learn from another company insider who tried to buy (back) his own company: Michael Dell, who took his technology firm Dell private in 2013 in a highly contested battle. “SolarCity should shop the deal as hard Michael Dell did,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. Dell employed “a model of diligent objective external deal shopping,” Sonnenfeld says. Still, a Delaware court last month found that the company shortchanged its shareholders by about $6 billion—even though Dell did nothing wrong. Musk may find that his objectivity and morals aren’t enough for his shareholders.

May 27th, 2016 by Chris Boylan

The Tesla Model 3 is poised to change the automotive world forever. It’s a sporty, attractive 5-passenger sedan, with at least 215 miles of range, a 0–60 MPH time of under 6 seconds, and a starting price of just $35,000. The Model 3 had 325,000 paid reservations in the week of its unveiling (up to 373,000 now), and it doesn’t use a drop of gas. What’s not to like?

But the Model 3 didn’t just spring fully formed out of the fertile mind of a mad genius. The Model 3 will actually be the 4th automobile offered by the California automaker. And to get a sense of what it may become, we must acknowledge what came before it. We’ve partnered with Graphic News to present Tesla’s first 10 years of automotive achievements in a simple infographic. It shows the steps Tesla has taken moving toward CEO Elon Musk’s Secret Master Plan.

In case you’re unfamiliar, Musk’s master plan was (and is) to wean the world off of its addiction to oil by offering a fully electric vehicle that people would actually want to own, and could afford. To get there, first build an expensive sports car with great handling, performance, and long range to show what’s possible with EVs (the Roadster). Use the money from that car to build a more affordable family car (Model S and Model X). Use the money from those cars to build an even more affordable car. And that will be the Model 3.

The Roadster kicked things off with impressive stats: 0 to 60 MPH in under 4 seconds and a range of 244 miles per charge. At the time, this was the longest range production EV, by far. And it took home a world record in 2009 for a 311 mile trip on one charge. The company built and sold about 2,450 Roadsters between 2008 and 2012. Meanwhile, the company began work on a more affordable car: the Model S family sedan.

When Tesla started taking orders for the Model S, a 40 kWh battery version was offered for $57,400. That version of the Model S only had about 160 miles of range and was not a popular option compared to the 60 kWh and 85 kWh versions. The 40 kWh Model S was discontinued in 2013 before being manufactured, but the original order price was honored and customers received a software-limited version of the 60 kWh battery, with the option to unlock the full range of the 60 kWh battery for a fee.

In 2012, Tesla started to manufacture the Model S, delivering about 3,100 cars that year. Performance was close to the Roadster (0–60 in 4.2 seconds for the P85 Model S), it had even greater range (270 miles) and sat up to seven people with optional jump seats for kids in the rear hatch. In 2012, Tesla also unveiled what may have been its secret weapon: a high-speed charging network that enabled Tesla owners to replenish half of their cars’ range in 20–30 minutes, or go from empty to fully charged in about an hour. The Tesla Supercharger network made long-distance travel in an EV almost as convenient as in a gas car. The kicker? It would be free for life for Model S owners.

Over the next three years, Tesla ramped up production to over 50,000 cars a year, introduced larger battery packs with close to 300 miles of range, as well as a “Ludicrous Speed” mode that shaved the 0–60 time all the way down to 2.8 seconds. Tesla also introduced its Autopilot self-driving feature, which allows the car to stay in its lane and keep a safe distance from other cars, even in stop-and-go traffic. Just please try not to fall asleep. So, yeah, the Model S is quicker off the line than a supercar, but with room to fit the entire family with all their gear, and it can practically drive itself. And it’s powered by electricity.

Another part of the “Master Plan” was to offer choices. Not everyone wants to drive a sedan. So, in 2012, before they began deliveries of the Model S, Tesla unveiled the Model X: a fully electric crossover/SUV built on the Model S platform. The Model X promised similar performance to the Model S but added the utility and versatility of an SUV. It has seating for seven adults, the higher driving position of an SUV, a giant panoramic windshield that extends behind the front seat passengers’ heads for maximum visibility, and towing capability up to 5,000 pounds (a first in an electric SUV). The Model X also offers unique falcon-wing doors, designed to make it easier for rear-seat passengers to enter and exit the vehicle. Oh, who are we kidding? The falcon-wing doors are there because they look cool. As the Model X neared production in 2015, Musk also showed off a new air filtration system with dual-activated carbon filters and HEPA filtration that can keep cabin air fresh and clean, whether you’re dealing with smog, a fragrant cow pasture, or a full-on biological weapon attack. The so-called “Bioweapon Defense Mode” should prove particularly popular in areas of the world that suffer from excessive air pollution.

When Model X pricing was revealed in late 2015, the electric SUV came in at just a bit more expensive than the current Model S. While the dual-motor 70 kWh Model S was selling for $75,000, the Model X was introduced at a price of $80,000. Similar to the 40 kWh Model S, the entry-level 70 kWh Model X was cancelled before production, replaced with a slightly longer-range (higher-capacity) 75 kWh battery version for $3,000 more ($83,000). Those who had already ordered a 70 kWh version got the larger battery at no extra charge. A 90 kWh battery was also offered. While the X is a much heavier car than the Model S, the range and performance numbers are still pretty impressive. With the top-of-the-line performance package and “Ludicrous Speed,” the Model X can hit 60 MPH from zero in just 3.2 seconds. And the longest-range 90 kWh non-performance version gets a respectable 257 miles of range between charges.

Although all of Tesla’s cars to date have suffered from delays in their launch and early production (and they’re still working out kinks in the Model X), the company appears to be committed to improving quality and continues to accelerate manufacturing. They’ve already got an assembly plant in Europe and are considering expanding production to China, among other places, in order to satisfy global demand. Tesla’s current factory in Fremont, California, produced over 400,000 cars a year at its peak in its previous life as the NUMMI plant (a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors). That was before the extensive overhaul that Tesla has performed since it took over the facility.

Can the company really fulfill the existing 373,000 reservations for the Model 3 in a timely fashion? In 2015, the company delivered just over 50,000 cars. Considering they delivered only 3,100 cars in 2012, this is respectable growth. Tesla’s 2016 guidance is to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 cars (Model S and Model X). But on the most recent earnings call, Musk has confirmed that the company’s intention is to deliver the first batches of the Model 3 in 2017 and to ramp up production to a run rate of 500,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2018. Yes, that’s close to 10,000 cars per week by the end of 2018. That would be a 10-fold increase in production capacity in just 3 years.

A recent stock offering raised about $1.5 billion of fresh capital to help ramp things up. And the company hired seasoned automotive industry manufacturing veteran Peter Hochholdinger away from Audi to help oversee the rapid ramp. Musk and CTO JB Straubel have promised us that they’ve learned their lessons in manufacturing with the Roadster, the Model S, and particularly the Model X. Musk has gone on record (in a recent earnings call) to say that the Model X probably was “the most difficult car in the world to build.” He went even further to say, “I’m not sure anyone should have made this car.” So the Model 3 is being designed along the KISS mantra (Keep It Simple, Stupid). It is being conceptualized from the ground up to be simple to manufacture, with fewer moving parts and a much simpler design than its predecessors.

Will this allow Tesla to finally hit its (admittedly aggressive) production goals and usher in a new era of environmentally friendly personal transportation? 373,000 people (including yours truly) sure hope so.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Solar City/AP Solar City/AP

Tesla Motors moved a step closer in its bid to buy SolarCity after federal regulators said the $2.6 billion deal doesn't present antitrust concerns.

Tesla announced plans to purchase the solar panel installer earlier this month, and Reuters says the Federal Trade Commission quickly signed off ""because the merging companies have few or no overlaps.""

NPR's Jeff Brady has more on the deal:

""Tesla is pursing the acquisition because on top of building cars, the company says it wants to produce the renewable energy that could power them. ""The deal comes as rooftop solar companies face pressure from competition and a changing regulatory landscape. Utility regulators across the country have begun reducing the subsidies designed to encourage new solar panel installations.""

SolarCity agreed to the deal amid decreased expectations of growth for the company. As Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Liam Denning wrote shortly after:

""SolarCity's cash balance at the end of June was less than a third the level of a year earlier. ""SolarCity blamed the rapid burn in the second quarter in part on Tesla's initial takeover announcement, saying it complicated getting some financing in the door by the end of June. ""But that takeover offer is a lifeline, albeit a qualified one. Until Tesla made its announcement, SolarCity's stock had joined its peers in a downhill run this year.""

In January, Jeff reported that the company would cut more than 500 jobs after Nevada regulators ""increased a fee for solar customers and reduced how much utilities pay for excess power sold back to the grid."" And just this week, SolarCity announced layoffs for 108 employees at two of its California offices in anticipation of the Tesla deal, The Mercury News reports.

That report came a day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who is SolarCity's chairman, its largest shareholder and a cousin of founders Lyndon and Peter Rive — announced his plan to purchase $65 million in bonds from SolarCity."

John Has Been Writing About The Auto Business + Investing For Over Years + For The Motley Fool Since,"Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday announced an even quicker version of the already-quick Model S: The company's latest 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack will allow the new ""P100D"" version of the big electric sedan to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 2.5 seconds.

That's quicker than any currently mass-produced car in the world. (In fact, it's quicker than a lot of high-performance motorcycles.) But some of what Musk said about the new P100D is problematic -- and it's drawing some sharp criticism. Here's why.

Critics let fly at Musk's ""fastest car"" claim

This will seem like a nitpick, but bear with me: The P100D isn't, as Musk said, ""the fastest car in the world."" That would require the Tesla to have a top speed of well over 200 miles per hour, but (at least as far as we know) it doesn't: Tesla's software limits the top speed of its vehicles to 155 miles per hour.

That was an unusually imprecise statement by Musk, who typically explains engineering and physics concepts with care. But the larger point is this: Yes, the Teslas (there will be a P100D version of the Model X SUV, too) get to 60 mph really, really quickly. But that's just one aspect of what it means to have a high-performance vehicle -- and it's a limited one.

Critics are already taking aim. Kelley Blue Book analyst Michael Harley called Musk's announcement ""nothing more than headline-grabbing showmanship"" -- and then he really let fly:

Tesla's Model S and Model X are not performance vehicles, despite Elon's continuous attempts to market them as such. True sports cars are not only capable in the sprint, but are adept in handling and braking as well -- his sedan and crossover lack both of those skills. With limited top speeds, and the inability to circle a complete racing circuit without overheating, they are nothing more than a pair of one-trick ponies. Tesla needs to focus on building a quality product, taking care of its customers, and profitability -- not accelerating away from its issues at breakneck velocities.

Is that fair?

Tesla's ""Ludicrous Mode"" serves its larger mission

I think Harley went a little too far. Tesla's ""Ludicrous Mode"" and emphasis on acceleration is part of its larger mission to show that electric cars can be better than gasoline-powered alternatives. It's fun, it gets attention, it works.

That said, it's true Tesla has a long way to go before it's genuinely competitive with other luxury-performance brands in the other aspects of ""high performance"" that matter to driving enthusiasts.

Some of those brands are gearing up to fight back. Eliciting that reaction might also be part of Tesla's larger mission.

Tesla's moves are provoking rivals -- perhaps deliberately?

Tesla's feats are spurring some of those other brands into action. Consider these comments from an unnamed Porsche executive in the June issue of Automobile Magazine:

The thing about [Tesla's] Ludicrous mode is that it's a facade. Two launches saps the whole battery. That won't be the case with the Mission E [Porsche's upcoming electric sports sedan]. You'll be able to run it hard, over and over; the battery will not overheat, the power control module will not overheat, and the seats will [be better than Tesla's].

Some of that is just trash talk, but the takeaway is clear: When it comes to electric high-performance cars, Porsche is out to show Tesla how it's done.

Porsche isn't alone: We know Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) are all developing electric vehicles aimed directly at Tesla's offerings.

And there's a very good chance there are others in development that we don't know about. Don't be surprised if a company like General Motors (NYSE:GM) or Nissan surprises us with a very capable electric sports sedan or sports car sometime in the next few months.

It's possible (more than possible, in the case of Porsche) that some of these offerings will embarrass Teslas on the world's racetracks. Even so, we'll have to give Musk props: Provoking some of the world's proudest performance-car makers looks likely to lead to more great electric cars, and that has been Tesla's goal all along."

RELATED: Electric cars will be big in 2017 model year

It's a dramatic incremental victory for Tesla in Texas, the nation's second-largest auto market, coming less than a year after the state's top Republican, Gov. Greg Abbott, told Bloomberg that Texas wasn't interested in the California car company's direct sales.

The debate, which surfaced officially in the last two legislative session, saw the full fury of Texas car dealers unleashed, and pit principles of conservative economics against each other.

When leaders herald a competitive marketplace with slim state control, what do they do when retailers ask for state control to maintain competition?

Since 2013, Tesla sought an exemption from state regulations that require its luxury automobiles be sold at franchised dealerships. There isn't much of a parallel elsewhere in the retail unvierse -imagine a law requiring laptop computers be sold at designated retailers like Best Buy or Micro Center. Tesla wanted to open the equivalent of an Apple Store—a single-brand shop with factory-direct merchandise—like they have opened in other states.

The Texas Franchise Law outlawed that, so Tesla in Texas ran ""galleries,"" not stores, where employees could show the cars but not discuss their prices, or even give the web address where customers could order a Tesla from a California factory.

RELATED: Tesla opens up gallery and service center in Houston

Tesla founder Elon Musk, who also started Paypall and SpaceX, took his qualms to Texas lawmakers in 2013. Advocates for Texas car dealers argued that Tesla's request amounted to an unfair exemption for a single player.

Indeed, the bill filed by Rep. Eddie Rodrigues (D-Austin) carved out an exception for ""a manufacturer of only all electric-powered or all battery-powered motor vehicles"" which already operated dealerships elsewhere in the U.S. and never used a franchised retailer. That pretty narrowly singled out Tesla without mentioning the name.

That bill passed committee but never made it to vote. A 2013 report from the watchdog group Texans for Public Justice credited the failure to high dollar contributions from auto dealers to state lawmakers.

When the 2015 session came around, the issue reemerged and both sides upped their game. Tesla increased its spending on lobbying efforts from about $350,000 in 2013 to $1.5 million in 2015

Car dealers upped their spending even more, according to a 2015 report by Texans for Public Justice, doling out $6 million in campaign contributions during the 2014 cycle.

As the Tesla issue caught traction in the 2015 session, the Texas Automobile Dealers Association issued a ""myth vs. fact"" explainer.

""MYTH: Franchise laws contradict the free market,"" it said. ""FACT: Franchise laws were put in place to prevent monopolies and promote competition in vehicle pricing and service to the consumer.""

Texas car dealers argued that a Tesla exemption would open the door for all manufacturers to monopolize direct sales in Texas, and would pave the path towards certain doom for the franchised dealership industry.

The legislation, this time with bipartisan backing, stalled in committee.

RELATED: Tesla bills in reverse at the Texas Legislature

The coming 2017 session seems poised to provide a breakthrough for Tesla, now that the company has courted the sentiments of Texas republicans.

With a booth at the party's state convention in Dallas in May, a Tesla rep argued that repeal of franchise law amounted to a truer free market system. And the party agreed, adding a Tesla-friendly plank to its 2016 platform.

""We support allowing consumers in Texas to be able to purchase cars directly from manufacturers,"" the addition said.

That will make it very hard for the state's ruling party to continue to resist the years-long push when lawmakers convene again in Austin in January.

If a franchise exemption passes for Tesla in Texas, consumers will face the fresh opportunity to walk into a Tesla gallery and drive out in one of the world's foremost models of luxury electric sedans. It will probably prompt the opening of more Tesla storefronts across Texas, and could help push electric vehicle travel into the mainstream."

As it turns out, I've driven all of Tesla's cars, and I went for a brief ride in a prototype of the Model 3 earlier this year.

They each have their own cool features, but they all share numerous aspects — stuff that you get on each and every Tesla.

Here's a breakdown:"
http://fortune.com/2017/01/19/teslas-autopilot-tech-safer-nhtsa-report/,pos,1.0,8.053582413749434e-15,Tesla's Autopilot Tech Has Made Its Cars 40% Safer,2017-01-19 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:42:09.758531,Kirsten Korosec,"The six-month federal investigation into a fatal accident involving a Tesla using its semi-autonomous Autopilot system has done more than exonerate the automaker. It provides the first federal evaluation of Autopilot as well as some insight into how Tesla designed and developed it.

And while these insights are an important validation of Tesla’s technology (more on that below), in a way they’re already outdated.

As of October, new Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles are equipped with what the company calls Hardware 2—a more robust suite of sensors, cameras, and radar and software that will enable them to (eventually) drive autonomously—without human intervention. The important word here is eventually.

Tesla customers can now order either “Enhanced Autopilot” or “Full Self-Driving Capability,” when they buy a new car. Vehicles with this the full self-driving ability will have eight cameras (not the standard four), ultrasonic sensors, radar, and a supercomputer capable of processing data 40 times faster than previously.

The Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system isn’t yet active in these new cars. That will change this weekend when an over-the-air software update will bring Autopilot capabilities into the cars. Once this occurs, Tesla vehicles with “Hardware 1” and “Hardware 2” will have the same Autopilot functionality.

Every few months, Tesla will roll out new automated features to the Hardware 2-equipped vehicles as they are validated. Ultimately, and as regulations allow, Tesla vehicles with the “full self-driving package” will be able to take a drive from home to work and find a parking space on its own. Owners can always upgrade to this software package.

Now back to the report.

Tesla’s Crash Rate Dropped Nearly 40%

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration focused on four areas as part of its investigation: automatic emergency braking, how drivers interact with Autopilot, data from crash incidents involving Tesla vehicles, and changes the company has made to its systems.

NHTSA didn’t find any defects that would require a recall. Instead, the agency found data that supports Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s assertions that Autopilot is preventing accidents and even saving lives.

Investigators found that Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40% after Autosteer—one component of the Autopilot system—became available. The investigation analyzed model year 2014 through 2016 Model S and 2016 Model X vehicles equipped with Autopilot. The crash rates compare airbag deployment crashes before and after Autosteer installation.

Courtesy of NHTSA

Musk, was of course, quick to tweet out the positive news.

Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.” — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 19, 2017

Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that actually includes a number of features such as traffic-aware cruise control (TACC) and Autosteer.

Autosteer uses information from the forward-looking camera, the radar sensor, and the ultrasonic sensors, to detect lane markings as well as the presence of vehicles and objects. The aim is to automatically keep Tesla vehicles within the lane.

Autopilot (And other Automatic Emergency Braking Tech) Has Its Limitations



This might seem obvious. And yet, the confidence in Autopilot by users has caused some to test it beyond its intended capabilities. As Autopilot was rolled out there was no shortage of YouTube videos of owners pushing the system beyond its limits.

The investigation highlights one important limitation on any vehicle with automatic emergency braking, which includes Tesla. Automatic emergency braking systems “are rear-end collision avoidance technologies that are not designed to reliably perform in all crash modes, including crossing path collisions,” the report says.

The new Tesla vehicles equipped with Hardware 2 should resolve this weakness because the sensor, radar, and camera-laden cars will have 360-degree view of the world around them.

Tesla Expected Misuse

The federal report says Tesla appears to have anticipated misuse and designed the system around that expectation.

For instance, Tesla’s design included a hands-on the steering wheel system for monitoring driver engagement, the report says. Tesla has since added another layer of safety to the system by instituting a “strike out” strategy. Drivers that do not respond to visual cues in the driver monitoring system alerts may lose Autopilot function for the remainder of the drive cycle.

With the rise of autonomy in vehicles, the job of a designer just became more important than ever."

Tesla said the “brief, planned” pause would allow the company to add capacity to the existing paint shop to prepare it for the Model 3, and other general maintenance.

“This will allow Tesla to begin Model 3 production later this year as planned and enable us to start the ramp towards 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018,” said a Tesla spokesman.

He added that the pause was not expected to have a material impact on first-quarter production or delivery figures, as the company had added production days to compensate.

Separately, sources told Reuters that the luxury electric carmaker planned to begin test-building the Model 3 on Feb. 20.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last year told investors and more than 370,000 customers who put deposits down for a Model 3 that he intended to start building the cars in July 2017. At the time, many analysts and suppliers said the timeline was too ambitious and would be difficult to achieve, pointing to Tesla’s history of missing aggressive production targets.

If Tesla succeeds in starting pilot production of the sedan at its factory in Fremont, California on Feb. 20, as people familiar with the matter told Reuters, the company would be able to share the news with shareholders two days later when it reports fourth-quarter results and better answer any questions about the Model 3 rollout.

‘STOKE THE FAN BASE’

The sources did not know how many of the highly anticipated vehicles Tesla aimed to build in February, but it would likely be a small number to test the assembly system and the quality of vehicle parts.

“What better way to stoke the fan base and Wall Street than to wheel out pre-production models” ahead of the earnings announcement, said one person familiar with Tesla’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Tesla spokesman declined to comment on the company’s production schedule.

Musk had told investors last year that the company could miss the July 2017 startup target if suppliers do not meet deadlines.

Tesla has a lot riding on the Model 3, which is priced at roughly $35,000 before government incentives. If successful, the sedan could raise Tesla beyond a niche luxury player in the automotive sector.

Tesla has not had a profitable year since going public in 2010, though the company’s $41.4 billion market capitalization now equals that of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T), which reported a profit of $4.7 billion last year.

Musk’s bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla, but skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year by 2018.

That would expand Tesla’s annual production by four to five times compared to 2016 levels. In its fourth quarter, Tesla produced 24,882 vehicles.

Tesla disclosed in May that it had taken 373,000 refundable $1,000 deposits for the Model 3, underscoring its appeal ahead of production. The company has not since updated that number. Total sales of fully electric vehicles last year in the United States amounted to just 84,275 vehicles, according to data compiled by the Electric Drive Transportation Association.

MOVING DESIGN TARGET

Sources with knowledge of the Model 3 timeline had called it extremely aggressive, with challenges compounded by Tesla making last-minute changes to the car’s design. Such design tweaks can delay production, and add cost as suppliers rework tools and molds to meet new specifications.

Musk said in July the design of the Model 3 was complete. The car, he told shareholders earlier in May, would be “easy to make” and free of the complicated design that led to production delays in the Model X sports utility vehicle.

It is common practice for automakers to make minor adjustments to a “finished” design for a variety of reasons, ranging from fit and finish to safety.

One source said last week that design changes were still underway for the Model 3, which could potentially hinder the ramp-up to full production. Tesla declined to comment on whether the design was still being tinkered with.

Tesla’s previous launches for the Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle were marked by production delays and initial quality issues.

That track record meant some analysts were skeptical that Musk would launch production by July. “We assume 0 Model 3 deliveries in ‘17,” Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a Jan. 3 note, while Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas in a Jan. 19 note said he expected a “soft launch” of the Model 3 to be delayed until late 2017."

Tesla’s name has been tied to electric vehicles (EVs) ever since the company unveiled it’s pioneer product, the Tesla Roadster. But even with the title “Tesla Motors Inc.,” the company has never been shy about their ambitious plans to reach far beyond electric cars. Since it was founded in 2003, Tesla has become so much more. Therefore, it’s fitting that the company moved to officially change their name to Tesla Inc.

Ostensibly, all the company really did was drop a single word from their original name. However, it’s a move that signifies how a brand can stay true to its heritage, and continue to forge a new path towards what Elon Musk called the “solar electric economy” of the future, which he mentioned in the first half of his Master Plan back in 2006.

When Musk was placed at the helm of the company, Tesla was already reeling from the effects of the financial crisis. But amid cutbacks, layoffs, and missed launch dates, the company was able to secure $40 million that helped Tesla avoid bankruptcy. By 2009, Tesla introduced the Model S, their first electric sedan. By mid 2010, Tesla went public for $17 per share.

Towards the end of 2011, Tesla unveiled the Model X prototype, simultaneous with deliveries of the Model S, which finally made it to the market. In 2014, Tesla open-sourced its patents for EVs. Beyond being an unprecedented move from a private, for-profit company, this demonstrated the company’s commitment to their master plan – to make sustainable transport accessible to all.

The Future of Tesla

The construction of Tesla’s Gigafactory in 2014 marked Tesla’s steady path toward realizing its ultimate vision. Once the factory becomes fully operational (hopefully by 2020), this will allow the company to bring down the cost of their batteries by 30 percent, thus lowering the price of the Model 3. That same year, Tesla announced their semi-autonomous driving system, Autopilot.

2015 saw the arrival of the Model X and Autopilot in the market, but more notably, it was a milestone for the company’s foray outside of car manufacturing. The introduction of the Powerwall and the Powerpack marked Tesla’s first big push into energy.

The following year, Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity reignited talk of where exactly Tesla was headed – but it wasn’t long after that Musk revealed the second half of his masterplan, where he confirmed Tesla’s new objectives. Not only was Tesla set to introduce more affordable EVs, and make self-driving technology a reality, but the company was also going to start building solar roofs to seamlessly integrate with Tesla’s battery storage.

As Musk himself stated in the second half of his masterplan:

The point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good. That’s what ‘sustainable’ means. It’s not some silly, hippy thing – it matters for everyone.

Quite simply, Tesla Motors Inc., was a means to an end—a way to prompt an entire industry of gas-guzzling, carbon-emitting car manufacturers to recognize the need to follow the company’s sustainable transportation model. And now, with Tesla, Inc., we can look forward to a truly sustainable future defined by Tesla’s core vision."

As the late-July launch of Tesla's make-or-break mass-market Model 3 sedan neared, CEO Elon Musk allowed himself an unguarded moment on Twitter: ""The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress,"" he wrote, momentarily agreeing with speculation that he might even be bipolar, before adding that he didn't literally mean it. ""When you buy a ticket to hell, you can't blame hell.'' The moment illustrates that even world-changing entrepreneurs like Musk battle stress. And having an irreplaceable, overstretched founder is a legitimate concern for any fast-growing business if there is no strong team in place as a backup should something happen to the visionary leader. ""When it's your own money, fine,"" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ""When you take other people's money or public capital, the obligations change.'' Even so, many of the management challenges Tesla faces as it morphs from a niche automaker into a global renewable-energy one-stop shop apply to less-exalted businesses, from small manufacturers to midsized service companies. Management experts have a playbook for scaling up management of growing companies, and Tesla is learning similar lessons on the fly. And in some cases the company isn't there yet, by textbook standards. But the company is taking key steps on its path to growth. Most notably, it has locked and loaded Musk in an incentives-based compensation plan that gives him a low salary, no cash bonus or incentives until he hits targets related to stock price and brings products to market. Tesla also added independent board members in July to diversify its brain trust. Here are important steps every company should take to ensure there is no disruption in business if something should happen to their most important asset: the visionary founder and CEO.

1. Have a succession plan.

With Musk only 46, Tesla can be forgiven for not planning much for when he's not around — but Apple's Steve Jobs was 49 when he got his first cancer diagnosis, years after he hired his eventual successor Tim Cook as Apple's operations chief. Life comes at people fast, and business leaders need to prepare more than most people, said Andrew Sherman, a Washington-based partner at law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP. ""Not doing it not only puts the founders' families at risk but also people who work there and the whole supplier ecosystem,"" Sherman said. A plan can also bridge gaps between baby-boomer business owners and millennials who will help run the business soon, he said. Musk has said he expects to be around Tesla for years to come. He has even joked about succession, as when he was asked if he would go on a Mars space mission through his SpaceX rocket company. ""I'd have to have a really good succession plan, because the likelihood of death is very high,"" he told a questioner after a 2016 speech. ""And I'd like to see my kids grow up and everything.''

2. Have key-executive insurance.

If Tesla has coverage on Musk, it's not disclosed in the company's annual 10-K report to the Securities and Exchange Commission — or in its yearly proxy statement, which discloses executive pay (Tesla declined to add detail). Experts say that's OK for Tesla — Musk's value runs into the billions of dollars, so he'd be all but impossible to insure for what he's worth. But for more-mortal executives running prosaic businesses, it's a must.

""It's usually correlated more with closely held partnerships,"" said Stuart Tauber, partner at corporate insurance consultant Meltzer Group. Key-exec plans can protect either the company or the families of founding partners, Tauber said. If an owner's family doesn't want to stay involved in the business, it's common to buy enough insurance to let surviving partners buy them out. Alternatively, the insurance can pay the company for hiring and paying a replacement, or reimburse for value lost when a partner dies, Tauber said. A million dollars of life insurance coverage can typically be had for about $1,000 a year, with another $5,000 to insure against disability, Tauber said. Policies should also be revisited every few years as roles different executives play in a business change, he added.

3. Put in place a well-rounded executive team.

How well Tesla has done on this is a matter of debate. One sore point is that perceptions of Tesla's quality has slipped since the initial Model S's rave reviews — a J.D. Power report this year said fit and finish of recent models isn't competitive with BMW and Mercedes. (That contradicted a December 2016 Consumer Reports survey that rated Tesla's customer satisfaction the industry's highest, a company spokeswoman noted.) Analysts, short sellers and CNBC's Jim Cramer have also noted Tesla's propensity to miss production forecasts and push deadlines for new products. But a fleshed-out management team is essential to business continuity planning if the boss gets sick or injured — and it will keep everyone sane even when the boss is healthy, Sherman said. Tesla works without a COO, and Musk's manufacturing knowledge was mostly learned on the job, at Tesla and his SpaceX rocket company, where he is also CEO. (In May 2016, Tesla confirmed it had hired Audi veteran Peter Hochholdinger as vice president of manufacturing.) SpaceX has a president and COO, Gwynne Shotwell, despite being a fraction of Tesla's size. Tesla's investor-relations website only bills three executives — Musk, chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja and chief technical officer JB Straubel — as corporate officers. Combined with Musk's obsession with getting details right, strains on management have contributed to Musk's keeping a sleeping bag at Tesla's factory as production deadlines approach.

That's a recipe for a stressed-out boss, Sherman said, though many companies don't specifically have a COO. One point of being the boss is being able to enjoy success — including taking vacations sometimes, knowing the business works when the CEO's away, Sherman said. More from iCONIC:

I think my main — the most valuable thing I could contribute — is kind of product design and technology, but that's my forte; that's what I like doing, and that's what I imagine doing in the sort of very long term.""

4. Communicate the plan to everyone on your team — employees, customers, investors and lenders.

Even Tesla admirers give the company relatively low marks here. ""I don't have any notion of how their bench strength is,"" said Theodore O'Neill, an analyst at Ascendiant Capital Markets. ""It would be better for them if they were more transparent."" At Tesla, lack of clarity about the team leads to Musk facing questions about management turnover, which he said on Tesla's second-quarter earnings call is less than at comparable companies. (The question came amid departures, including the company's former chief financial officer and the head of its autonomous-car research effort.) Many companies put off this planning and communication and even get away with it. By most measures, Tesla has — it's built a $60 billion market cap and is expected to boost sales next year to $20 billion as Model 3 production scales up, from $11.8 billion in 2017. ""People with car experience have been pooh-poohing Elon Musk for 15 years and been proven wrong,"" O'Neill said. But at big companies like Apple, down to more mundane businesses that turn to lawyers like Sherman, careful planning lets workers and partners breathe easier and plan their own futures. ""It's a good governance approach that also pays cultural dividends,"" Sherman said. — By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com"

Presented by: Red Cloud Klondike Strike (Equity crowdfunding in mining)

The Tesla Model S is the world’s most-wanted electric car, with 100,000 units already sold as of December 2015.

Critics have lauded the car for its impressive safety rating, range, and design. However, it is also worth considering that it is the incredible raw materials that go into the Tesla Model S that help to make all of these things possible.

Here’s what’s in a Tesla Model S:

Body and Chassis

Bauxite: The Tesla Model S body and chassis are built almost entirely from aluminum, which comes from bauxite ore. Aluminum is lightweight, which helps to maximize the range of the battery beyond that of other EVs. The total amount of aluminum used in the car is 410 lbs (190 kg).

Boron steel: High-strength boron steel is used to reinforce the aluminum at critical safety points. Boron steel is made from iron, boron, coking coal, and other additives.

Titanium: The underbody of the Tesla Model S is made from ultra high-strength titanium, which protects the battery from nearly any roadside force or piercing.

Interior

Rare Earth Metals: While Tesla engines and batteries do not use rare earths, most high-end car speakers and other electronics use rare earth elements such as neodymium magnets.

Plastic: Most plastics are made from petrochemicals.

Leather: Leather is derived from animal skin, mainly cowhides .

Silicon: Glass windows and other features are made from silicon.

Carbon fiber and copper wire are also used within the interior for various components.

Wheels

Bauxite: Aluminum alloy wheels are also made from bauxite ore.

Rubber: Natural rubber comes from rubber trees, but today 70% of US rubber is synthetic, made from petrochemicals.

Induction Engine:

Copper: Tesla’s high-performance copper rotor motor delivers 300 horsepower and weighs 100 lbs (45.4 kg).

Steel: The stationary piece of the engine, the stator, is made from both copper and steel.

Battery:

The Tesla battery pack weighs 1,200 lbs (540 kg), which is equal to about 26% of the car’s total weight. This puts the car’s center of gravity a mere 44.5 centimeters off the ground, giving the car unprecedented stability.

The battery itself contains 7,104 lithium-ion battery cells. Here’s what’s in each cell:

Cathode: The Tesla Model S battery cathode uses an NCA formulation with the approximate ratio: 80% nickel, 15% cobalt, and 5% aluminum. Small amounts of lithium are also used in the cathode.

Anode: The negative terminal uses natural or synthetic graphite to hold lithium ions. Small amounts of silicon are also likely used in the anode as well.

Electrolyte: The electrolyte is made of a lithium salt.

Copper and/or aluminum foil is also used in the battery as well.

Note: all numbers above are based on the 85 kWh battery model.

And the move, though simple, was a brilliant lesson in leadership.

Monday, Nikki Sylianteng asked Musk via Twitter whether what she thought was the omission of a mirror on the passenger side sun visor was ""intentional or an oversight."" She was trying to do her makeup in the passenger seat and couldn't find it.

Musk, the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted back, assuring her it was there and directing her how to locate it.

Sylianteng was elated to hear from the billionaire tech executive — and to find the mirror. ""Woo thanks!"" she replied.

Musk's communicatin elicited other impressed responses. ""Amazing customer support!"" tweeted Nitin Alabur. ""Wow, Best CEO. You need to sleep. Goodnight,"" says Evelyn Janeidy. ""You know the product is great when the CEO himself solves customer problems. Not your average CEO. Mad respect!"" says Salman Pasha.

It's not the first time Musk has tweeted support to Tesla customers.

In September, Musk responded to a potential Tesla customer who was unhappy with a sales representative he had encountered in the Stanford, Calif., store.

According to Musk, he's frequently in the trenches at Tesla in many different ways. On a conference call about the company's most recent quarterly financial report, Musk said he doesn't even have a desk, he goes to where the problem is.

""I always move my desk to wherever — well, I don't really have a desk, actually. I move myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla,"" said Musk. He has also talked about being on at the Gigafactory, helping diagnose calibration issues until 2 a.m.

""I really believe that one should lead from the front lines and that's why I'm here,"" he said.

A boss's willingness to respond to individual customers can go a long way. Employees are much happier at work if they know their manager has the skill set to do what they are asking their employee to do. That's according to research that focused on 35,000 randomly selected employees and workplaces in the U.S. and Britain, highlighted by the Harvard Business Review in 2016.

""Even we were surprised by the size of the measured effect,"" the authors remark in a piece penned for the Harvard Business Review. ""For instance, among American workers, having a technically competent boss is considerably more important for employee job satisfaction than their salary (even when pay is really high).""

The strategy seems to be working for Musk. Space X and Tesla both top the charts of tech companies top talent wants to work for, according to a recent survey conducted by job website, Hired.

Timothy Artman/Tesla

Tesla is doubling down on its customer service efforts as it ramps up production for the new Model 3.

Jon McNeill, Tesla's president of sales and services, said owners can now escalate their problems directly to executives in the Tesla Motors Club forum, Electrek first reported.

McNeill encouraged Tesla owners to still explore traditional customer service or repair channels, but said owners can now use a new Executive Escalation feature through their Tesla account.

Those who own a Tesla report high satisfaction with the brand, according to a 2016 Consumer Reports Owner Satsifaction survey.

Some customers, however, have complained about Tesla's sales and services channels.

Tesla doesn't rely on a dealership network, cutting down on the number of people who can walk a customer through the purchasing process.

Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein Research analyst and Model X owner, wrote in a note that, based on his own limited experience, this could pose issues with the rollout of Tesla's Model 3, which has a large backorder.

""We believe that any shortfalls in Tesla's customer experience for Model 3 could have a significant impact on its powerful brand, potentially resulting in order cancellations and undermining its high customer satisfaction,"" the note reads, according to Fortune.

There have been some reports that Tesla is slow to respond to emails or calls regarding service issues, but complaints vary.

For example, some Tesla owners told Automotive News in November that wait times at Tesla's service centers stretched for weeks following the release of the Model X, which was plagued with issues during its initial release. But respondents in a 2016 Consumer Reports survey said Tesla delivered rapid repairs.

Alain Cohen, a Tesla owner, sued the company when it allegedly stopped responding to his calls and emails about repairs for his vehicle.

A Tesla spokesperson said that most of Cohen's issues were fixed under warranty at no additional expense. The issues that weren't fixed had to do with Cohen not bringing the vehicle to a service center for repairs.

""Tesla consistently achieves the highest customer satisfaction ratings of any auto manufacturer because we do everything we can to ensure owners have the best possible experience,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Tesla's website currently lists 72 service centers in the United States. It had 130 service vans to assist with repairs as of early July.

Tesla is making moves to further improve its customer service as it ramps up Model 3 production. In addition to the new Executive Escalation feature, Tesla said in July it will roll out 350 additional service vans and 100 new service centers."

AP Photo/Justin Pritchard Tesla's cars are technologically impressive.

They're very fast, they can all but drive themselves, they can be summoned from a garage with no one at the wheel, and they are routinely improved by software updates over-the-air that allow owners to go to sleep and wake up with a new car in the driveway.

Everyone in the auto industry now grudgingly admits that Tesla has forever altered consumers' expectations for how advanced in-car tech should be.

But Tesla's most advanced feature is largely hidden — and will need to undergo a big change in the coming years if the electric-car maker hopes to realize the far-reaching vision of CEO Elon Musk.

It's the batteries, stupid

The secret sauce at the core of Tesla's disruption of the traditional car business is its unique battery design (and the powertrain software than manages how the electricity is delivered to the vehicles' electric motors). Tesla takes thousands of lithium-ion battery cells and wires them together to make a pack that can serve up well over 200 miles of range.

Tesla's battery packs give its cars range that's on par with gas-powered vehicles. And, as an aside, scorching performance (the Model S P90D with ""Ludicrous Mode"" is as fast as Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche supercars).

But that range comes at a price. Two prices, really. Economically, Tesla's battery packs are the most expensive part of its cars. Physically, the packs are also large and heavy. What this means is that Teslas need enough power to move themselves around before they can even think about range or acceleration.

Lithium-ion batteries also rely on ... lithium, which is a limited, costly resource that is currently in wide demand not just for electric cars, but also for pretty much all the rechargeable consumer electronic gadgets on Earth.

This is why Tesla is building a massive battery factory with Panasonic in Nevada; if the automaker is going to deliver 500,000 cars annually by 2018, it's going to need something on the order of 4 billion individual Li-ion cells every single year.

The core problem here isn't actually that daunting number — it's the power threshold that Li-ion is now approaching, in terms of battery chemistry. Simply put, the chemistry of Li-ion can't ultimately provide the range that a very fuel-efficient, all-gas-powered or hybrid-gas-electric vehicle can.

The solution is to add more cells, something that Tesla has done since it was founded, but that's a slippery slope. A smart car maker would be exploring new battery designs, powered by different chemistries.

Tesla's early bet

Tesla bet big on its battery design in the early days enabled the company to have a long-range EV before anyone else. Most EVs from traditional automakers top out at around 100 miles on a charge. Tesla's competitors have also looked to battery pack designs that aren't as complex, and that don't require thousands of individual Li-ion cells.

Clearly, Tesla made the right choice. But now it has to make another choice: Stick with Li-ion, or prepare for a shift to a newer, better battery chemistry.

Several cheaper designs that promise better range on a single charge are on the horizon, but they aren't ready for prime time. Over the next decade, however, they probably will be.

But Tesla will be running the Gigafactory in Nevada flat-out by then, manufacturing batteries that are no longer state-of-the-art. Tesla will also be a 20-year-old company by that time — not a nimble startup capable of turning on a dime, nor a vast, global manufacturing company capable of plunging resources into a post-Li-ion battery future.

It's never too late, until it is

Tesla can still come out on top, if it retains flexibility both with its vehicle designs and at the Gigafactory. A battery is just a battery, and there may come a day when Tesla decides to become more like a modern automobile manufacturer, assembling vehicles from parts entirely supplied by other companies (today's major car makers are really design, marketing, logistics, and financing firms). Tesla is actually doing the opposite, bringing parts production in-house to control quality.

If Musk and his team are thinking that the Gigafactory can, long term, build any type of battery, then the future could still be bright.

But if the Gigafactory is really just an all-in lithium-ion gamble, then Tesla's now-innovative vehicles will eventually be surpassed by cheaper, longer-range cars that will make profitable use of a superior ""fueling"" source.

None of this, of course, takes into account a far larger threat: that gas-powered cars will never go away, or that something better than electricity, with all the limits that recharging batteries presents, will appear. Musk called hydrogen fuel-cells ""fool cells,"" but that's only because hydrogen, if it can be cleanly produced, is a much better option than electricity.

The only byproduct is water, the vehicles use electric motors (and could presumably have Tesla-like performance), and the fueling infrastructure is already in place; its called ""gas stations.""

At some point, Tesla will have to grapple with the strategic question of how its cars are powered. Unfortunately, even though the company is much more stable than it was five years ago, it's still unable to afford any major course corrections. But that may be exactly what it's up against by 2020."

The line includes the Model S luxury sedan, starting at about $71,500, and the seemingly Mars-ready sport utility vehicle (Model X), which starts at about $83,000.

“I’m supercurious about the self-driving feature,” Ms. Nonoo said, referring to Tesla’s autopilot function, a sort of “Jetsons”-age cruise control that allows drivers to remove their hands from the wheel, as well as their feet from the pedals, while built-in radar, 360-degree ultrasonic sonar and image-recognizing cameras guide the car through traffic."

The carmakers that Tesla has challenged in market capitalization in 2017 — General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — have each amassed war chests. FCA has almost $20 billion, GM has nearly $25 billion, and Ford has socked away close to $40 billion.

Tesla has just over $3 billion

Tesla is also currently burning through over a billion per quarter. If we just go by cash and exclude other financing instruments, such as Tesla's revolving credit lines, the company can't make it through 2018.

It's worth noting that Tesla is running thin on cash at a time when the US economy is at full employment and the US auto market is running near an all-time sales high.

Do the math: Tesla needs more money. And it will likely obtain that funding through another capital raise. It's past two raises were a return to Wall Street to sell more stock; and a first foray into the junk-bond debt markets.

The smart money, such as it is, would likely bet on Tesla doing another equity raise in 2018, given that shares are still above $300. Each new raise, however, highlights Tesla's poor execution on the manufacturing front. FCA, Ford, and GM also spend a billion per quarter, but they manage to produce millions of vehicles worldwide. Tesla produces a fraction of that.

There is an assumption among Tesla bulls that this pattern will at some point reverse in the future, as the Model 3 sedan, priced to start at $35,000, ramps toward full production and Tesla starts to draw in revenue from something like 400,000 pre-orders.

But while that would be cause for celebration at Tesla, attention would then turn to how much money Tesla is making on the Model 3. Mass-market sedans have notoriously skinny profit margins and have plummeted in popularity as consumers have turned to crossover SUVs.

There's no question that cash will be Tesla's biggest challenge in 2018."

Baker + Business Reporter + Follow David R. On + Https + Www.Facebook.Com Sfchronicle + Past Articles This Author + New York Times + Trisha Thadani + Ashley Mcbride + Rachel Swan,"Without attracting much notice, Tesla Motors has become one of Silicon Valley’s biggest property holders, its collection of facilities not far behind the sprawling campuses of Apple and Google.

And as Tesla accelerates production of its luxury electric cars, analysts say, it’s probably going to need even more space. After making about 50,500 vehicles at its Fremont factory in 2015, the company now plans to build 1 million per year by 2020.

“When you’re ramping up production, you’re moving a tremendous amount of stock, and you need room for that,” said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor of Kelley Blue Book’s website.

According to Tesla’s most recent annual report, the company owns or leases about 6.6 million square feet in the Bay Area, most of that located at its 5.4 million-square-foot factory and its 350,000-square-foot headquarters in Palo Alto. The company also leases two sizable Fremont sites just south of the factory, including one formerly occupied by doomed solar startup Solyndra.

But property records compiled by the CoStar Group, a real-estate data company, count almost 8.3 million square feet owned or leased by Tesla in the Bay Area.

That total lumps in Tesla stores and service centers. But it also includes two large, leased facilities — together adding 1 million square feet — that Tesla will soon open in Livermore. The company has not disclosed what the Livermore facilities will do.

By CoStar’s count, only two Silicon Valley tech companies own or lease more Bay Area real estate than Tesla. Apple ranks first, with 11.1 million square feet, followed by Google with 10.9 million. Cisco Systems comes close with 6.7 million square feet owned or leased in the Bay Area.

Tesla has amassed its constellation of properties as it has grown from a startup offering a limited-production sports car — most of it built elsewhere, on contract — to a full-fledged manufacturer.

Its Fremont plant cranks out two car models, with another due next year. When the company moved into the plant, formerly run by a joint venture of General Motors and Toyota, Tesla occupied just a small corner of the vast structure, not even bothering to light the rest. Today, the company uses the whole plant.

But even in the joint venture’s heyday — when the plant was known as New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. — the factory never built more than 428,632 vehicles in a year. To reach 1 million, Tesla will either have to expand the plant or move some of its functions to other sites, DeLorenzo said.

Other facilities could be used to store parts or assemble systems that can then be incorporated into cars on the factory’s production line.

“They’ll need a lot more technical support, so some of these buildings may end up being engineering, quality control — people who are supporting the factory but don’t necessarily have to be on the factory floor,” DeLorenzo said.

CEO Elon Musk has discussed opening other auto plants elsewhere, and the company is already making batteries at its massive new Gigafactory near Reno. But Musk has also said that Tesla may be able to make 1 million cars per year relying just on the Fremont plant and the Gigafactory.

Tesla has not filed for any city permits to expand the auto factory or open other facilities in Fremont, said Kelly Kline, the city’s economic development director. A Tesla spokeswoman declined to say whether the company is looking for additional Bay Area properties.

Should Tesla need more space, analysts are split on whether the company will continue snapping up local properties or go elsewhere, as it did to build the Gigafactory.

The booming Bay Area may not offer enough of the kinds of properties Tesla needs, said CoStar Managing Director Hans Nordby. Silicon Valley in particular no longer has as much space devoted to research and development, or warehousing or logistics as it once did, he said. Instead, it has offices.

“The lower-value uses get boiled out, and they go elsewhere,” Nordby said. “Thirty years ago, the Bay Area had a lot of R&D properties, and there was actual R&D going on in the building, making things and testing things. And that work has gone to Reno and Shanghai.”

But Tesla has shown a pattern of trying to keep its facilities close at hand, said siting consultant John Boyd. After all, one of the company’s biggest facilities outside the Bay Area, a 430,770-square-foot manufacturing space used for machining aluminum parts, lies in Lathrop, 55 miles northeast of its plant.

“Tesla has an affinity for the Silicon Valley area,” said Boyd, principal of the Boyd Co. “Conventional wisdom up to this point would have suggested they look in Nevada and Arizona for some of the sites they’re developing. But their going to Livermore speaks to their philosophy that it’s not a car company, it’s a high-tech transportation company.”

And the Bay Area does still have some room. City officials in Vallejo, for example, are negotiating with one of Tesla’s potential competitors, electric-car startup Faraday Future, to build a factory on the former Mare Island naval base.

Those talks were facilitated by the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, also known as Go-Biz, that tries to keep manufacturers in the state by offering tax credits and finding suitable sites. Tesla last year won a $15 million tax credit to add 4,500 full-time jobs at its California facilities.

Brook Taylor, the office’s deputy director, would not say whether Go-Biz is working with Tesla to locate any new facilities in the state. But he said his office stays in contact with many of the companies it has helped in the past. And it is actively encouraging electric car companies, awarding tax credits to five electric vehicle manufacturers so far. Those include Tesla, Faraday, Proterra, BYD and Karma Automotive.

“California has quietly been attracting some significant manufacturers in the (electric vehicle) space,” Taylor said.

Tesla Motors Inc. on Monday said it had reached a deal to buy SolarCity Corp. for less than the price it originally proposed, as Elon Musk takes the next step forward with his plan to combine his electric-car and solar-energy companies.

The all-stock deal values SolarCity at about $2.6 billion, with SolarCity stockholders receiving 0.11 share of Tesla for each share of SolarCity, valuing them at $25.83 apiece, according to Friday’s closing prices.

Tesla Motors told the US Senate commerce committee staff it is considering two theories that may explain what led to the 7 May fatal crash that killed a Florida man who was using the car’s Autopilot system, a person familiar with the meeting told Reuters on Friday.



Tesla staff members told congressional aides at a briefing on Thursday that they are still trying to understand the “system failure” that led to the crash, the source said.

Tesla is considering whether the radar and camera input for the vehicle’s automatic emergency braking system failed to detect the truck trailer or the automatic braking system’s radar may have detected the trailer but discounted this input as part of a design to “tune out” structures such as bridges to avoid triggering false braking, the source said.

Joshua Brown was killed when his vehicle drove under the tractor-trailer. It was the first known fatality involving a Model S operating on the Autopilot system that takes control of steering and braking in certain conditions. The accident has increased scrutiny of automated driving technology.

Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, was asked on Twitter about why the radar did not detect the truck. Musk wrote in a 30 June tweet that “radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events”.

A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment on the meeting, referring questions to the company’s recent statements.

Tesla also told committee staffers it views braking failure as separate and distinct from its Autopilot function, which manages steering, changing lanes, and adjusting travel speed, the source said.

On Tuesday, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said its preliminary findings showed the Model S was traveling at 74 miles (119 km) per hour in a 65mph (104 km per hour) zone at the time it struck the semi-truck near Williston, Florida.

The report said the NTSB confirmed the Model S driver was using the advanced driver assistance features Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer lane-keeping assistance at the time. The NTSB has not yet determined the probable cause of the crash.

Tesla faces a separate investigation by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) into whether the system poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. It faces a Friday deadline to answer the safety agency’s initial questions about the crash."

Boudette,"Tesla Motors is readying improvements to its Autopilot technology that might have prevented an accident in May that took the life of an Ohio man, Tesla’s chief executive said on Sunday. The man was killed when his Model S car driving in Autopilot crashed into a tractor-trailer.

The improvements, to be released in the next week or two, include changes that require drivers to refrain from taking their hands off the steering wheel for long periods and more precise use of radar to recognize potential obstacles in the road.

In a conference call with reporters, the head of Tesla, Elon Musk, said he believed the upgrades would have prevented the accident on May 7.

“These things cannot be said with absolute certainty, but we believe it is very likely that, yes, it would have,” he said. The new version of Autopilot, with its improved radar, “would see a large metal object across the road” and be able to determine that the object is not an overpass or overhead road sign that poses no threat, he said. “Impact probability would be assessed as high and it would probably brake.”"

(Andrew Spear/For The Washington Post)

The first Tesla store opened in Columbus, Ohio, 72 miles away. Then one popped up in Cincinnati. Soon, another was in Cleveland. Tesla’s Ohio invasion was swift and — to longtime auto dealers such as Blake Arbogast — a growing threat, creeping ever closer.

In Ohio, dealers sued and lobbied their legislators. One called Tesla’s spread into his territory “Armageddon.” All to no avail. Tesla, the electric-car manufacturer, and its boutique “galleries” are here to stay. The question now: Are traditional dealers?

Tesla, the California company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to not only make electric cars as cool and fast as gas-guzzling sports cars but also to upend the way cars are sold. For generations, automobile manufacturers from Ford to Toyota to General Motors have been banned by state law from selling directly to consumers. Instead, their vehicles are sold by third-party dealers, many of which have deep ties to their community and political leverage.

But Tesla has been steadfastly eroding the traditional model, persuading an increasing number of states to allow it to sell vehicles directly to customers through its boutique stores and even over the Internet. In April, through little more than online viewing galleries, customers committed to buying 400,000 cars they had not seen in person.

Its stores are chic and small. A single model sits in the middle. And unlike Arbogast’s dealership in Troy, Ohio, there’s no lot outside with cars ready for sale.

Now, legacy auto manufacturers, including Arbogast’s supplier, General Motors, are moving toward a future of sales directly from carmaker to driver, industry analysts say. That has triggered a standoff involving dealers, manufacturers and Tesla over the future of car sales, the role of the Internet and whether it is legal to sell a car — often the second-largest purchase in the lifetime of an average American — online.

If other carmakers followed Tesla, “essentially, it would put us out of business,” Arbogast said.

The battles have been breaking out in capitals across the country over laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Arguments have occurred in statehouses in Texas, Ohio, Washington, New Jersey and more than 20 other states, with mixed results. Legislatures want to open up markets for electric vehicles but are wary of undercutting dealers, which are local economic and political engines.

A Missouri judge, for instance, ruled this month in favor of the state’s auto dealers, saying Tesla could continue operating showrooms but could no longer sell cars directly to consumers. The company said it plans to appeal.

Tesla has had notable success, gaining the right to sell in about 20 states, including Washington state and Maryland.

“The reason they’re [Tesla] so successful is because everybody is fed up with the traditional dealership model,” said James Albertine, senior auto analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “If BMW or Audi or Lexus isn’t working on that, then they’re at a loss.”

But it is not yet clear that the disruption of the auto industry will lead to the shuttering of dealerships the way digital sales of music and books led to the death of record stores and bookstores.

Tesla has struggled recently to meet earnings projections, and it posted a $293 million loss last quarter. It has also missed past production deadlines for vehicle orders, which has made investors wary of the company’s rollout of the Model 3, a $35,000 electric vehicle set to come out in 2017.

Auto dealers are widely considered one of the most politically connected groups in the United States. The National Automobile Dealers Association has spent more than $4 million on lobbying since 2015 and year after year is the largest spender in the entire auto industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent research group that tracks political donations. And in the fight for their survival, dealers are not giving up.

Dealers can also bank on their deep ties to their communities, where they have built up name recognition and goodwill, for decades in some cases.

“A franchised auto dealer, they’re involved with all the banks that are around,” said Zach Doran, president of the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association. “They’ve obviously got a significant customer base they’ve built over time. They have a tremendous amount of goodwill they’ve built up with charitable organizations.”

Arbogast sells GMCs and Buicks at a dealership his father started in the 1990s. His cousins own a dealership down the road. Their children are in the business now, too.

He said he is relying on the Troy community and Ohio’s government to see the long-term affects of potentially losing the business. Arbogast employs 220 people in a city of 25,000. He also contributes to local churches and sponsors youth sports teams and schools.

But he is worried about whether his business will be around for another generation of car buyers.

If other manufacturers started selling direct — dealers’ main fear — it could put his business in jeopardy. Arbogast said: “You can only put so much trust in General Motors right now.”

This is not the first time the automotive industry’s analysts have said dealerships such as Arbogast’s could soon be extinct.

Philip Evans and Thomas Wurster wrote in their 1999 book “Blown to Bits” that the new online era meant car dealers were “doomed to destruction.” That same year, a General Motors vice president predicted that 70 percent of his customers would prefer custom online orders.

But that online marketplace model fizzled out. Buyers in the dot-com era did not take to purchasing cars online. They couldn’t get up close and personal with the vehicles. Seeing how the car handles or testing the armrests is impossible to do online.

But today’s consumers have now grown accustomed to buying all sorts of things on the Internet, even cars, no matter that they can’t kick the tires.

“There’s so many guesses you have to make about what consumers will want that it can be more efficient if you let the customers build them to order,” said Brian Johnson, a Barclays automotive-industry analyst. “There’s huge logic as to why a different distribution model makes sense.”

Customers don’t like haggling over pricing, dealers say. And they don’t like shopping around looking for the best deal across different dealerships — they want to go to one location, find the car they are looking for and drive it home.

Dealers say they have made substantial changes in everything from their sales practices to how they train staffers to meet those demands.

When Tesla debuted its Model S electric car in 2012, it quickly disrupted the traditional car-sales model. Its Model S sedan starts around $70,000, and with added features can cost about twice as much. The Model X, an SUV, starts around $80,000 and can be just as expensive with added components.

But you don’t find these vehicles at Tesla shops or “galleries.” Aside from a couple of showroom models at small stores for prospective customers to try on, buyers build their vehicles online, customizing everything from the paint color to the interior styling.

That process can happen on a computer or with the help of a salesperson. And customers can arrange test-drives at certain Tesla facilities.

After a $2,500 down payment, the design is sent off to the company’s Fremont, Calif., factory for assembly and is delivered to one of Tesla’s 67 nationwide service centers for pickup two months later.

“It’s fundamentally an idea where if we woke up today, this might be the model that we have” to buy cars, Johnson said.

In 2014, Tesla’s Musk said he would be open to a “hybrid system” of independent dealerships and company stores. But he has since doubled down in legislative battles. Car companies want to see how Tesla fares distributing the more affordably priced Model 3 before starting new distribution channels.

“The dealer groups in this country, they’re strong,” said Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis at Edmunds. “They have a lot of laws in place and have a lot of power. And though Elon Musk is ambitious, it might cause too much trouble for him than it’s worth.”"

Tesla Motors announced today its new Model S P100D model will hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds, thanks to a bigger, 100-kWh battery. That's an upgrade over the P90D's 2.8 seconds, and just one tenth of a second slower than what the million-dollar Ferrari LaFerrari can do. Except that this is a four-door sedan. The P100D version of the Model X SUV will hit 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.

That's the best stomach swirl for the money the auto industry has ever offered, and a terrific example of how much better electric cars are than internal combustion engines at delivering torque. The bigger battery will also offer 315 miles of range (up from just under 300) in the sedan, Tesla says—but not if you spend all your time enjoying that acceleration.

Of course, with great power comes great pricing. Well, great for Tesla, which is charging a base price of $134,500 for its fastest car ever. The P90D with ""ludicrous mode"" starts at $119,500. The Model X with the bigger pack starts at $135,500. If you've ordered a now measly-feeling P90D but haven't gotten it yet, you can upgrade for $10,000. If you're already driving one and now feel utterly lame, you can have the extra power installed, but it'll cost you $20,000.

In June, Tesla introduced the cheaper Model S 60, powered by a 75-kWh pack running software that limits its capacity by 20 percent. Customers who later decide they want more power can hand over $9,000, for which Tesla hits a button to update the car's software and ""unlock"" the battery's extra capability.

It's easy to imagine Tesla will do something similar with this bigger pack, for buyers who aren't quite ready to spend the extra cash. Spend P90D money today, and once the 2.8 second sprint to 60 mph loses its edge, break out the credit card.

Is a 0 to 60 mph time improvement of .3 seconds worth the extra cash? Tesla hopes so, because it says every dollar it can make off its luxury models will help fund its efforts to build the long-awaited, affordable Model 3, which should enter production late next year."

SAN FRANCISCO —In a deal that brings electric cars together with solar power, Tesla Motors shareholders voted Thursday to approve a deal to acquire SolarCity.

The acquisition makes SolarCity, which is the nation's largest manufacturer and installer of solar panels, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla. More than 85% of shares voted were cast in favor of the acquisition.

Tesla (TSLA) shares, which closed up 2.5% at $188.66, rose 1.4% in after hours trading. SolarCity (SCTY) shares rose 2.5% after hours to $20.90.

In adding SolarCity to the portfolio, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla stores would become one-stop shopping emporiums where consumers can purchase solar panels, electricity storage units called Powerwalls and Powerpacks, and a growing suite of electric vehicles.

""We’re trying to make an integrated product, where you can go to Tesla store and just say yes,"" Musk said after the vote. ""It's seamless and you love it.""

Musk added that the company expects to begin producing its new solar panels ""in volume in the summer of next year, but the important thing is the apples-to-apples comparison to a regular roof."" He said SolarCity panels could be priced at, or even slightly below, that of a regular roof, ""and the electricity is just a bonus.""

Traditional solar panels stand out significantly visually on rooftops -- shiny, bulky black panels that aren't necessarily appealing to the eye. Musk's vision involves creating solar panels disguised as shingle or tiles that seamlessly integrate into a roof.

When Musk first announced his intention to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion back in August, it was met with some scrutiny. Musk was SolarCity's largest shareholder and the acquisition seemed like a conflict of interest, especially given that SolarCity's founder, Lyndon Rive, is Musk's cousin.

What's more, some shareholders and analysts questioned whether taking on a mission to get Tesla into the home solar panel market was wise given the challenges facing the company's automotive division. While Tesla's sleek cars have quickly become status symbols, questions remain about the company's profitability as well as its ability to grapple with production snags.

Musk has repeatedly stated that Tesla is on the cusp of vaulting from a maker of niche high-end electric vehicles — its $100,000 Model S and X sedans — to a builder of more mass-market EVs thanks to its forthcoming Model 3 sedan.

Plus, he has an expansive vision: Musk has an ever-expanding vision for his companies, which include SpaceX, a rocketry startup that intends to colonize Mars.

The company plans to increase production tenfold to 500,000 units once the Model 3 comes on line, and it is in the process of building out a massive Gigafactory in the desert east of Reno, Nev., for the purpose of building both battery cells and, eventually, vehicles. The idea is that once Tesla can make its products at scale, profits will follow.

Thursday's shareholder meeting took place at Tesla's main automotive plant in Fremont, just east of San Francisco.

The deal seemed to get a boost recently when it got the endorsement of Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisory firm whose recommendations are often followed by major shareholders in contentious votes.

While the future of solar has yet to take off despite government subsidies and the opportunity for homeowners to sell power back to the grid, Musk is convinced that there are inefficiencies in the system that his company can exploit to help grow the market.

""Assuming we can make a solar roof cost less than a normal roof, then subsidies no longer matter,"" said Musk.

The stock swap deal, worth about $2 billion, caps a tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla. The proposed acquisition of SolarCity, a money-losing installer of residential solar power systems, prompted a 13% fall in Tesla’s share price after Musk outlined the deal in June.

Tesla said the deal was “overwhelmingly” approved by 85% of unaffiliated shareholders. Shares rose 1.3% in after-hours trade after gaining 4.7% in the regular session to close at $188.66.

“Your faith will be rewarded,” Musk told shareholders assembled at the company’s Fremont, Calif. facility.

Tesla investors have also been rattled by a federal investigation of the death of a Tesla owner operating his car on Autopilot, a driver assistance system, and by concerns Musk may be overextended between ambitious future goals for Tesla (tsla), the work of integrating SolarCity (scty), and his CEO duties at SpaceX.

The automaker’s shares are down nearly 20 percent for the year, and took a hit after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. A key Trump advisor on environmental issues, Myron Ebell, has said federal tax subsidies for electric vehicles should be cut off.

Tesla faces more challenges in the months ahead, as the company tries to make a five-fold leap in its annual vehicle production and launch next year its new Model 3 sedan, aimed at mass-market customers able to buy a vehicle with a starting price of $35,000.

Tesla last month reported a narrow profit for the third quarter, and Musk said he did not expect the company would have to sell more shares to finance the Model 3 launch. However, most analysts expect the company will have to raise capital next year, possibly with a sale of equity.

Musk and other company insiders recused themselves from the shareholder vote on the SolarCity acquisition. But Musk campaigned hard for the deal, arguing SolarCity’s operations would add $1 billion to Tesla’s revenue by 2017, and generate an additional $500 million in cash over three years.

Musk received a boost for the SolarCity deal earlier this month when Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended that investors in both companies approve the deal. Under the proposed transaction, SolarCity shareholders will get 0.110 of a Tesla share for each share in the solar company.

As of Sept. 30, SolarCity had $259.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.68 billion in total liabilities, including debt.

SolarCity has expanded dramatically in the last five years, but it relies heavily on borrowing money to finance its no-money-down residential solar installations. After expanding installations more than 70% between 2014 and 2015, SolarCity ratcheted down its forecast three times this year and now expects just a modest increase compared with 2015."

Fidelity, Tesla’s largest outside investor, increased its stake in the carmaker by 25% to 20.36 million shares as of June 30, according to filings analyzed by Thomson Reuters Eikon.

Tesla shares were added to other portfolios during the second quarter including hedge fund Alyeska Investment Group, which took a new 100,000 share position. Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co of New York boosted its stake in Tesla by 24% to 808,661 shares.

Solar panel installer SolarCity this month accepted a $2.6 billion offer from Tesla, a deal first announced on June 21 and a step in the plan of Elon Musk to create a carbon-free energy and transportation company.

Musk is chief executive of Tesla, chairman of both companies and their biggest shareholder. Shares of SolarCity have declined by more than 50% this year, making some skeptical of the deal that caused Tesla’s stock to drop 10% on the first trading day after the merger was announced.

But Tesla shares have since recovered and were trading around $226 Monday afternoon, as big investors appear to have stood by the company.

SolarCity (scty) shares are also higher before the deal was announced. Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co listed owning 43,840 shares of SolarCity at the end of June, down from 832,139 shares at the end of the first quarter. Fidelity, SolarCity’s second-largest investor, held 11.65 million shares as of June 30, according to Reuters data, 20% less than at the end of March.

The Tesla Motors CEO this week announced plans to purchase solar power-provider Solar City. Critics and a dropping stock price say Tesla's push beyond the auto industry, which it's hardly mastered, is a gamble too far. But Tesla is playing the long game.

“The world does not lack for automotive companies,"" Musk said Tuesday. ""The world lacks for sustainable energy companies.""

In the two and a half months since introducing the Model 3, Tesla Motors has taken more than 400,000 deposits for the long-awaited $30,000 sedan, due to start production late next year. The rest of the industry is also slowly ramping up its electric offerings, which shouldn't cost any more than a gas-powered car by 2022. That has potential environment benefits, but it won't help much if the aging, fossil-fuel reliant American energy grid can't keep up without piling coal into the furnace.

Last year Musk announced Tesla Energy, a scheme to sell huge batteries for home and industrial energy storage. Now Tesla wants to complete the package by enveloping SolarCity, which bills itself as a complete solution for ditching fossil fuels and running your home on sun power. Musk already owns 22 percent of the company and sits on its board.

It's an enticing vision of clean energy vertical integration: If Tesla and Solar City shareholders approve the deal, a customer could someday walk into one of the bright white stores popping up around the country, buy rooftop solar panels to turn sunlight into electricity, a brand new car to use that electricity, and a 6.4-kWh battery to store anything left over.

“They’re building the model of the energy company of the future,” says Matt Roberts, executive director of the Energy Storage Association, an industry trade group. As electric cars spread, the energy ecosystem must adapt to support them.

One of the obstacles to increasing America's use of renewable energy is that the nation's grid doesn't store energy. It produces just enough to meet consumer demand at any given moment, but solar panels and wind turbines can't spin up whenever someone flicks a light switch the way a coal- or gas-fired power can. So engineers are investigating ways to hold onto the energy they produce for use when needed, from rock-filled trains on hills to giant hydroelectric projects, to Tesla's ""Powerwall"" batteries.

There's a clear business case here: Musk says he can expand the market for solar panels by offering them to people who are already considering buying an electric car, and vice versa. He didn’t offer figures on how many Tesla customers were interested in strapping solar panels onto their roofs, but said he’d be shocked if they weren’t. In other words, Tesla wants to offer the whole fossil fuel-free frittata. Forget ""well to wheels."" Tesla's talking generation to acceleration.

A distributed network of batteries in homes could help buffer the energy supply, but so could electric vehicles themselves. In Japan, Nissan is experimenting with using electric Leaf cars to give power back to homes, or to keep lights on in dealerships. Right now in the US there’s not much advantage to volunteering your car or expensive home battery to help out the local grid. But within the next decade, utility companies will start jacking up rates when demand climbs—so the option to power your Xbox from your EV instead of the grid will suddenly be tantalizing. “Things like the Powerwall are an expensive product for a subset of early adopters,” says Roberts, “but they’re laying the foundation for what will come.”

Tesla is far from alone in this view of the future; BMW and Daimler have programs that use old and new electric car batteries as energy storage systems. But Musk has a strong brand and the ability to generate publicity—rather like Apple, which recently created “Apple Energy LLC”. That sub-company plans to sell consumers the excess energy it generates with its solar installations at corporate sites. Combine that with the reports and rumors that Apple's building an electric car, you can imagine another “integrated energy company” motoring into life."

Tesla Motors” Model 3 electric cars. (Tesla Motors via Reuters)

Earlier this year, breathtaking numbers of pre-orders for the Tesla Model 3 not only shocked the auto industry but suggested that a transition of the U.S. and world auto fleet toward electric vehicles could happen faster than expected.

There are still only a little more than 400,000 electric vehicles on the road in the United States, or just 0.16 percent of all cars. But predicted growth rates could have them at more than one-third of new car sales globally by 2040, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And the growth won’t just be in personal vehicles — services such as Uber and Lyft, and makers of self-driving cars such as Google and Tesla, could also drive fast growth of the electric vehicle, or EV, fleet.

As the cars and their batteries get cheaper, meanwhile, they’ll become more and more accessible to buyers — even as a profusion of charging stations to service growing numbers of vehicles will help address the major psychological factor holding people back: “range anxiety.” These trends, combined with climate change concerns, all presage a bright future for the electric car.

All of which means that at some point — and maybe not that far from now, at least in certain neighborhoods or areas — this trend could start to have key implications for the entire electricity system, says a new report released Wednesday from the energy think tank the Rocky Mountain Institute.

An electric vehicle with a 30-kilowatt-hour battery, the report notes, “stores as much electricity as the average U.S. residence consumes in a day.” It adds that if all U.S. light duty cars suddenly became EVs, “they would require about 1,000 [terawatt hours] of additional electricity per year, or an increase of about one-quarter of our current electricity demand.”

Clearly, a lot of EVs means a lot of electricity use. In particular, if large numbers of EVs are charging at roughly the same hour of day — and that time of day is likely to be when people get home from work, which is when electricity use spikes already — the repercussions could be massive. Electricity is most expensive during these peak hours, and power companies have to fire up “peaker plants,” usually driven by natural gas, to slake demand.

“If it increased the peak we would have to invest more money for more generation capacity for the peak, which is the most expensive kind of generation capacity,” says the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Chris Nelder, one of the authors of the report.

This is either a huge coming problem — or a huge opportunity. The Rocky Mountain Institute report sees it as the latter.

The idea is that if we can find ways to shift when this growing fleet of electric vehicles charge up — either toward daylight hours, when they’re more likely to be powered by solar, or to overnight hours, when electricity is cheap — then it opens up a number of options and efficiencies. The result, the report says, could actually be more renewables on the grid, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and cheaper electricity prices.

“Instead of investing in this peak capacity, we want to shift that charging so that it happens in the middle of the night when you’ve got baseload capacity sitting there running,” Nelder says. The result, he says, could “actually optimize the use of all the other assets on the grid. And in so doing, it could actually reduce the per kilowatt-hour cost of electricity.”

That’s one option — which could be accomplished, the report says, by creating financial incentives, in the form of time-varying electricity rates, to push more people to charge overnight, which they’ll be able to do with sophisticated charging controls or apps that give the option of having cars draw power while the owners are asleep.

But another idea is to shift more charging toward the middle of the day — the prime time to take advantage of growing amounts of solar power, especially in key places like California. In this scenario, the growing number of EVs are “basically going to act like a big sponge to soak up all that power,” Nelder says. This would make every mile driven by these EVs greener, and it would also probably flatten the peak of daily energy demand.

The critical factor, though, would be the vast infrastructure of charging stations that will need to accompany EV growth.

“For that load to have a positive, as opposed to negative, effect on the grid, those chargers need to be where vehicles can plug into them at the right time,” the report says.

As the right time is likely to be in the middle of the day, the chargers need to be located at workplaces, malls and other public areas.

It also isn’t clear who will be deploying all these chargers — private charging companies, or large utilities. The latter would presumably have a greater incentive to site them in a way that fits with an overall vision of how the grid will operate.

Nonetheless, strategically timing the charging of EVs opens some interesting possibilities for the grid. For instance, the Rocky Mountain Institute study notes that if “aggregator” companies could simultaneously control the timing of charging for large numbers of EVs (with each owner receiving a small payment for allowing this), they could then effectively switch charging off and on as a form of “demand response” that lessens pressure on the grid at key times, and so further optimizes its performance.

The report does not, however, look very deeply into one other theorized way that fleets of electric vehicles could interact with the grid — by serving as distributed batteries, and temporarily discharging power when needed for various grid services.

“I think in every case, if you plugged in your EV right now, and used it to supply energy back to the grid, it would void the warranty on the vehicle,” Nelder says. He thinks this possibility is just too far off right now, though he acknowledges that that, too, could change.

For now, the primary goal is waking up the electricity sector to a coming EV boom.

“We don’t want utilities and regulators sleeping on this,” Nelder says, “because if they don’t see it coming, and they don’t put appropriate tariffs and regulations into place, if they don’t make sure that they’re helping get charging stations put in place at the right places where people can access them at the right time of day … they’ll lose control of the situation.”"

He'S Won National Awards For His Investigations + Feature Stories. Prior To Joining The Organization + He Was An Investigative Reporter At The Virginian-Pilot + Where He Covered State Government + The Military + Criminal Justice.,"The United Automobile Workers has hit Tesla with a federal labor complaint, claiming the electric vehicle maker consistently harassed and recently fired union supporters despite their strong performance records.

The complaint escalates tensions between factory workers and the automaker, even as Tesla scrambles to boost production and expand its market. The company also faces a new class action lawsuit over the terminations.

The UAW charges in a complaint filed this week the company retaliated against union supporters in its recent round of dismissals to thwart organizing efforts. Tesla fired several hundred employees this month after annual performance reviews.

A company spokesman said it respects workers rights to protest and discuss union organizing.

“No one at Tesla has ever or will ever have any action taken against them based on their feelings on unionization,” the spokesman said.

He added that complaints to the National Labor Relations Board are commonly filed in union disputes.

Tesla workers are not represented by a union. The UAW this year began supporting workers seeking to organize at the Fremont plant, where employees have raised concerns about safety and low wages.

Among those fired this month were engineers, factory workers, and sales and administrative staff. The company said the dismissals, which employees have estimated to be between 400 and 1,000 workers, were based on annual performance reviews. Tesla refused to say how many employees have been fired.

Some of the ongoing dismissals include former SolarCity employees, a company spokesman told this news organization. Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in November.

The worker turmoil comes as Tesla is trying to expand production of its new Model 3 sedan, but only produced 260 cars last quarter. It has a backlog of about 450,000 orders for the lower cost electric vehicle. And major automakers are moving quickly to produce new, long-range electric vehicles to compete with the Palo Alto company’s lineup.

Despite production woes and failure to turn an annual profit, Tesla is seeking to expand.

The company website lists more than 2,500 open positions, including engineers, production workers, sales persons and service technicians around the globe. Tesla is also seeking dozens of roofers and salespersons for its energy and solar products.

Many long-term employees remain angry about being fired, saying the dismissals were not related to performance.

One factory worker, Abraham Duarte, sued Tesla in Alameda Superior Court on Tuesday, claiming he and other workers were laid-off, not fired for poor performance. State law requires large companies to alert workers 60 days before they are laid off, or else face penalties of paying up to two months of back pay to workers.

The suit claims the terminations were the result of Tesla’s “lack of funds or lack of work” and seeks back pay for the ex-employees.

Duarte worked in Fremont for three years and had an excellent work record, said his attorney, Nick Rosenthal. “This came as a complete shock to him,” Rosenthal said.

Union supporters also felt targeted.

Richard Ortiz worked as a production associate in the factory. He supported the union, wearing t-shirts and sharing information about organizing the plant.

In April, Ortiz and two other workers filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming the company’s confidentiality agreement restricted and intimidated workers from exercising their legal right to discuss unionizing.

Last week, Ortiz was fired. His supervisors told him he was let go for violating the confidentiality agreement.

“I’ve worked in auto manufacturing my whole life,” he said in a statement. “I do not believe – not for a second – that I was fired for cause.”

Mike Williams, 35, worked his way up to become a welder on the production line during his five years at Tesla. Some weeks, he clocked 72 hours at the factory to meet the company’s aggressive production goals. He never received any complaints about his performance, he said.

After his shift on Oct. 10, he got a call at home in Pittsburg from his supervisor and a human resources officer. They told him he was a “negative influence” on his coworkers, and fired him.

Williams believes it was because he wore a union shirt and stickers.

Williams and several other workers interviewed have declined to sign a separation agreement, unsure whether to fight the terminations or accept the two weeks salary offered by the company and waive future claims.

“I was totally blindsided,” Williams said. “I over-performed every day. I worked hard for this company.”"

But after a financial analyst published a disaster account last week of how it has taken eight months to repair his Model S, another question has been front-and-center: Can Tesla and its repair network fix these cars in a timely fashion, especially when it’s counting on mass sales of the Model 3?



Evan Niu, a writer at the finance website Motley Fool and a former Tesla employee, detailed his experience in a March 7 post on how his Model S has been in the shop for eight months after being rear-ended. Less than a half-year after purchasing the vehicle, Niu wrote that the vehicle was involved in an accident while his wife was behind the wheel.

A driver failed to hit his brakes and rear-ended the vehicle at a relatively low speed, Niu wrote. A photo included in the post showed a smashed rear-end, but Niu said it “looks worse than it was.” He transported the vehicle to the only Tesla-approved body shop in his immediate area. The body shop, he said, ordered the parts necessary for the repair soon “after receiving my damaged car.”

That’s when the delay began. After three months, Niu said, the body shop still hadn’t received the necessary parts. (Tesla handles routine service, but contracts body work to a network of third-party shops.) Another five months, and Niu still had no car. All for a fender bender.

Niu isn’t alone in having issues with repair delays for Tesla vehicles.

‘It’s Not Like You Can Shop Around For A Second Opinion’

Tesla owners who spoke with Jalopnik described similar experience, with delays for repairs lasting several months—an issue that can be particularly problematic when it comes to loaner vehicles, which insurance companies typically only cover for 30-45 days.

Advertisement

It’s typical for any car to be outsourced to a body shop after a wreck, but only certain shops are approved by Tesla to work on their cars. And unlike nearly all other automakers, Tesla does not have a dealer network to conduct other repairs since it relies on a direct sales model, and instead has regional service centers for that kind of work.

These customers’ complaints deal mostly with body shops, but it goes both ways, since some shops say Tesla takes too long to send parts for repairs.

Jon Levy, a 40-year-old attorney in Miami, said he purchased a Model S 70 about a year ago because he was attracted to the environmental benefits of the sleek electric vehicle.



Levy told Jalopnik the accident happened when his car was left at an airport parking lot; while he was away, somebody had backed into the bumper.

“It was fairly perceptible,” he said. “But as I learned from having the car repaired, there’s a whole more that goes under the bumper than meets the eye.” A security guard witnessed the incident, so Levy was fortunate enough that a police report was filed. “Insurance covered the whole thing except my deductible,” he said.

The body shop estimated a roughly $7,500 bill to fix the damage, with a turnaround of seven-to-eight weeks. The problem, he said, was it’s the only Tesla-approved body shop within 30-60 miles of his home.

“Had I known then what I know now, I would’ve asked them to take the car apart and determine what’s necessary and... put the car back together,” Levy said, as the Model S could at least drive. “Instead, it sat two months in a body shop.”

Levy said he ended up paying out of pocket for a car rental, as well as gas “that I otherwise wouldn’t pay for, and at the same time, paying a premium for the car in a body shop.”

Within the last several weeks, Levy said he vented about the situation on Reddit, which prompted a surprise reply from a forum member who said her husband works at Tesla. The woman asked for his VIN number, Levy said, and asked her husband “if he’d put my order to the top.”

“A week or two later,” Levy said, “the car was done.”

While that’s an optimistic note to end on, Levy said he may have been dissuaded from purchasing a Tesla vehicle in the first place if he had a better understanding of the potential situation he found himself in. (When he purchased his vehicle, Levy said he wasn’t made aware that only one body shop exists in the Miami area.)

“I’m a 100 percent ambassador for Tesla,” he said. “I love the car, I love everything about it ... But I do warn people in advance who ask me, because I’ve referred a few people to get a car and I’ve just told them, that’s my experience.”

“Something as insignificant as a fender bender can cost me several thousand dollar and two months,” he added. “There’s something wrong with that picture.”

Who’s To Blame?

Soon after Niu’s accident, Tesla President Jon McNeill responded in a post on the Tesla Motors Club, pinning blame for the screw-up on the body shop itself.

The body shop in the OP article did not begin repairs on the car for three months and then ordered more than 90 parts and took over seven months to repair the car. Neither of those are indicators of competence. To top it off, they blamed their performance on Tesla. We know from complaints that the body shop experience needs to get a lot better – and fast.

“Most of the customer complaints about body shops mentioned parts, so we focused on this issue,” McNeill said, adding that backlog has been reduced by over 80 percent.



“Even though we reduced part wait times, we continued to dig into the body shop complaints,” he continued. “What we found was astounding—cars sat at body shops for weeks and sometimes months before the body shops took action and, more often than not, the body shops blaming Tesla for parts delays were the very shops that hadn’t even ordered parts or started the repair.”

So, Tesla said it’s applying “brute force” to address the issue immediately. An employee will now manage “each car” on behalf of Tesla owners seeking repairs in a third party body shop. McNeill said that Tesla will add over 300 shops to its third-party network over the next few weeks, while eliminating poor performing shops.”

But will that be enough to withstand the potential onslaught of repairs needed when the Model 3 hits full production? Tesla Founder Elon Musk has said he wants the automaker to produce 500,000 vehicles annually by next year. It’s unclear how many third-party shops are in the Tesla network; a spokesperson couldn’t elaborate.



A study conducted on behalf of a major automaker provided a minor flick of insight into what type of consumer is attracted to the Model 3. The study captures only a snapshot of the background of a small number of reservation holders, but the findings suggest the mass-market sedan won’t be a car for Tesla-fanatics alone. It’ll rope in customers who rely on a vehicle just as Dorr described it.

Obtained by Daily Kanban’s Edward Niedermeyer, the study looked at about 800 Tesla Model 3 reservation holders, electric vehicle owners, and luxury brand car owners. (There’s at least 373,000 refundable reservations for the Model 3.)

Advertisement

According to Niedermeyer, Model 3 reservation holders who participated in the study said they were “more than twice as likely to own a Toyota as any other brand,” and a “significant portion” reported a household annual income of between $25,000 and $49,000 in 2015. (The Model 3 MSRP is expected to be around $35,000 before tax incentives are included.)

“With the majority of its potential Model 3 customers coming out of affordable, reliable cars like the Camry,” he wrote, “they will not tolerate the level of service Tesla is currently providing.”



Advertisement

Tesla told Jalopnik that experiences like Niu’s are “unacceptable,” and asserted that “service capacity isn’t measured by number of service centers.” Current centers under construction have “up to a few dozen service bays,” the company said, while early centers only had a few. A reported mobile repair service will make “our service capacity significantly more scalable,” the company added. In an investor letter released last month, the company said more than 80 percent of repairs are “so minor that they can be done remotely.”

Five-Month Delay

Indeed, most Tesla owners hold the ownership experience in very high regard. The brand came in first in a Consumer Reports satisfaction survey. Still, the repair experiences for some Tesla owners has left a sour taste about the company.

“I’m actually not a Model 3 reservation holder probably for that reason right now,” said Tim Dorr, a Model S85 owner in Atlanta. “I was considering it for awhile, but just the long term viability of the car depends on its ability to be repaired if necessary.”

Dorr, 34, said his Model S was taken to a body shop after sustaining “pretty extensive front-end damage” in an accident. There’s only two approved body shops in the Atlanta-area, Dorr said, and the one he took it to had an estimate of over $28,000 in damage.

Advertisement

“They had the car for the past five months,” he said. The body shop said the delay’s primarily Tesla’s fault for fulfilling a parts order—something that’s an obvious sticking point between the automaker and its third-party network of body shops.

For Dorr, despite the long wait, he had a decent experience with Tesla’s local service center; the estimated turnaround for the servicing was a week, and it was accomplished in “about four days,” he said.

Advertisement

The experience has “definitely made me more of a cautious driver,” he said, “not that i was super reckless or anything—it’s probably more in terms of the driving experience. In, terms of my perception of the company itself, it’s still really good.”

But he hopes the delays are reduced as the company moves toward the Model 3 production date.

“As cars get more complex, that’s always a more complex problem for any manufacturer,” he said. “But I think the key thing here is beyond just training and certification, and getting people knowing how to do it. Giving them the ability to actually do it is crucial. If they don’t have parts available, they can’t apply those skills no matter how refined or good they are.”"

The car is also getting a couple new interior finish choices and the a version of the Model X's ultra-aggressive cabin air filtration system as an option, which promises to filter out ""99.97% of particulate exhaust pollution and effectively all allergens, bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air."" It also includes the positive-pressure ""Bioweapon Defense Mode"" from the Model X.

Additionally, the Model S now has a 48-amp charger standard — up from 40 amps — which Tesla says will enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets.

The changes are effective immediately and are already live on Tesla's website.

As evidenced by both the Model X and the Model 3, Tesla's design language is definitely trending toward a grille-less front end, possibly in an effort to squeeze as much aerodynamic efficiency out of the car as possible. (Elon Musk has said that he hopes for an impressively low 0.21 coefficient of drag for the Model 3.) It's a look that takes a little bit of getting used to — but judging from Model 3 pre-orders, it's certainly not deterring very many people.

Notably missing from this week's Model S update is the rumored 100kWh battery, which would improve the vehicle's range. Musk noted on a call last year that he expects battery packs to continue improving in capacity over a model's life, and it's possible — if not very likely — that the 100kWh model will be coming soon. At present, the Model S's largest battery is 90kWh.

“It’s huge, isn’t it?” she says, pressing the double-size, iPad-like control screen in the center console until the stereo blasts Adele’s “Send My Love.” Then comes the ceremonial closing of the gull-wing doors on Zhu’s Model X. We peer through an expansive glass roof. Zhu, the assistant to the chairman of a major marketing agency, likes SUVs for their safety on China’s chaotic roads—she and her husband upgraded from a BMW X5. One of the first Model X owners in China, Zhu paid a deposit before Tesla had even calculated how much a deposit should be.

“Now put your head back against the seat,” she advises.

The two-lane road we’re on is missing traffic lines, not to mention levelness, but as a section clears ahead, Vanessa floors it. We whir past a small black Hyundai so fast that the car seems to turn stationary. For a second, driver and passenger feel the same head rush. Then Vanessa slams on the brakes to respect a stop sign, chuckles, and changes Adele songs.

The sight of Teslas whizzing down roads in China’s biggest cities is becoming as common as—well, the sight of Teslas whizzing down roads in Silicon Valley.

In 2016, Tesla tripled its sales in China over the previous year’s, to 10,400 vehicles, according to research firm JL Warren Capital, or about 13% of the nearly 80,000 cars it delivered worldwide. The company reported in March that it earned $1.1 billion in revenue in China last year—a boost that helped Tesla join the ranks of the Fortune 500 for the first time, with just over $7 billion in revenue worldwide. And Tesla’s China news has only gotten better since then: Its imports in the first three months of 2017 have put it on pace to easily double sales this year. Wealthy drivers are crowding showrooms in China’s major cities, and Chinese buyers have put down $1,200 to preorder the company’s Model 3 sedan in numbers second only to those in the U.S.

The sales rush is the clearest sign yet that Tesla has turned a corner in the world’s largest auto market. And it has caught almost everyone by surprise. As recently as last summer, the narrative had been that Tesla just didn’t get China. The automaker was on track for its third consecutive year of weak sales. The few consumers who knew about Teslas didn’t know how to recharge one; those who preordered had faced delivery delays and iffy service. What’s more, Tesla lacked the joint-venture partners that helped other foreign carmakers break into China’s market. Michael Dunne, who runs independent advisory Dunne Automotive in Hong Kong, wrote a column in September predicting Elon Musk would reach Mars before cracking China.

Today, Dunne is cheerfully sheepish about that column, and other naysayers are equally befuddled. There’s no single explanation for Tesla’s breakthrough. Sales got a lift from the introduction of the Model X, a luxury SUV for an SUV-mad country. The company also benefited from a critical mass of charging stations; from its direct-sales model, in a country where buyers feel fleeced by dealerships; and from CEO Elon Musk’s celebrity among the technorati.

But chummy government relations also matter in a country where the state exerts enormous economic control, and Tesla’s technology just happens to align perfectly with government priorities. Cofounder Martin Eberhard has said Tesla was started to fight climate change. Nowhere is the climate fight more important than in China, the world’s largest spewer of greenhouse gases, which is in the midst of an unprecedented promotion of electric cars: Last year, sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in China rose 50% to 507,000, more than three times the U.S. figure.

The government estimates that as many as 7 million electric cars could be sold in China annually by 2025. It sees them as a way not only to clear smoggy skies, but to hack into the top rankings of the global auto industry. In electric, Chinese companies don’t have to match the quality of a Ford or Mercedes-Benz; they think they can quickly build a whole new car. “For electric vehicles in China, we have a new technology model every two years,” says Dong Yang, a high-ranking Communist Party official at the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers, the auto lobby.

Still, virtually all Chinese electric cars are low-cost, relatively low-performance ones, without the luxury trimmings and lightning-fast acceleration that Tesla owners fetishize. Government officials consider Tesla a role model for these Chinese brands, and they’ve cheered the company from the sidelines. Today, a handful of Chinese companies and cities are feverishly courting Tesla for a joint venture, Fortune has learned, and Musk has said his company could begin building cars in China before the end of 2018.

A joint venture could turn Tesla’s China growth stratospheric, because its current model of importing cars from California is costly. Chinese tariffs and taxes boost the price of Tesla’s sedans and SUVs in the country by 50% compared with the U.S.; the Model S sedan starts at the equivalent of $105,000, and the Model X at $130,000. So even as Tesla woos middle-class buyers in the U.S. (the Model 3, due to arrive this fall, will start at about $35,000) buyers in China have mostly resembled Vanessa Zhu: wealthy drivers who view Teslas as luxury vehicles, or at least as the coolest new piece of tech since the iPhone. Most of Tesla’s 2016 sales were concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, China’s centers of capital and affluence.

Even if Tesla doesn’t become a mass-market brand, sales in China alone could soon climb to 100,000 a year, impacting Tesla as intensely as a new, 1.4-billion-person market would Coca-Cola. “I could see a future where Tesla is displacing a lot of those Audis and Mercedes-Benz that are everywhere on Chinese roads,” says Dunne.

Not bad for a company that, until recently, was digging out from under past mistakes.

Tesla began taking preorders in China for the Model S in August 2013. The company didn’t know exactly how much each car would cost, and deliveries were eight months away. But anticipation ran high. The combination of Musk’s renown, stories comparing Tesla’s acceleration to a Ferrari’s, and intrigue over the new technology sent preorders above 5,000 by the end of the year.

The hype was there, but the sales and support were not. The original head of Tesla’s China business was Kingston Chang, formerly of luxury automaker Bentley. Chang wanted to broadly expand Tesla’s operations, including customer service centers, public relations, and car-charging networks, according to tech news site PingWest. But Tesla headquarters told him to build a sales team first, betting that good marketing could bring in more revenue before more stores and charging stations were finished being built. Tesla opened just a single showroom in Beijing, opposite an American Apparel store in one of the city’s glitziest malls.

Tesla’s strategy shifted again after Veronica Wu came aboard in December 2013, after a successful stint in big enterprise and education sales for Apple in China. At Tesla, she discussed adding traditional outlets like dealerships to the mix, similar to the way Apple had added retail channels in China. Though headquarters balked, Tesla in China was soon encouraging fleet sales orders of 100 or more cars from car-rental agencies and institutions, to jump-start demand. Staff, especially salespeople, soared from 10 employees to more than 100, and later to 600.

At the same time, Tesla imposed rules that frustrated individual buyers. Before customers could order a car, Tesla required that they prove they had a parking spot and a home charger, to ensure a good experience. The company also required that buyers live in a city that had a Tesla service center—even though, as of mid-2014, only Beijing and Shanghai had such centers. Some high-rise apartment managers, meanwhile, balked at having chargers installed in their buildings.

The mismatch between Tesla’s approach and customer demand created a big opportunity for gray-market resellers—who bought in bulk and catered to buyers who didn’t meet Tesla’s criteria. The company had no official resellers, but the cars made their way to many, who sold in dealerships, car centers, and even on Alibaba’s TMall for more than the same models cost on Tesla’s website. “There were a lot more scalpers than we expected,” Wu now says. Others questioned whether the company was really in the dark: “Most ‘fleet’ sales were just a flimsy cover for sales to resellers,” concluded Bertel Schmitt of Dailykanban.com, an auto industry site. It was all legal, but also a sign that Tesla had strayed from the high-touch sales approach it used elsewhere.

Tesla’s first China deliveries arrived in spring 2014; Wu later told Reuters that China sales could drive 35% of the company’s growth. But that was already sounding fanciful. Tesla was hurriedly building customer-service centers, and customers outside of Beijing and Shanghai were told they wouldn’t get their cars until those centers were finished. One buyer made national news when he smashed the windshield of his own Tesla, after it arrived months later than expected. Meanwhile, the Chinese press didn’t shower Tesla with as much coverage as the West’s did. As a result, most potential customers didn’t know much about Tesla’s product. Consumers didn’t know they could charge their car at home every night like a cell phone; most thought they had to rely on the still-small Supercharger network.

By the end of 2014, Tesla’s business was a mess. About 4,700 cars had been shipped to China, but only 2,500 were sold and registered to drivers. (The company delivered 18,500 cars in the U.S. that year.) Publicly, Tesla blamed the gap on speculators who entered orders, then didn’t buy the Teslas once they shipped. But several former employees say the real problem was the lack of customer support. Says Ricardo Reyes, Tesla’s former communications chief: “I think Tesla took for granted that they were just going to succeed in China.”

By December 2014, both Chang and Wu had left Tesla. Tesla executives in California griped privately that China wasn’t so unique that it demanded a different strategy. But not long afterward, the company began an apology tour that marked a turning point. On a frigid evening in January 2015, during the Detroit International Auto Show, Musk admitted China sales were “unexpectedly weak.” That spring, he traveled to China to meet with President Xi Jinping and other leaders, tweeting that he remained “very optimistic” despite “earlier mistakes.” Reyes offered a mea culpa at the Shanghai auto show in spring 2015, the first Chinese motor show that Tesla bothered attending: “I think we have been a little bit too impatient in the Chinese market.” It was as contrite as the company would get—and the news it was generating was about to get better.

In 2015, Tom Zhu, a respected engineer responsible for China’s Supercharger network, became the top executive in the country. The company ended that year with a disappointing 3,700 cars sold, but there were slivers of optimism. For one thing, Tesla was building Supercharger locations in China at a faster pace than anywhere in the world, addressing consumers’ “charge anxiety.” About 120 Supercharger locations exist in China today, compared with 370 in the U.S., and Tesla says China will have more than 800 charging stations by the end of 2017.

Just as important: Word was getting out that buying a Tesla was easier than buying other luxury cars. In China, dealerships known as “4S stores” (for “service, spare parts, sale, and survey”) largely corner the market for popular luxury brands like BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz. The stores inflate costs for consumers by tens of thousands of dollars with various vague fees. Tesla’s direct-sales showrooms eschew that system. And while import tariffs increase their overall cost, Tesla otherwise prices its cars in China at the same level that it does in the U.S. after currency adjustments.

Vanessa Zhu visited three other brands before she settled on her Model X. The Range Rover dealership asked for an additional 300,000 yuan ($45,000) as its standard fee, she says; Porsche told her she had to wait three months for its Cayenne SUV and required a 100,000-yuan delivery fee. Tesla in contrast, put her on a one-size-fits-all waiting list and didn’t impose fees. “In China, a car is a symbol of your status, so most people don’t care what you pay in terms of those extra fees,” Zhu says. “But I do care. I don’t like it.”

Tesla owners also found out they could beat China’s bureaucracy in the license-plate game. China’s local governments restrict the number of drivers on their clogged, polluted streets by controlling the number of plates issued. Drivers have to wait years to get one through a lottery system. (In early 2015, 6.2 million people applied for just 36,757 available Beijing plates.) And once drivers get a plate, they are barred from driving one day a week.

But plates for electric cars now fall under different rules, thanks to the government’s push for electric vehicles. Beginning in 2014, Shanghai allowed electric-car drivers to get a license plate without facing a wait, a $12,000 plate fee, or driving restrictions. Other cities followed suit, and such policies became a boon for China’s electric-car makers. Without them, “there’s no possibility that private consumers would buy these vehicles,” says Zhang Yong, deputy general manager at the electric-car offshoot of state-owned Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.

The policies were game changers for Tesla too. The first six cities in China to have exempted electric vehicles from license plate restrictions: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. The cities with the highest Tesla sales, according to Junheng Li of JL Warren Capital: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin.

While the policies helped sell Model S sedans, Tesla realized quickly that the Model X would be a much bigger story in China. China’s obsession with SUVs is 10 years old and going strong. Their popularity stems from a variety of factors: Domestic ­makers produce good models; their seating can accommodate an entire extended family; they’re widely believed to be safer; and their higher prices imbue status. German luxury-car maker Porsche’s bestselling vehicle in China isn’t a sports car but its Macan SUV.

By 2015, SUV sales were the only growing part of the Chinese auto market; in the first half of 2016, SUVs accounted for 35% of passenger-vehicle sales. It’s no coincidence, then, that a spike in Tesla sales coincides exactly with the first Model X deliveries in China, in June 2016. In the second half of last year, with the SUV available, Tesla notched 7,670 sales—about three-quarters of its total for the year in China. Tesla’s sales had finally caught up to its hype.

Close government relations are a must in China for foreign companies, and Tesla has carefully cultivated them. Like Apple, Tesla has created new businesses thanks to its demand for Chinese-made components, particularly its cars’ giant touch screens. In 2015, Tom Zhu said Tesla would double its spending on Chinese-made parts, committing to buying $500 million worth of supplies from Chinese companies that year; such spending has likely only skyrocketed.

The far bigger question mark is whether, and when, Tesla will announce plans for a factory in the country. Every car brand with significant China sales—including luxury-auto makers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW—runs a joint venture with a local partner. The government has required as much for decades. Imported cars face hefty fees, as Tesla owners are painfully aware. A Model 3 sedan’s $35,000 starting price in the U.S. becomes $50,000 in China after a 25% tariff and 17% value-added tax—a heavy lift for a middle-class buyer. “If they don’t announce plans for local production, they will struggle to sustain this performance,” says Bill Russo, former head of Chrysler North East Asia and managing director of Gao Feng Advisory in Shanghai.

Tesla remains cagey about what those plans could look like. Dong Yang, the auto lobby official, says several potential local partners are courting the company, and that multiple provinces and municipalities want Tesla to build a plant with them: “They all offer better and better options,” Dong says. In May, Musk said Tesla would more clearly define its plans for China production by the end of this year; a spokesman declined to give further details.

Tesla Joins a Very Exclusive Club

When Fortune introduced its list of the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue, in 1955, it included five U.S. automakers. By 1999, only Ford and General Motors remained. Tesla is the first new car manufacturer ever to join the list. Here, a look at Fortune 500 carmakers from years past.

Tesla may be hesitating because of today’s sales numbers. If you build fewer than 100,000 vehicles a year, it doesn’t make sense to manufacture in China, says Steve Man, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., can churn out more than 500,000 vehicles annually. Even if it doubles China sales this year, Tesla will just pass 20,000 cars. It faces a catch-22: It won’t sell cars at lower prices that drive sales if it doesn’t produce them locally, but local production won’t be economical until sales rise drastically.

Intellectual property is a looming headache as well. Critics of Chinese business practices argue that Tesla faces certain IP theft as soon as it brings manufacturing into China. “Yes, some of its tech will be stolen,” says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at University of California at Berkeley who studies China’s auto market. But Chang adds that the danger inherent in that theft is overstated. “Just stealing tech does not make [a rival] a competitor,” she says. “It’s all about brand.”

Today more than a dozen Chinese-backed manufacturers (many of them American startups that now have Chinese owners) are tripping over one another to promote their electric cars and acceleration times; Faraday Future, Karma Automotive, NextEV, and Future Mobility are but a few. But most are likely to be stuck in the concept or prototype phase for the next several years—even as Teslas zip across China.

That’s one reason Tesla may be able to reach an agreement to produce cars in the country on favorable terms. China lusts after Tesla’s technology but also its management practices. And Tesla already offers its patents to anyone who asks—making it highly plausible that Musk would agree to more information-sharing in return for a vastly expanded market for Tesla’s cars.

One big Chinese corporate player seems to have no doubt about Tesla’s prospects. In late March, Tencent, the politically connected technology giant that recently became one of the world’s 10 largest publicly traded companies, said it spent $1.8 billion buying Tesla stock. Not long afterward, Tesla’s market capitalization edged past that of General Motors, making it the most valuable American automaker.

On a recent Sunday night, three dozen prospective buyers gather in a Tesla showroom in Beijing for a wine tasting. The crowd of mostly thirtysomethings skews wealthy, and cares some about the environment, but they’re mostly in awe of the brand. Tesla’s buyers’ circle has expanded to include the rich along with the very rich. Jeff Yu, whose family runs a yogurt business, thought about buying an SUV from Mercedes-Benz or Maserati, but was put off by their glitz. “Tesla is a tech thing. That’s my taste,” he says.

Evan Qu, a slim man sporting a designer shirt and Buddhist wrist beads, sells audio equipment; he thinks executives at his biggest customer, CCTV, the central broadcaster, will appreciate the environmentalist aura of the Tesla when he rolls up to their next meeting. “This car helps you get more deals,” he says. On Tesla’s website, he’s customized his Model X—color: ocean blue—for a total cost of 1.2 million yuan ($175,000).

A waiter refills Qu’s glass as a promotional video on a loop in the background underscores his aspirations. Choose a Tesla green vehicle, it says, over and over, to advance a better life in the future.

Founder and CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk speaks during a media tour of the Tesla Gigafactory, which will produce batteries for the electric carmaker, in Sparks, Nevada, U.S. July 26, 2016. REUTERS/James Glover II

Unlisted Grohmann Engineering, based in Pruem, Germany, helped Tesla rivals Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) build production facilities for electric car batteries.

Tesla is seeking to raise its global manufacturing capacity to 500,000 vehicles in 2018 from an expected production rate of about 80,000 this year. Its main production facility is in Fremont, California.

""To date, we have increased the production rate at our Fremont Factory by 400 percent in four years, and we expect this acquisition to accelerate that growth rate,"" Tesla said in a blogpost. (bit.ly/2eIkeNm)

Following the acquisition, which still needs to be approved by the cartel authorities in Germany, several elements of Tesla’s automated manufacturing systems will be designed and produced in Pruem, close to Germany’s border with the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

The deal, whose financial terms were not disclosed, is expected to add over 1,000 engineering and skilled technician jobs in Germany over the next two years Tesla said in its blog. Grohmann currently has around 700 employees.

Tesla agreed on Sunday to buy a 74.9 percent stake from company founder and majority owner Klaus Grohmann, and a further 25.1 percent stake belonging to private equity firm Deutsche Beteiligungs AG (DBAG), DBAG said in a statement on Tuesday.

DBAG said it expected to earn in the mid single-digit million euro range by selling its stake in Grohmann and that Grohmann had revenues of 123 million euros ($136 million) in 2015.

DBAG said Grohmann had developed production lines for battery cells and batteries for “numerous” German and international automobile manufacturers. Grohmann was also specialized in the industrial production of fuel cells, DBAG said, and was active in the electronic and semiconductor industries as well as the biotechnology and medical technology sectors.

Grohmann Engineering will be renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation after the deal and will serve as the initial base for Tesla Advanced Automation Germany with other locations to follow, Tesla said.

The deal is expected to close next year.

The car, which starts at $69,500 and is currently the cheapest Model S available, will be on the company’s website through the weekend. It will also sell out the rest of the inventory around the country, and then it will be gone.

At that point, the dual-motor Model S 75D will become the cheapest Model S at $74,500. That also means every Model S and Model X will come with dual motors — one on each axle — and the only rear-wheel drive car Tesla will sell will be the entry-level versions of the Model 3.

Tesla often toys with the pricing of its cars, and has culled the cheapest tier of the Model S more than once before. But this time around, the move feels more philosophical. Tesla’s currently in the early stages of ramping up the production of the Model 3, and despite the heavily advertised $35,000 price tag, that car can easily wind up costing closer to around $40,000 or $50,000, depending on options. (Customers with preorders can’t even take delivery of the $35,000 base version yet.)

Sure, there are probably production line benefits to cutting the Model S 75. But considering how worried CEO Elon Musk has sounded recently about market confusion between the Model 3 and Model S, it’s no shock that there’s now a more noticeable distinction between Model 3 and the cheapest version of the company’s flagship sedan."

Follow Him On Twitter For Updates.,"Electric-car maker Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) stores already break the mold. Located in areas with heavy foot traffic like shopping malls, commission-free employees facilitate an educational environment where visitors can learn about the company's products -- a starkly contrasting experience from pushy auto dealerships. Indeed, when it comes to being salesy, Tesla was ranked dead last by an annual mystery-shopping study by Pied Piper Prospect Satisfaction Index.

But Tesla stores are departing even further from auto dealership practices. During November, the company began selling energy products alongside its vehicles.

Powerwall hits Tesla stores

In dozens of locations across North America, Europe, and Australia, Tesla has revamped its stores to promote and sell its recently updated energy storage product for residential customers, Powerwall 2.

According to Tesla, customers at select locations can now see and learn about Powerwall 2.

The initial stores selected to feature Powerwall 2 were chosen because they were the company's strongest markets for energy products, according to the company. But Tesla will be revamping more locations with its Powerwall in the near future.

Tesla's new Powerwall, which launched in October, includes 14 kilowatt-hours of energy capacity -- twice the capacity of its predecessor. It also costs slightly less per kilowatt hour and, unlike Powerwall 1, includes a built-in inverter. It requires no maintenance and lets customers monitor and control their energy with a Tesla app, the company says.

Capitalizing on a nascent segment

Tesla's rollout of energy products at its stores comes just after the company closed its acquisition of solar panel company SolarCity and essentially previews the combined company's plans for a larger integration of energy products in Tesla stores. Tesla has said it expects the global reach of its 190-plus high-foot traffic stores to increase leads for its solar products after the company begins selling them in its stores. Given that Tesla's energy storage products go hand in hand with solar power generation, the Powerwall's launch in Tesla stores is just a start for a broader rollout of energy products.

Importantly, just because the Tesla Powerwall is only now making it to company stores, investors shouldn't mistake the company's energy business as a new venture. The Powerwall's presence at Tesla stores also comes as the company is ramping up its energy storage business. Tesla first launched its energy storage products in the first half of 2015, and its offerings, which include storage options for residential, commercial, and utility customers, have arguably since surpassed competition in both breadth and scope. The Powerwall's newfound spotlight in Tesla stores pegs the company's ambition to be a leader in a nascent and fast-growing market for energy storage and solar solutions.

A total of 300 megawatt-hours of Tesla energy storage capacity has now been deployed worldwide, Tesla said in October. It also anticipates that energy storage sales could eventually soar to represent one-third of the company's expected 35 gigawatt-hour annual battery production capacity at its under-construction Gigafactory."

With Tesla expected to complete its $2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity this week, the company has given a brief example of what to expect with a major solar energy project that wires up the whole island of Ta’u in American Samoa.

Tesla’s Musk adds solar roofs to his clean energy vision

The island, located more than 4,000 miles from the West Coast of the United States, is no stranger to power rationing and outages and was previously run on diesel generators. Ta’u has had a makeover with Tesla installing a microgrid of solar energy panels and batteries supplying nearly the island’s entire 600 residents power requirement.

It seems the project is intended to show off the potential benefits of the SolarCity acquisition, with Ta’u’s microgrid comprised of 5,328 solar panels from SolarCity and Tesla, along with 60 Tesla Powerpack batteries for storage.

But buying SolarCity remains a risky move for Tesla, with the purchase including billions of dollars of debt for a company that’s far from profitable (SolarCity spends $6 for every $1 it makes in sales).

Nevertheless, Tesla CEO Elon Musk describes the acquisition as “blindingly obvious” — a necessary step in his so-called “Master Plan” to integrate clean energy generation and storage.

SpaceX aiming to return to flight next month: CEO Musk

The company further said that it would offset the island’s use of more than 109,500 gallons of diesel per year, along with the expense of shipping that fuel.

“Factoring in the escalating cost of fuel, along with transporting such mass quantities to the small island, the financial impact is substantial,” said Tesla in a blog post.

As a result of the microgrid, the island can stay fully powered for three days without sunlight, with the capacity to fully recharge within seven hours.

“This project will help lessen the carbon footprint of the world,” local resident Keith Ahsoon said in a Tesla blog post. “Living on an island, you experience global warming firsthand. Beach erosions and other noticeable changes are a part of life here. It’s a serious problem, and this project will hopefully set a good example for everyone else to follow.”

But in addition to Tesla's allure, there are a few key areas that give the electric automaker a serious advantage over its competition.

Let's look at three charts that show why Tesla is the premier electric-car maker of today, and likely into the future.

Electric vehicles are poised for massive growth

Between 2015 and 2024, sales of electric vehicles will jump from just 2.4 million to 6 million. But that's only just the beginning. By 2040, EV sales will account for 35% of all light-vehicle sales that year, and up from just 1% right now.

Here's what that growth will look like over the next 24 years, according to Bloomberg:

Yes, a 24-year outlook is a tad long, I get it. But look at the green bars toward the left side of that chart; that's where EV sales are right now (you can hardly see them!). So, why are barely recognizable worldwide EV sales advantageous for Tesla? Because at the end of the chart, you can clearly see how electric vehicles are expected to become a major part of worldwide sales. It's evidence that Tesla is betting on a winning future, and it already has a sizable lead.

Tesla is currently on its third production electric vehicle (the Model X) and will start production of its fourth (the Model 3) next year. While many other automakers are still trying to decide whether or not electric cars are more than a niche market, Tesla seemed to take a peek at the future, and then created four cars based on what it saw.

Tesla dominates EV sales

Tesla is dominating EV sales in the U.S., and the company's closest competitors -- Nissan's Leaf, BMW Group's i3, and Fiat Chrysler's 500e -- don't even come close.

Here's what U.S. EV sales looked like for all of 2015:

Now, we all know that past performance isn't always a predictor of future success, of course. But consider that this year, Tesla will not only be selling its Model S, but also its Model X SUV. If the company already dominates sales of EVs with just one car, then it's not hard to image two very popular all-electric vehicles will likely add to its already-strong sales (compared to those of other EVs).

Then, add to that that late next year, the Model 3 will officially start production. That means Tesla will have three EV models for sale by late next year. Meanwhile, one of Tesla's closest competitors, BMW, is facing a mass exodus of its core talent to a Chinese electric-car start-up funded by Tencent Holdings.

With competitors struggling to stay in the electric-vehicle game, and Tesla expanding its product line, it's clear the company is poised to continue its lead.

Tesla's Gigafactory will make the company even more competitive

Many Tesla investors have likely seen the graph below, but that doesn't make it any less important to dive into. Tesla's in the middle of building its massive $5 billion Gigafactory out in the Nevada desert and expects it to be at full battery-producing capacity by 2020.

Here's what the Gigafactory's battery prodcution will look like over the next few years, according to Tesla:

Less than four years from now, Tesla will be making more cell batteries than all of the batteries current producers manufactured in 2013. The advantage here lies in Tesla being able to produce massive amounts of batteries for of its vehicles, and thus bring its operating costs down.

The company says it'll be making 500,000 vehicles by that point, and it'll need a lot of batteries to put in them. Keep in mind that Tesla manufactured just over 50,000 vehicles in 2015.

The company says ramping up battery production will not only allow it to produce more cars, but will make its Model 3 a possibility. The massive Gigafactory battery production will help bring the cost per kilowatt hour down by 30% by the time the Model 3 starts production late next year.

No other carmaker has built, or is building, a battery factory of the Gigafactory's scale. The cost reduction for the batteries (one of the most expensive parts of an EV) is allowing Tesla's Model 3 to become a reality -- and to drive further, with more power, and at a cheaper price tag than its competitors.

Foolish thoughts

Tesla will likely hit a few snags along the way -- it's already running into a few problems with early versions of the Model X -- but the above advantages aren't going away any time soon. The company is already outpacing its electric-car competitors right now, and it appears its lead could continue to widen as time goes on."

Et July,"Michigan will lose out of new Tesla jobs because the state banned the company from selling its electric cars through company stores without a dealership network, Clark says. (Photo: AP)

When it comes to manufacturing jobs, Michigan might be its own worst enemy.

Tesla Motors plans to build a new factory for its Model Y crossover SUV, which could translate into thousands of manufacturing jobs. The company is likely to consider Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas as the site of the plant.

As you can tell, Michigan is not on the list. In 2014, Gov. Rick Snyder signed the controversial House Bill 5606, which prevents Tesla from selling its electric cars through company stores without a dealership network. More recently, the Michigan Secretary of State’s office denied Tesla’s request for a dealership license, leading the company to sue the state and request documents related to the passage of H.B. 5606 — now known as the “Anti-Tesla” bill.

It’s safe to say that Michigan isn’t the friendliest business environment. Both Forbes and U.S. News and World Report rank Michigan among the bottom half of states in terms of its business environment. A separate CNBC report ranks Michigan 30th for its “business friendliness”—behind high-tax strongholds such as Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Closing the door to business carries tangible consequences. Tesla’s California plant, for example, already employs more than 10,000 workers and the company is expected to hire 4,400 new employees in the state through 2019. Why would Michigan take itself out of the running for thousands of jobs?

Adding new companies like Tesla is exactly the jolt the Michigan economy could use. According to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), $1.81 is added to the economy for every $1 spent in manufacturing. NAM also estimates manufacturing’s total multiplier effect to be $3.60 for every $1 of value-added output, with one manufacturing employee generating another 3.4 workers on average somewhere else.

But these jobs will never come to Michigan. The state government has instead chosen to vilify the company on behalf of the traditional automobile lobby. When it comes to job creation, states like Michigan need to look to their future instead of protecting their past.

Fortunately for the broader U.S. economy, other states are doing better at keeping cronyism at bay. Low-tax, low-regulation business environments that incentivize businesses to invest are integral to job creation and economic growth.

This basic principle must be applied in Michigan and nationally. President Trump’s proposal to slash the corporate tax rate, for example, would make the United States more competitive and a likelier destination for business investment. The federal corporate tax rate is 35 percent, the highest in the developed world. Taking double taxation into account, American corporate income is actually taxed at more than 55 percent, placing U.S. companies at a severe competitive disadvantage. Ireland, on the other hand, boasts a 12.5 percent rate, making it a more attractive place for American companies looking to expand their business and create more jobs. According to the Tax Foundation, a 15 percent corporate tax rate would boost U.S. economic output by nearly four percent and could lead to 613,000 new jobs.

Congress must follow the president’s lead and make tax reform a reality. The White House has already pursued free-market reforms through executive fiat — the Paris climate rejection comes to mind — but the onus is now on legislators to act on their mandate.

Those in Michigan should do the same and prioritize pro-business — that is, pro-jobs — policies in our state. If the Tesla debacle is any indication, working Americans lose out when state politics replace common sense.

The 10,900-square-foot store replaces Tesla’s prior location in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood. The new store showcases its electric vehicles, including the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The company’s new Model 3, an electric vehicle built for the masses, is not on display at the location.

It also offers what the company describes as an “immersive educational experience” into the company’s vehicles and energy products, which include its Powerwall home battery packs and solar.

Tesla operates seven locations in New York, including one in the NYC borough of Brooklyn, Huntington Station, Manhasset, East Hampton, White Plains, and Mt. Kisco.

Tesla has a different business model than other automakers. The company sells its own cars directly online and through its own branded stores, not through franchised dealerships. In some states, where direct sales are banned, Tesla operates showrooms but

New York allows Tesla to sell directly to consumers. However, the state has placed a cap on the number of stores Tesla can operate."

Revelations about the first fatal crash of a vehicle operating in semi-autonomous driving mode have turned up pressure on auto industry executives and regulators to ensure that automated driving technology is deployed safely.

“We heard about it in the press at first. Of course we look into it because it is important,” Hans Lammers, RDW’s manager for vehicle admission and supervision, told Reuters on Thursday.

“It is an informal exchange,” Lammers said, adding that RDW will await the conclusions of the NHTSA before taking any further steps. RDW was the authority which issued the roadworthiness certificate for Tesla’s Model S in Europe.

The European model deploys a different version of the autopilot function than the one installed on the vehicle involved in the fatal accident, Lammers said.

For the European model, RDW has no safety concerns if drivers use the autopilot function as an assistance tool rather than surrendering complete control of the vehicle to the sophisticated cruise control system.

“We think there is nothing wrong with the system if correctly used,” Lammers said. Tesla has referred to its autopilot function being in its “Beta” version, and Lammers added this label was of no concern.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

“From a functional point of view it is no different from systems approved for other manufacturers,” Lammers said, adding that the Tesla owners manual clearly said it is a driver assistance system.

“At this point there are no next steps. The system was approved. If NHTSA comes up with a reason why it is not in line with type approval requirements we would start looking into that.”

RDW is also in touch with Tesla, Lammers said."
https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-owners-love-cars-2016-12,pos,1.0,8.728039705926653e-19,Here's why Tesla owners love their cars so much,2016-12-29 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:43:19.391904,Matthew Debord,"Want. Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Consumer Reports recently brought out its yearly Owner Satisfaction Survey, and Tesla finished number one, with a whopping 91% of owners saying they'd buy a Tesla vehicle if they had it to do all over again.

That's an astounding figure in a highly competitive industry. It's like a Major League Baseball player batting .900.

In practice, it means that Tesla owners are impossible to ""conquest,"" or woo to other brands, a situation that all the automakers aiming to take on Tesla in the future should take into account as they spend billions developing electric vehicles.

So why do Tesla owners lover their vehicles so much?

Teslas take their cues from consumer technology, not from auto-industry traditions

Cars have been rolling computers for some time now, but the way in which those computers were updated — if they ever were — was extremely old-school. Owners brought the car back to the dealership, and the maintenance guys updated the software or hardware.

This could take all day. Or several days. Or be impossible if the hardware or software could no longer be updated.

Contrast this with Tesla. The carmaker routinely updates software over-the-air. This happens overnight and owners don't need to do anything. The practice has enabled Tesla to abandon model years — there's no such thing as a 2014 Model S or a 2016 Model X — because OTA updates mean you can get a technologically new car in just 24 hours.

True, the hardware isn't new, and for that to be refreshed you have to visit a Tesla service center. But the car's ""brain"" has been made better.

Tesla is following the consumer-electronics industry here. Your iPhone and apps are frequently improved and updated on the software side.

Teslas actually do have the potential to save the planet

There's no debate: powering a car with electrons is superior to powering it with gasoline. The problem for electric cars has always been that gas is a much more efficient fuel source: massive energy content, relatively cheap, easy to store and move around. The average internal-combustion engine is also good for 300-400 miles per tank, while 200-plus-mile-range EVs are just starting to arrive at prices that the mass market can handle.

One caveat here: the electricity that powers Teslas comes mostly from burning coal and natural gas. But it doesn't have to. It could come from sustainable sources or from nuclear power. And in that case Tesla's would still generate zero tailpipe emissions.

As energy sources become cleaner in the future, Tesla's will already be doing their part to reduce the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. So if you're passionate about this environmental issue, then buying a Tesla is a satisfying decision.

Tesla's brand is highly symbolic

This is after all the first successful new American car company to come along in decades, and the first all-electric automaker ever. The brands is, in a word, incredible. It's the envy of the auto industry.

If you want proof about how much pent-up love is out there for Tesla, look no further than the nearly 400,000 preorders that rolled in for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, revealed this past March. It was an unprecedented event — a huge number of customers putting down $1,000 each for a vehicle that wouldn't be built for almost two years.

These people weren't promising to buy a car — they were investing in a brand, and in Elon Musk's ability to execute. In effect, they were spending $1,000 each to join a club. In the past, it's cost on average $100,000 to get past the Tesla velvet rope. But not anymore.

Tesla's are pretty great cars

Don't believe me — check with Consumer Reports. When Consumer Reports tested an up-level trim of the Model S, the publication said that the vehicle broke its scale. It had never evaluated a better car.

Teslas are terrifically versatile and fun-to-drive vehicles. I've driven them all, from the original Roadster to the Model X SUV, and I got a joyride in the Model 3 prototype early this year. They're fast, comfortable, and technologically advanced.

The massive center touchscreen is the wave of the future as far as controlling infotainment and vehicle systems is concerned, and Autopilot sets the bar for semi-autonomous systems.

The design of the vehicles is durable, in the sense that a Tesla won't look dated in 5-7 years, which is the typical cycle for most other vehicles. The fit and finish isn't excessively luxurious, but it is well done and it appeals to a Silicon Valley minimalist mindset.

For road trips, the Model S can tote as much gear as an SUV and it's whisper quiet during freeway cruising. What's more, the Supercharger network is now well-established in the US, so longer trips aren't an issue, and Tesla has partnered with other charging systems to fill in any gaps.

Tesla doesn't just make great cars, though, they also provide a great ownership experience (which includes invites to Tesla's awesome parties, for what it's worth).

The best brands are built with love in mind. And obviously, Tesla is feeling plenty of love."

Troy Wolverton

Earlier this week, General Motors and its Cruise self-driving-car division staged their first demonstration for the media of all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles that can handle the streets of San Francisco without anybody's hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals.

As Business Insider's Troy Wolverton, who attended the event, reported, GM's autonomous Bolt's can't self-motor without hitches. But it's early days. The analogy that leaps to my mind is Kitty Hawk, the Wright brothers, and the dawn of flight. Orville and Wilbur made their first flight in 1903; passenger flight arrived a decade later, and by 1947, the sound barrier was broken by Chuck Yeager.

Self-driving cars don't have to fly, but Yeager didn't have to avoid airborne pedestrians on the way to 742 mph. The upshot is that what GM has achieved is prototypical spectacular: getting an autonomous vehicle to self-navigate a complicated urban streetscape is a profound achievement. And Cruise isn't the only GM effort. Cadillac rolled out its Super Cruise semi-self-driving system earlier this year, enabling fully hands-free highway piloting.

GM started working on Super Cruise several years back, bought Cruise Automation in 2016, and got the Bolt into production and up to sales that could hit 5,000 per month in about two years. This concerted undertaking to define the future of mobility is aimed squarely at the perceived leader on that score — Tesla.

Tesla takes all the risks

Tesla has been around for 14 years, and for most of that time, GM has been content to let Elon Musk and his company take on all the risks associated with electric and self-driving cars. But with three years of booming US sales under its belt and a healthy balance sheet, GM is ready to take its own risks.

And it's doing so like the global giant it is. Tesla has one factory, about 33,000 employees, and will sell a record 100,000 cars in 2017. GM has dozens of plants, over 200,000 employees, and builds a million vehicles a year. It isn't David vs. Goliath — it's David versus Goliath and all Goliath's relatives and friends.

The biggest threat to Tesla has never been that company can't innovate or craft a compelling story. It's been that after a decade-and-a-half, the Palo Alto-based carmaker doesn't yet have massive scale. If it can rapidly ramp up production of it's $35,000 Model 3, it could be making a million cars annually by 2020 — a tenth of what GM churns out.

In the auto industry, properly managed massiveness is a huge advantage. The mass-market math is simple: If you can manufacture more cars and trucks than the competition and do so profitable, you win. A lucrative cycle develops: you have more cash to develop innovative vehicles when times are good and the resources to defend and even capture market share when times are bad.

A sheltered Tesla

The Tesla Model 3. Timothy Artman/Tesla

Tesla has been sheltered from this dynamic for two reasons. First, it has been making only electric cars, and although it dominated this market, it's but a slice of a global EV market that represents on 1% of auto sales. Second, its cars up to this point have been high-priced luxury vehicles. That's a tough market, but it isn't a challenging as selling affordable vehicles to a large buyership.

The sheltering period is ending, and thus far for Tesla, the end has been humbling. A predicted 20,000 units in Model 3 production by December won't happen until March 2018 at the earliest. Tesla could have as many as 500,000 pre-orders for a vehicle that it's struggling to build. The company is burning over $1 billion per quarter, and although Wall Street has rewarded Tesla's growth prospects with a market cap that bigger than Ford's, GM spends a billion a month to build a million cars, while Tesla spends that much to deliver only around 25,000 in a quarter.

That which doesn't kill Tesla makes it stronger, and the company will likely emerge from this production Purgatory with its momentum intact. But aggressive, well-capitalized, seasoned competition has arrived much sooner than expected. All the things that Tesla is good at used to be the stuff that GM was bad at. But in just two years, GM has arguably gotten better at Tesla's stuff than Tesla is.

This doesn't mean that Tesla is facing an existential threat. But it does demonstrate that Tesla decade-and-a-half lead is fragile, particularly when it comes to self-driving technologies. GM was able to spend $1 billion all-in to buy Cruise. Tesla could use its stock to make similarly ambitious acquisitions, but Musk's focus now is on automated manufacturing, and that's where Tesla's M&A activity has been directed. But due to its relatively small size and inflexible balance sheet, Tesla is in constant danger of being swung from leading to playing catch-up.

Tesla's story is big, but GM is huge

I think GM did have a brief window when it could have put Tesla out of business, but the Detroit colossus wisely decided that the value of making Tesla go away was lower than continuing to use Tesla as an innovation lab funded by other people. As a result, GM recently rolled out a plan to develop a whopping 20 electric vehicles worldwide by 2023 and to use a profitable platform for those cars to enter new businesses in ride-hailing and ride-sharing, as well as data monetization.

GM is and always has been compulsively and practically macro; Tesla is telling a huge story, but as practical matter it's comparatively small. At its height in the immediate postwar period, one of every two cars sold in the US was a GM product; now it controls about 20% of the market. Tesla will have its best year ever in 2017 and hold only around 0.5% of the US market. Tesla thinks big, but it can't execute big. GM might not think as big as Tesla — although it's starting to — but it always plan to execute at a global, industrial scale, as it has for over a century.

This is where Tesla's connection to the technology industry and Silicon Valley is a hindrance. Facebook is major player in the 21st century economy, but compared to GM at the carmaker's peak, Facebook employs a tiny number of people and has a dinky physical footprint. The whole point is to have a massive effect on markets but to operate lean, using technology to leverage up and to enlist billions of users as a workforce. That works with software. But it doesn't with cars.

Tesla can outcompete — up to a point

Musk with Tesla's new Roadster. Tesla

We're witnessing this New Economy-Old Economy struggle play out with Tesla and GM. Up to a point, Tesla can outcompete GM. But only up to a point. Then the harsh realities of building large, expensive machines. and lots of them, kicks in.

In San Francisco, Tesla's back yard, GM took the first step toward putting everything together: EVs that drive themselves and that can be shared or hailed in a big city. Tesla isn't there yet.

But don't think that Musk is upset. He took Tesla to where it is today precisely so that the big guys like GM would join in his campaign to make cars cleaner and safer. GM is a a threat to Tesla — but it's a threat Tesla should welcome."

Lexus Sportcross.,"With Tesla’s Master Plan, Volume II set to debut tonight, we’re about to find out the next big phase of Elon Musk’s grand vision for the company. There is one detail we’re pretty sure about already – the company will no longer be officially “Tesla Motors,” but just “Tesla.”

Some of the more more poorly educated corners of the Internet have speculated that it has something to do with Tesla’s already-stated goal of becoming not just a car company, but a fully integrated transportation and energy provider. Musk himself even said it in the first master plan, back in 2006:

Build sports car Use that money to build an affordable car Use that money to build an even more affordable car While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options Don’t tell anyone.



And if you have at least one working eye and can read, you can clearly see where that line of thinking in those dimmer corners of the internet comes from.

It’s bullshit.

I know the REAL reason Tesla’s making the name change. Or rather, the many reasons. Here they are, listed below, in no order of importance:

Illuminati

They’re moving away from motors, from now on all vehicles will be sail-powered

Their big plan to re-animate Nikola is finally going to happen

“Apple Computer” went to just “Apple” and that seemed to work out okay

All the cool kids, like Shingy, have just one name

Illuminati

Tesla’s first car was based on a Lotus, so in keeping with its roots, it is adding lightness to its own name

TESLA MOTORS doesn’t work on knuckle tattoos, but TESLA on both hands does

Tiny humans

2Pac

Okay, does anyone really think all of this dumb branding stuff matters? It’s just a name, who really cares? This “Tesla” guy is dead anyway. And he was a bit of a kook known for being bad with money. If the company’s in the business of dropping names now, it should actually probably just drop the “Tesla.” Its cars are still powered by electric motors, so it makes sense to just call the entire shebang “Motors.” I suppose “General Motors” may have a lock on that one already, but “General” is such a formal, militaristic title. The Motors company, on the other hand, will be removing such pompous nomenclature, eliminating the barrier between it and its fans. Diddy did that, you know. When he got rid of the “P.” And maybe it’s something we can all learn from. That idea of eliminating barriers between ourselves. Eliminating that which keeps us apart, even in our etymological fortitude. Mmmm. Yeah. One love.

Illuminati

There’s a misconception that somehow battery-powered cars are more subject to damages than a gasoline-powered car in this situation. It didn’t help when Fisker famously lost $30 Million worth of cars in Hurricane Sandy, but to be fair, while advertised as an electric car, the Fisker Karma was more of a gas-powered car than an electric car anyway.

A recent video of a Tesla Model S driving (or swimming) passed cars with internal-combustion engines in a flooded tunnel in Russia Kazakhstan will maybe help correct those misconceptions.

The truth is that water is bad for any type of vehicle or any mechanical and electronic device for that matter.

You simply don’t want the entire undercarriage of your vehicle to be submerged regardless of if it consists of a large battery pack or an exhaust line. In the case of the Model S, the battery pack is sealed, but there are still plenty of complications from submerging the vehicle.

Furthermore, car warranties (including Tesla’s) or insurance rarely if ever cover any damage caused by driving through flooded streets.

It’s better not to try if it’s in any way avoidable, but if you are going to submerge your vehicle in water while it’s running, it’s pretty useful not to need any air intake. It is not clear if it was avoidable in this case, but a Tesla Model S driver shared this week an interesting video of his car going through a flooded tunnel:

I particularly like how he swerves left and right like the Model S is a wet dog getting out of the water.

Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared this article and commented:

We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2016

Although Musk studied physics and economics in college, he actually first learned about rockets by reading books.

In fact, Musk's connection with books goes beyond his latest successes.

""I was raised by books. Books, and then my parents,"" Musk said in an interview with reporter Neil Strauss for Rolling Stone's latest cover story.

Up until Musk was 8, he lived with both of his parents Maye and Errol Musk in South Africa, Strauss reported. But he did not see them much and mostly lived under the watch of a housekeeper, who Musk said was mainly there to make sure he didn't break anything.

""She wasn't, like, watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed,"" Musk told the magazine. ""I'm shocked that I have all my fingers.""

Throughout his childhood, books have played a crucial role in fueling Musk's ambitions. It's said that he read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica at age nine and would pore through science fiction novels for more than 10 hours a day.

When Musk's parents separated, Musk said he felt sad for his father and decided to move with him. In an interview in 2015, Errol told Forbes about how young Elon would have the most fun when reading books.

""Elon has always been an introvert thinker,"" Errol said. ""So where a lot of people would go to a great party and have a great time and drink and talk about all sorts of things like rugby or sport, you would find Elon had found the person's library and was going through their books.""

From his adolescence through today, here are eight books that shaped the revolutionary entrepreneur:"

But at his core, Musk is not a businessman or entrepreneur. He’s an engineer, inventor and, as he puts it, “technologist.” And as a naturally gifted engineer, he’s able to find the design inefficiencies, flaws and complete oversights in the tools that power our civilization.

For Rolling Stone‘s latest cover story, we spent nine months in the world of Elon Musk at: SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, OpenAI and the Boring Company – and in his home. Here, a few of the off-topic discussions we had along the way that didn’t make it into the main story.

Do you believe in God?

I try to let the weight of evidence determine my opinion.

Do you have a spiritual practice?

Not really. I believe in science.

What do you think happens when you die?

I think you cease to exist. I hope I’m wrong in a positive way. But most likely, you’re just gone.

Do you remember your last dream?

I do remember, but I’m not going to tell you.

Why?

Because I don’t wish to appear neurotic.

Do you think there are ideas to be had from dreams?

I think you need to be course-studied to read dreams as anything other than random.

What are you afraid of?

Extinction of human civilization.

Anything else?

I don’t think we should dwell on fear. It’s not productive. I have occasionally made decisions out of fear and they’ve generally been wrong.

Personal or work decisions?

Both. I found that almost always a decision made out of fear is the wrong decision.

Do you ever worry that other governments or industries are going to try to stop you?

Never attribute to malice that which can easily be explained by incompetence or stupidity, or not caring. Most of the time, people don’t care. If they’re not against you, they don’t think of you at all.

Are you concerned about your personal or company information getting hacked?

There are hacking attempts all the time. But the best defense is just to advance technology quickly – and others end up copying yesterday’s technology. A high rate of innovation is the best defense.

Do you think the end justifies the means?

It’s more like you want to maximize net good. The problems with the end justifies the means, is that if the means are incredibly horrible and they just spike up to good briefly at the end, then that’s not a good world. However, if there’s a short bit of bad and then a lot of good, the net good is high.

At what point do people on Mars start to consider themselves Martians?

I don’t know. When did people in America consider themselves Americans?

If the moon or Mars goes to war with the Earth—

Earth would win.

Do you have a practice or ritual that helps you think from a bigger perspective instead of getting caught in the day-to-day?

I sometimes think quietly. I get lost in thought. I’ll pace around the bedroom late at night. A day or two before I told people I would publish the Hyperloop paper, I realized, This thing doesn’t work. The equations don’t close. This is going to be very embarrassing. I was up all night and finally figured it out. I was quite stressed. I pace if I’m under pressure.

What’s the timeframe like from, “OK, I have this idea” to “I’m gonna present this idea” to “I’m gonna start working on this idea?”

Pretty short.

Do you look at making new things as puzzles or problem-solving?

Puzzles are solving a problem that has no point in and of itself. It’s just for the puzzle’s sake. I try to do useful things.

I had to drive a gas car recently and it felt like I was in—

A steam engine.

Do you think future generations are going to look back and think, “Why were people doing that?”

If somebody said you’re gonna pour the liquid remains of dinosaurs into your vehicle and burn them in order to move from one place to another, releasing toxic fumes – and by the way, you better not have your car on in a closed room cause you’re gonna die – you’d say, “Why are we doing that?” People drive basically parked in traffic with the air inlet for their cabin right in front of the exhaust pipe of another car. It’s insane. You’re sucking up the toxic gas from the car in front of you. You’re slowly poisoning yourself. Why don’t you just have a lick of arsenic while you’re at it?

Is it more motivating when people have faith in what you’re doing or when they don’t believe in you?

I’m not basing it on whether people have faith or not. I base it on the scientific method. I’m not going to take a vote for how many people think the world is round and base it on that. The world is round.

So when scientists discovered than an electron can be in two places at once, how do you—

I don’t think it can be in two places at once. I think it’s rendered as we see it. Dynamic rendering. That explains quantum probability.

Do you ever wish that Twitter was around when people like Edison and Tesla were alive?

That would be cool. Edison and Tesla both did great things. Edison’s issue was that he was a bit of a dick. Tesla’s issue is that he went crazy and started talking to pigeons. Nobody’s perfect.

Do you ever think about how you’re going to keep all your projects going when you’re not here?

That would be great. You don’t know how to do that, do you?"

The billionaire entrepreneur who made a cameo as himself in Iron Man 2 just unveiled his latest creation: the Tesla Truck.

Tesla

One of Musk's Tesla designers recently described the genesis of electric semi-truck idea to Rolling Stone: ""We just thought, 'What do people want? They want reliability. They want the lowest cost. And they want driver comfort,'"" Jerome Guillen said. ""So we reimagined the truck.""

The Tesla Semi, as it's known, will have a 500-mile range and be able to travel in a convoy, where one or several trucks will be able to autonomously follow a lead Semi. Reservations can be made for $5,000 per truck, and production will begin in 2019.

In addition to revealing the design for the truck at an event Thursday night, Musk announced that Tesla is creating a new version of its Roadster.

The Tesla roadster can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds, making it the fastest-accelerating production car ever created. Tesla

The sleek sports car, which the company last produced in 2012, will start at $200,000. A $50,000 deposit is required for a reservation.

Next up, if Musk gets his way, is a supersonic electric jet that can take off and land vertically. While that may not come to fruition for some time, Musk's Tesla vehicles are very much a reality. The current range includes the Model S and new $35,000 Model 3 sedans, along with the Model X SUV.

.

Before Tesla, Musk made his initial fortune after selling his company PayPal to eBay for $180 million (after taxes) in 2002. That's a lot of money, to be sure, but nothing close to the $20 billion that his rocket company SpaceX is reportedly worth today.

On his own, Musk is reportedly worth between $19.6 billion and $20 billion. That puts the 46-year-old at number 21 on this year's Forbes 400 list. If his past success is an indication of what the future holds, the sky—or in Musk's case, Mars‚ which he wants to colonize—is the limit."

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Elon Musk needs no introduction.

Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Elon Musk and the energy he brings to the business world. His major companies include: Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, HyperLoop, Solar City, and Giga Factory.

All Musk companies have a major theme, vision and technology.

These companies all have one major theme in common; they are set on pushing boundaries. In fact, this innovative concept has practically become synonymous with Musk’s name.

Related: Elon Musk News & Topics

Combined with groundbreaking technology and a strong passion for improving life (both in and outside of Earth), Musk’s unique vision is one of the most valuable contributions in bringing humanity to the next level.

One his quotes has always stuck with me: “If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not.”

Musk, the most influential entrepreneur today.

Musk is the most influential entrepreneur of our generation. His approach has inspired many others to try new things and to make a real difference in the world. So what is it about his formula that is so special?

Related: 7 Takeaways in the Success of Elon Musk for Young Entrepreneurs

Well, truth be told, it’s really not that complicated. The bulk of his strategy can be traced back to several key cornerstones.

Musk is committed to challenging convention.

One of the traits that makes Elon Musk so influential is his keen eye for understanding human truth. In essence, human truth encapsulates the deeper meaning behind universally-accepted status quos. In other words, it is the common thoughts and feelings that unite us all.

Musk’s formula for innovation starts by identifying the what and the why of certain pain points in day-to-day life. One of his more recent ideas, from SpaceX towers, aims to change the very perception of air travel.

What is human truth?

The human truth of air travel is that most people do not genuinely enjoy spending hours on a cramped airplane. Travelers like to get to their destinations as quickly as humanly possible. Musk’s ambitious plan is to create a revolutionary rocket system that transports passengers from any one city to another in under an hour.

For instance, a flight from New York City to Los Angeles would take roughly 25 minutes. Perhaps the best part of the plan; tickets will cost as much as a typical economy-class ticket. If you haven’t seen the videos, definitely check out part one and two.

This is not Musk’s only idea (both past and present) to challenge convention. Throughout each idea, the driving force effectively finds inefficiencies and works to create solutions that have never been done before. In many cases with Musk’s ideas, have never even been fathomed.

Musk understand everyone involved is a vector.

Recently, Dharmesh Shah, founder of HubSpot, got the opportunity to meet and converse with Musk at a dinner for legendary founders at Sequoia Capital. Like so many others, Shah wanted to know what Musk does to create a successful company. Shah asked him: “What’s your advice to build a great company that grows every day?”

Musk is a physics man, and his response reflected this fact perfectly. He told Shah to think of it in simple terms of getting a company from point A to point B. Each person within an operation is a vector that exerts energy to achieve this goal. Everyone has a quantity of both magnitude and direction.

Related: 5 Learnings From Entrepreneurial Journey of Elon Musk

A company’s progress is determined by the sum of all these vectors. If some vectors are exerting energy in one direction, while others are doing so in a different direction, the impact will be sub-optimal. For example, if an employee is exerting a force of 10 in one way, and another is exerting a force of 10 in the opposite, the total impact is zero.

For a company to achieve maximum impact, all vectors must be exerting energy in the same direction. In short, for a company to thrive, all parties must be consistently devoting their efforts to a common vision.

Firmly align team goals with customer needs.

One of the biggest problems that plague many companies is a misalignment with internal team goals. When this is the case, misalignment with the customers’ needs is all but inevitable. Maintaining common goals within a company gets more and more complicated throughout growth; even more so when third-parties are introduced to the mix.

One of the basic human truths Musk factors into his business plans is that all people want a positive end-to-end customer experience. A stellar end-to-end customer experience involves outstanding products, sales strategies, and service options. Throughout each venture, Musk’s primary goal is to ensure these components happen.

Related: Elon Musk Personally Cancels 'Super Rude' Customer's Tesla Model

Perhaps the best example is with his famous Tesla car. Many of the major car companies we know follow a common business model. While most have their own stores, a good portion of the sales aspect comes from third-party dealerships. Throughout this process, the unique brand values are being filtered through a number of different visions and mentalities. In turn, it becomes incredibly easy for core values to get lost in translation.

At Tesla, the authentic products are exclusively sold at their own stores. There are no outside dealerships involved to aid the sales cycle. Service options are available from branded Tesla centers. The Tesla computer system within the cars conducts all of its own updates and is equipped with technology to seamlessly guide users to the nearest Tesla charging stations.

If a user wants to sell their vehicle, they can do so through the Tesla website. At no point in the customer experience does the user need to branch out to any outside parties for assistance. When this is the case, keeping team goals aligned with customer needs is much easier and branded values do not run the risk of being muddled by external mindsets.

Conclusion.

Elon Musk has already made a significant impact in improving the way we live. His superlative knowledge and dedication to the greater good is truly a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.

Reuters/Mike Blake

HAWTHORNE, California — On Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn't just announce his plans to remake the trucking industry. He also served notice to rail carriers.

Unveiling Tesla's new Semi Truck, Musk crunched the numbers for the agog crowd: A traditional diesel truck can be operated for $1.51 a mile; the Tesla Semi, he said, beats that with $1.26.

But it gets better. Using convoys — Tesla Semis yoked together with connected Autopilot technology, operating like road-going trains, with one semi as the leader — Tesla's cost drops to $0.85 a mile.

""This beats rail,"" Musk said.

He said Tesla could execute on convoying technology now, so it's really just a matter of a customer buying enough Semis to create the train.

Obviously, rail still has some advantages, such as being able to operate at relatively high continuous speed without stopping over great distances and without needing to refuel. Rail also saves wear and tear on roadways.

But Tesla's freight economics are starting to look quite impressive."

To launch them -- and to answer any complex question -- he uses the same approach each time, he told Rolling Stone reporter Neil Strauss.

It's ""the scientific method,"" Musk said. ""It's really helpful for figuring out the tricky things."" He describes his process this way, according to Strauss:

1. Ask a question.



2. Gather as much evidence as possible about it.



3. Develop axioms based on the evidence, and try to assign a probability of truth to each one.



4. Draw a conclusion based on cogency in order to determine: Are these axioms correct, are they relevant, do they necessarily lead to this conclusion, and with what probability?

5. Attempt to disprove the conclusion. Seek refutation from others to further help break your conclusion.

6. If nobody can invalidate your conclusion, then you're probably right, but you're not certainly right.

Musk utilizes these six questions any time he needs to come up with an idea, solve a problem, or decide to start a business. He values this kind of evidence-based decision making, and criticized individuals who can't separate fact from

Most people employ ""It's true because I said it's true,"" he told Strauss. ""It's very unscientific.""

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also has a set framework for decision-making. In a 2016 shareholder letter, he distinguished between Type 1 and Type 2 decisions.

Type 1 decisions are ""are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible - one-way doors - and these decisions must be made methodically,"" Bezos wrote. Type 2 decisions are ""changeable, reversible - they’re two-way doors,"" which ""can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups."""

Musk is wearing a gray T-shirt and sitting in a swivel chair at his desk, which is not in a private office behind a closed door, but in an accessible corner cubicle festooned with outer-space novelty items, photos of his rockets, and mementos from Tesla and his other companies.

Most tellingly, there’s a framed poster of a shooting star with a caption underneath it that reads, “When you wish upon a falling star, your dreams can come true. Unless it’s really a meteor hurtling to the Earth which will destroy all life. Then you’re pretty much hosed, no matter what you wish for. Unless it’s death by meteorite.” To most people, this would be mere dark humor, but in this setting, it’s also a reminder of Musk’s master plan: to create habitats for humanity on other planets and moons. If we don’t send our civilization into another Dark Ages before Musk or one of his dream’s inheritors pull it off, then Musk will likely be remembered as one of the most seminal figures of this millennium. Kids on all the terraformed planets of the universe will look forward to Musk Day, when they get the day off to commemorate the birth of the Earthling who single-handedly ushered in the era of space colonization.

And that’s just one of Musk’s ambitions. Others include converting automobiles, households and as much industry as possible from fossil fuels to sustainable energy; implementing a new form of high-speed city-to-city transportation via vacuum tube; relieving traffic congestion with a honeycomb of underground tunnels fitted with electric skates for cars and commuters; creating a mind-computer interface to enhance human health and brainpower; and saving humanity from the future threat of an artificial intelligence that may one day run amok and decide, quite rationally, to eliminate the irrational human species.

So far, Musk, 46, has accomplished none of these goals.

But what he has done is something that very few living people can claim: Painstakingly bulldozed, with no experience whatsoever, into two fields with ridiculously high barriers to entry – car manufacturing (Tesla) and rocketry (SpaceX) – and created the best products in those industries, as measured by just about any meaningful metric you can think of. In the process, he’s managed to sell the world on his capability to achieve objectives so lofty that from the mouth of anyone else, they’d be called fantasies.

At least, most of the world. “I’m looking at the short losses,” Musk says, transfixed by CNBC on his iPhone. He speaks to his kids without looking up. “Guys, check this out: Tesla has the highest short position in the entire stock market. A $9 billion short position.”

His children lean over the phone, looking at a table full of numbers that I don’t understand. So his 13-year-old, Griffin, explains it to me: “They’re betting that the stock goes down, and they’re getting money off that. But it went up high, so they lost an insane amount of money.”

“They’re jerks who want us to die,” Musk elaborates. “They’re constantly trying to make up false rumors and amplify any negative rumors. It’s a really big incentive to lie and attack my integrity. It’s really awful. It’s…”

He trails off, as he often does when preoccupied by a thought. I try to help: “Unethical?”

“It’s…” He shakes his head and struggles for the right word, then says softly, “Hurtful.”

It is easy to confuse who someone is with what they do, and thus turn them into a caricature who fits neatly into a storybook view of the world. Our culture always needs villains and heroes, fools and geniuses, scapegoats and role models. However, despite opinions to the contrary, Elon Musk is not a robot sent from the future to save humanity. Nor is he a Silicon Valley savant whose emotional affect has been replaced with supercomputer-like intelligence. Over the course of nine months of reporting, watching Musk do everything from strategize Mars landings with his rocket-engineering team to plan the next breakthroughs with his artificial-intelligence experts, I learned he is someone far, far different from what his myth and reputation suggest.

The New York Times has called him “arguably the most successful and important entrepreneur in the world.” It’s an easy case to make: He’s probably the only person who has started four billion-dollar companies – PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX and Solar City. But at his core, Musk is not a businessman or entrepreneur. He’s an engineer, inventor and, as he puts it, “technologist.” And as a naturally gifted engineer, he’s able to find the design inefficiencies, flaws and complete oversights in the tools that power our civilization.

“He’s able to see things more clearly in a way that no one else I know of can understand,” says his brother, Kimbal. He discusses his brother’s love of chess in their earlier years, and adds, “There’s a thing in chess where you can see 12 moves ahead if you’re a grandmaster. And in any particular situation, Elon can see things 12 moves ahead.”

His children soon leave for the home of their mother, Musk’s ex-wife Justine. “I wish we could be private with Tesla,” Musk murmurs as they exit. “It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.”

What follows is … silence. Musk sits at his desk, looking at his phone, but not typing or reading anything. He then lowers himself to the floor, and stretches his back on a foam roller. When he finishes, I attempt to start the interview by asking about the Tesla Model 3 launch a week earlier, and what it felt like to stand onstage and tell the world he’d just pulled off a plan 14 years in the making: to bootstrap, with luxury electric cars, a mass-market electric car.

The accomplishment, for Musk, is not just in making a $35,000 electric car; it’s in making a $35,000 electric car that’s so good, and so in-demand, that it forces other car manufacturers to phase out gas cars to compete. And sure enough, within two months of the launch, both GM and Jaguar Land Rover announced they were planning to eliminate gas cars and go all-electric.

Musk thinks for a while, begins to answer, then pauses. “Uh, actually, let me go to the restroom. Then I’ll ask you to repeat that question.” A longer pause. “I also have to unload other things from my mind.”

Five minutes later, Musk still hasn’t returned. Sam Teller, his chief of staff, says, “I’ll be right back.”

Several minutes after that, they both reappear and huddle nearby, whispering to each other. Then Musk returns to his desk.

“We can reschedule for another day if this is a bad time,” I offer.

Musk clasps his hands on the surface of the desk, composes himself, and declines.

“It might take me a little while to get into the rhythm of things.”

Then he heaves a sigh and ends his effort at composure. “I just broke up with my girlfriend,” he says hesitantly. “I was really in love, and it hurt bad.”

He pauses and corrects himself: “Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think.”

Thus, the answer to the question posed earlier: It felt unexpectedly, disappointingly, uncontrollably horrible to launch the Model 3. “I’ve been in severe emotional pain for the last few weeks,” Musk elaborates. “Severe. It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around. For most of that day, I was morbid. And then I had to psych myself up: drink a couple of Red Bulls, hang out with positive people and then, like, tell myself: ‘I have all these people depending on me. All right, do it!'”

Minutes before the event, after meditating for pretty much the first time in his life to get centered, Musk chose a very telling song to drive onstage to: “R U Mine?” by the Arctic Monkeys.

Musk discusses the breakup for a few more minutes, then asks, earnestly, deadpan, “Is there anybody you think I should date? It’s so hard for me to even meet people.” He swallows and clarifies, stammering softly, “I’m looking for a long-term relationship. I’m not looking for a one-night stand. I’m looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing.”

I eventually tell him that it may not be a good idea to jump right into another relationship. He may want to take some time to himself and figure out why his previous relationships haven’t worked in the long run: his marriage to writer Justine Musk, his marriage to actress Talulah Riley, and this new breakup with actress Amber Heard.

Musk shakes his head and grimaces: “If I’m not in love, if I’m not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy.”

I explain that needing someone so badly that you feel like nothing without them is textbook codependence.

Musk disagrees. Strongly. “It’s not true,” he replies petulantly. “I will never be happy without having someone. Going to sleep alone kills me.” He hesitates, shakes his head, falters, continues. “It’s not like I don’t know what that feels like: Being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there – and no one on the pillow next to you. Fuck. How do you make yourself happy in a situation like that?”

There’s truth to what Musk is saying. It is lonely at the top. But not for everyone. It’s lonely at the top for those who were lonely at the bottom.

“When I was a child, there’s one thing I said,” Musk continues. His demeanor is stiff, yet in the sheen of his eyes and the trembling of his lips, a high tide of emotion is visible, pushing against the retaining walls. “‘I never want to be alone.’ That’s what I would say.” His voice drops to a whisper. “I don’t want to be alone.”

A ring of red forms around his eyes as he stares forward and sits frozen in silence. Musk is a titan, a visionary, a human-size lever pushing forward massive historical inevitabilities – the kind of person who comes around only a few times in a century – but in this moment, he seems like a child who is afraid of abandonment. And that may be the origin story of Musk’s superambitions, but more on that later. In the meantime, Musk has something he’d like to show me.

“If you say anything about what you’re about to see, it would cost us billions,” he says, rising from his desk. “And you would be put in jail.”

The most interesting tourist attraction in Los Angeles County is one that’s not in many guidebooks: It’s in the otherwise-untouristed southwestern city of Hawthorne, around SpaceX. If you walk along Crenshaw Boulevard from Jack Northrop Boulevard to 120th Street, what you will see is a city of the future that’s under construction. This is Musk city, an alternate reality, a triumph of futuristic imagination more thrilling than anything at a Disney park. On the west side of the street, a 156-foot-tall rocket towers above SpaceX headquarters, symbolizing Musk’s dream of relatively low-cost interplanetary travel. This particular rocket booster was the first in human history to be launched into space, then recovered intact on Earth after separating, and then fired back into space. On the east side of the street, an employee parking lot has been dug up and turned into the first-ever tunnel for the Boring Company, Musk’s underground-honeycomb solution to traffic jams and the future home of all his terrestrial transportation projects. Then, running for a mile beside Jack Northrop Boulevard, there’s a white vacuum tube along the shoulder of the road. This is the test track for the Hyperloop, Musk’s high-speed form of city-to-city travel. Taken together, the dreams of Musk city promise to connect the planet and the solar system in ways that will fundamentally change humanity’s relationship to two of the most important facets of its reality: distance and time.

But there is a particular building in Musk city that few have visited, and this is where Musk takes me. It is the Tesla Design Studio, where he’s slated to do a walkthrough of the Tesla Truck and other future vehicle prototypes with his team of designers and engineers.

Outside the door, a guard takes my phone and audio recorder, and I’m given an old-fashioned pen and paper to take notes on. Musk then continues into the building and reveals the Tesla Truck, which aims to help the trucking industry go green. (Musk has even been toying with creating a supersonic electric jet, with vertical takeoff and landing, in the future.) Four key members of the Tesla team are there – Doug Field, JB Straubel, Franz von Holzhausen, Jerome Guillen – and watch with anticipation as Musk explores a new configuration of the cab for the first time.

Guillen explains the idea behind the truck: “We just thought, ‘What do people want? They want reliability. They want the lowest cost. And they want driver comfort.’ So we reimagined the truck.”

This is a perfect example of the idea that Musk-inspired wannabe visionaries around the world worship like a religion: first principles thinking. In other words, if you want to create or innovate, start from a clean slate. Don’t accept any ideas, practices or standards just because everyone else is doing them. For instance, if you want to make a truck, then it must be able to reliably move cargo from one location to another, and you must follow existing laws of physics. Everything else is negotiable, including government regulations. As long as you remember that the goal isn’t to reinvent the truck, but to create the best one, whether or not it’s similar to past trucks.

As a result of this type of thinking, Musk is able to see an industry much more objectively than others who’ve been in the field their whole lives.

“I was literally told this is impossible and I’m a huge liar,” Musk says of the early days of Tesla. “But I have a car and you can drive it. This is not like a frigging unicorn. It’s real. Go for a drive. It’s amazing. How can you be in denial?”

An unfortunate fact of human nature is that when people make up their mind about something, they tend not to change it – even when confronted with facts to the contrary. “It’s very unscientific,” Musk says. “There’s this thing called physics, which is this scientific method that’s really quite effective for figuring out the truth.”

The scientific method is a phrase Musk uses often when asked how he came up with an idea, solved a problem or chose to start a business. Here’s how he defines it for his purposes, in mostly his own words:

1. Ask a question.

2. Gather as much evidence as possible about it.

3. Develop axioms based on the evidence, and try to assign a probability of truth to each one.

4. Draw a conclusion based on cogency in order to determine: Are these axioms correct, are they relevant, do they necessarily lead to this conclusion, and with what probability? 5. Attempt to disprove the conclusion. Seek refutation from others to further help break your conclusion. 6. If nobody can invalidate your conclusion, then you’re probably right, but you’re not certainly right.

“That’s the scientific method,” Musk concludes. “It’s really helpful for figuring out the tricky things.”

But most people don’t use it, he says. They engage in wishful thinking. They ignore counterarguments. They form conclusions based on what others are doing and aren’t doing. The reasoning that results is “It’s true because I said it’s true,” but not because it’s objectively true.

“The fundamental intention of Tesla, at least my motivation,” Musk explains in his halting, stuttering voice, “was to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. That’s why I open-sourced the patents. It’s the only way to transition to sustainable energy better.

“Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI,” he continues. “I keep telling people this. I hate to be Cassandra here, but it’s all fun and games until somebody loses a fucking eye. This view [of climate change] is shared by almost everyone who’s not crazy in the scientific community.”

For the next 20 minutes, Musk examines the Tesla Truck. He comments first on the technical details, even ones as granular as the drawbacks and advantages of different types of welding. He then moves on to the design, specifically a driver-comfort feature that cannot be specified here, due to said threatened jail time.

“Probably no one will buy it because of this,” he tells his team. “But if you’re going to make a product, make it beautiful. Even if it doesn’t affect sales, I want it to be beautiful.”

According to Musk’s best guess, our personalities might be 80 percent nature and 20 percent nurture. Whatever that ratio actually is, if you want to understand the future that Musk is building, it’s essential to understand the past that built him, including his fears of human extinction and being alone.

For the first eight or so years of his life, Musk lived with his mother, Maye, a dietitian and model, and his father, Errol, an engineer, in Pretoria, South Africa. He rarely saw either of them.

“I didn’t really have a primary nanny or anything,” Musk recalls. “I just had a housekeeper who was there to make sure I didn’t break anything. She wasn’t, like, watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed. I’m shocked that I have all my fingers.” He raises his hands and examines them, then lowers his digits. “I was raised by books. Books, and then my parents.”

Some of those books help explain the world Musk is building, particularly Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series. The books are centered around the work of a visionary named Hari Seldon, who has invented a scientific method of predicting the future based on crowd behavior. He sees a 30,000-year Dark Ages waiting ahead for humankind, and creates a plan that involves sending scientific colonies to distant planets to help civilization mitigate this unavoidable cataclysm.

“Asimov certainly was influential because he was seriously paralleling Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, but he applied that to a sort of modern galactic empire,” Musk explains. “The lesson I drew from that is you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one.”

Musk was around 10 at this time, and plunged in his own personal dark age. He’d recently made a move that would change his life. It was a wrong decision that came from the right place.

When his parents split up two years before, he and his younger siblings – Kimbal and Tosca – stayed with their mom. But, Musk recounts, “I felt sorry for my father, because my mother had all three kids. He seemed very sad and lonely by himself. So I thought, ‘I can be company.'” He pauses while a movie’s worth of images seem to flicker through his mind.

“Yeah, I was sad for my father. But I didn’t really understand at the time what kind of person he was.”

He lets out a long, sad sigh, then says flatly about moving in with Dad, “It was not a good idea.”

According to Elon, Errol has an extremely high IQ – “brilliant at engineering, brilliant” – and was supposedly the youngest person to get a professional engineer’s qualification in South Africa. When Elon came to live with him in Lone Hill, a suburb of Johannesburg, Errol was, by his own account, making money in the often dangerous worlds of construction and emerald mining – at times so much that he claims he couldn’t close his safe.

“I’m naturally good at engineering that’s because I inherited it from my father,” Musk says. “What’s very difficult for others is easy for me. For a while, I thought things were so obvious that everyone must know this.”

Like what kinds of things?

“Well, like how the wiring in a house works. And a circuit breaker, and alternating current and direct current, what amps and volts were, how to mix a fuel and oxidizers to create an explosive. I thought everyone knew this.”

But there was another side to Musk’s father that was just as important to making Elon who he is. “He was such a terrible human being,” Musk shares. “You have no idea.” His voice trembles, and he discusses a few of those things, but doesn’t go into specifics. “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil,” he says. “He will plan evil.”

Besides emotional abuse, did that include physical abuse?

“My dad was not physically violent with me. He was only physically violent when I was very young.” (Errol countered via email that he only “smacked” Elon once, “on the bottom.”)

Elon’s eyes turn red as he continues discussing his dad. “You have no idea about how bad. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. Um…”

There is clearly something Musk wants to share, but he can’t bring himself to utter the words, at least not on the record. “It’s so terrible, you can’t believe it.”

The tears run silently down his face. “I can’t remember the last time I cried.” He turns to Teller to confirm this. “You’ve never seen me cry.”

“No,” Teller says. “I’ve never seen you cry.”

The flow of tears stops as quickly as it began. And once more, Musk has the cold, impassive, but gentle stone face that is more familiar to the outside world.

Yet it’s now clear that this is not the face of someone without emotions, but the face of someone with a lot of emotions who had been forced to suppress them in order to survive a painful childhood.

When asked about committing crimes, Musk’s father said that he has never intentionally threatened or hurt anyone, or been charged with anything, except … in this one case, he says he shot and killed three out of five or six armed people who broke into his home, and was later cleared of all charges on self-defense.

In his e-mail, Errol wrote: “I’ve been accused of being a Gay, a Misogynist, a Paedophile, a Traitor, a Rat, a Shit (quite often), a Bastard (by many women whose attentions I did not return) and much more. My own (wonderful) mother told me I am ‘ruthless’ and should learn to be more ‘humane.'” But, he concluded, “I love my children and would readily do whatever for them.”

As an adult, Musk, with the same optimism with which he moved in with his father as a child, moved his dad, his father’s then-wife and their children to Malibu. He bought them a house, cars and a boat. But his father, Elon says, hadn’t changed, and Elon severed the relationship.

“In my experience, there is nothing you can do,” he says about finally learning the lesson that his dad will never change. “Nothing, nothing. I wish. I’ve tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he… no way, it just got worse.”

Somewhere in this trauma bond is the key to Musk’s worldview – creation against destruction, of being useful versus harmful, of defending the world against evil.

Things at school weren’t much better than life at home. There, Musk was brutally bullied – until he was 15 years old.

“For the longest time, I was the youngest and the smallest kid in the class because my birthday just happens to fall on almost the last day that they will accept you into school, June 28th. And I was a late bloomer. So I was the youngest and the smallest kid in class for years and years. …The gangs at school would hunt me down – literally hunt me down!”

Musk put down the books and started learning to fight back – karate, judo, wrestling. That physical education, combined with a growth spurt that brought him to six feet by age 16, gave him some confidence and, as he puts it, “I started dishing it out as hard as they’d give it to me.”

When he got into a fight with the biggest bully at school and knocked him out with one punch, Musk noticed that the bully never picked on him again. “It taught me a lesson: If you’re fighting a bully, you cannot appease a bully.” Musk speaks the next words forcefully. “You punch the bully in the nose. Bullies are looking for targets that won’t fight back. If you make yourself a hard target and punch the bully in the nose, he’s going to beat the shit out of you, but he’s actually not going to hit you again.”

When he was 17, Musk left college and moved to his mother’s home country, Canada, later obtaining passports for his mother, brother and sister to join him there. His father did not wish him well, Musk recalls. “He said rather contentiously that I’d be back in three months, that I’m never going to make it, that I’m never going to make anything of myself. He called me an idiot all the time. That’s the tip of the iceberg, by the way.”

After Musk became successful, his father even took credit for helping him – to such a degree that it’s listed as fact in Elon’s Wikipedia entry. “One thing he claims is he gave us a whole bunch of money to start, my brother and I, to start up our first company [Zip2, which provided online city guides to newspapers]. This is not true,” Musk says. “He was irrelevant. He paid nothing for college. My brother and I paid for college through scholarships, loans and working two jobs simultaneously. The funding we raised for our first company came from a small group of random angel investors in Silicon Valley.”

Musk’s career history decorates his desk. There’s an item from nearly all of his companies, even a mug for X.com, the early online bank he started, which became PayPal. The sale of Zip2 resulted in a $22 million check made out directly to Musk, which he used in part to start X.com. With the roughly $180 million post-tax amount he made from the sale of PayPal, he started SpaceX with $100 million, put $70 million into Tesla, invested $10 million into Solar City, and saved little for himself.

One of the misunderstandings that rankles Musk most is being pigeonholed and narrowcast, whether as the real-life Tony Stark or the second coming of Steve Jobs. When, at a photo shoot, he was asked to wear a black turtleneck, the trademark garb of Jobs, he bristled. “If I was dying and I had a turtleneck on,” he tells me, “with my last dying breath, I would take the turtleneck off and try to throw it as far away from my body as possible.”

So what is Musk about?

“I try to do useful things,” he explains. “That’s a nice aspiration. And useful means it is of value to the rest of society. Are they useful things that work and make people’s lives better, make the future seem better, and actually are better, too? I think we should try to make the future better.”

When asked to define “better,” Musk elaborates, “It would be better if we mitigated the effects of global warming and had cleaner air in our cities and weren’t drilling for vast amounts of coal, oil and gas in parts of the world that are problematic and will run out anyway.

“And if we were a multiplanetary species, that would reduce the possibility of some single event, man-made or natural, taking out civilization as we know it, as it did the dinosaurs. There have been five mass-extinction events in the fossil record. People have no comprehension of these things. Unless you’re a cockroach or a mushroom – or a sponge – you’re fucked.” He laughs sharply. “It’s insurance of life as we know it, and it makes the future far more inspiring if we are out there among the stars and you could move to another planet if you wanted to.”

This, then, is the ideology of Musk. And though basic, it’s actually very rare. Think of the other names that one associates with innovation this century: They’re people who built operating systems, devices, websites or social-media platforms. Even when it didn’t start out that way, the ideology in most cases soon became: How can I make my company the center of my users’ world? Consequently, social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter use a number of tricks to activate the addictive reward centers of a user’s brain.

If Musk’s employees suggested doing something like this, he’d probably look at them like they were crazy. This type of thinking doesn’t compute. “It’s really inconsistent to not be the way you want the world to be,” he says flatly, “and then through some means of trickery, operate according to one moral code while the rest of the world operates according to a different one. This is obviously not something that works. If everyone’s trying to trick everyone all the time, it’s a lot of noise and confusion. It’s better just to be straightforward and try to do useful things.”

He discusses building a permanent moon base, and further funding SpaceX by creating passenger rockets capable of traveling to any city in the world in less than an hour, a form of transport he calls “Earth-to-Earth.” I ask if there’s anything that he believes works that surprises people.

“I think being precise about the truth works. Truthful and precise. I try to tell people, ‘You don’t have to read between the lines with me. I’m saying the lines!'”

On another occasion, I watch Musk at a weekly SpaceX engineering-team meeting, where eight experts sit around a table in high-backed red chairs, showing Musk a PowerPoint with the latest updates to the Mars spaceship design. And while Musk keeps pace on technical details with some of the most brilliant minds in aerospace, he also adds an element that goes beyond logistics and engineering.

“Make sure it doesn’t look ugly or something,” he advises at one point. Then, later, “The aesthetics of this one are not so great. It looks like a scared lizard.” And, in a characteristically wry moment, “When you land on Mars, you want the list of what you have to worry about to be small enough that you’re not dead.”

Overall, there’s a theme to Musk’s feedback: First, things have to be useful, logical and scientifically possible.

Then he looks to improve efficiency on every level: What are people accepting as an industry standard when there’s room for significant improvement?

From there, Musk pushes for the end product to be aesthetically beautiful, simple, cool, sleek (“He hates seams,” says one staffer) and, as Musk puts it at one point in the meeting, “awesome.”

Throughout this process, there’s an additional element that very few companies indulge in: personalization. This usually involves Musk adding Easter eggs and personal references to the products, such as making the Tesla sound-system volume go to 11 (in homage to Spinal Tap) or sending a “secret payload” into space in his first Dragon launch that turned out to be a wheel of cheese (in homage to Monty Python).

Beyond all this, most maddening or exciting for Musk’s employees, depending on which one you ask, is the time scale on which he often expects work to be done. For example, one Friday when I was visiting, a few SpaceX staff members were frantically rushing back and forth from the office to the parking lot across the street. It turns out that during a meeting, he asked them how long it would take to remove staff cars from the lot and start digging the first hole for the Boring Company tunnel. The answer: two weeks.

Musk asked why, and when he gathered the necessary information, he concluded, “Let’s get started today and see what’s the biggest hole we can dig between now and Sunday afternoon, running 24 hours a day.” Within three hours, the cars were gone and there was a hole in the ground.

On the other hand, one thing Musk is notorious for is setting ambitious deadlines that he often can’t meet. The Roadster, the Model S and the Model X were all delayed from his original timeline, and now the Model 3 – with its nearly half-a-million-person-long waiting list – is experiencing its own production delays. There are many reasons for this, but Musk summarizes: “Better to do something good and be late than bad and be early.” So expect Musk to get it done, just not on time. Because if he can’t do it, he won’t pretend otherwise.

“I expect to lose,” Musk says. He’s in a three-story building in San Francisco that has only recently been furnished. It used to belong to Stripe, the credit-card payment processor, but now belongs to Musk, who’s housing two of his companies there: Neuralink and OpenAI.

These are visions of what Tesla or SpaceX may have looked like when they first began. A small group of excited people working with limited resources to hit a distant, ambitious target. But unlike Tesla and SpaceX, there aren’t anything close to road maps toward these goals, nor are they so clear-cut.

OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.

If it sounds like those are contradictory ideas, think again. Neuralink allows our brains to keep up in the intelligence race. The machines can’t outsmart us if we have everything the machines have plus everything we have. At least, that is if you assume that what we have is actually an advantage.

It’s an unusual day at the office: Musk is showing a documentary about artificial intelligence to the Neuralink staff. He stands in front of them as they sit splayed on couches and chairs, and lays out the grim odds of his mission to make AI safe: “Maybe there’s a five to 10 percent chance of success,” he says.

The challenge he’s up against with OpenAI is twofold. First, the problem with building something that’s smarter than you is … that it’s smarter than you. Add to that the fact that AI has no remorse, no morality, no emotions – and humanity may be in deep shit. This is the good son’s second chance against the remorseless father he couldn’t change.

The other challenge is that OpenAI is a nonprofit, and it’s competing with the immense resources of Google’s DeepMind. Musk tells the group he in fact invested in DeepMind with the intention of keeping a watchful eye on Google’s AI development.

“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” he elaborates to me. “There’s a lot of risk in concentration of power. So if AGI [artificial general intelligence] represents an extreme level of power, should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?”

“Sleep well,” Musk jokes when the movie ends. He then leads a discussion about it, writing down some ideas and bluntly dismissing others. As he’s speaking, he reaches into a bowl, grabs a piece of popcorn, drops it in his mouth and starts coughing.

“We’re talking about threats to humanity,” he mutters, “and I’m going to choke to death on popcorn.”

It is 9 p.m. on a Thursday night, and I’m waiting in the foyer of Musk’s Bel Air home for our final interview. He walks down the stairs a few minutes later, wearing a T-shirt depicting Mickey Mouse in space. A tall blond woman follows him down the stairs.

He is, true to his words, not alone.

The woman, it turns out, is Talulah Riley, his second wife. They met in 2008, and Musk proposed after 10 days together. They married in 2010, then divorced two years later, then remarried the following year, then filed for divorce again, then withdrew the filing, then re-filed for divorce and finally followed through with it.

Musk suggests doing something rare for him: drinking. “My alcohol tolerance is not very high,” he says. “But I tend to be a fuzzy bear when I drink. I go happy fuzzy.”

He pours two glasses of whiskey for us, and the three of us adjourn to his living room, where there’s a mechanical Edison phonograph, an Enigma machine and a short-wave radio from World War I on display.

During the interview, Riley lounges on the couch nearby, half paying attention to the conversation, half paying attention to her phone.

Musk is in a different mood than he was at SpaceX, and that’s something that those who’ve come to know Musk observe. One moment, he may be reciting favorite lines from an animated TV show he just saw, the next he may be curtly giving detailed instructions, the next he may be ignoring you while lost in a thought, the next he may be asking for your advice on a problem, the next he may be breathless with laughter while riffing on a humorous tangent for five minutes, the next he may be acting as if you’ve both never met. And through it all, you learn not to take it personally, because chances are that it has nothing to do with you.

We start off talking, or at least with me trying to talk, about AI, because a few weeks earlier, Musk had tweeted, “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.”

But when I ask him about that, Musk gets testy. “I don’t have all the answers. I’m not saying that I have all the fucking answers. Let me be really clear about that. I’m trying to figure out the set of actions I can take that are more likely to result in a good future. If you have suggestions in that regard, please tell me what they are.”

Riley chimes in: “I think just the way it gets couched is that ‘Elon Musk says we’re all gonna die,’ as opposed to ‘Hey, let’s have some regulation.'”

Musk, it soon becomes clear, is not in the mood to talk about his work. Instead, he has some advice he’d like to offer to the world from his personal experience: “I find one learns lessons in the course of life,” he begins with a wry half-smile. “And one lesson I’ve learned is, don’t tweet on Ambien. That’s on the record: Tweeting on Ambien is unwise. You may regret it.”

Musk grabs a coffee-table book published by The Onion and starts leafing through it, laughing hysterically. “In order to understand the essential truth of things,” he theorizes, “I think you can find it in The Onion and occasionally on Reddit.”

Afterward, he asks excitedly, “Have you ever seen Rick and Morty?” And the conversation bounces from that animated show to South Park to The Simpsons to the book Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.

One of the lines from Hitchhiker’s, Musk says, ended up being Musk Family Rule Number One: “Don’t panic.”

“The boys were quite skittish about all kinds of things,” Riley explains.

“That’s our other rule,” Musk continues. “Safety third. There’s not even a Rule Number Two. But even though there’s nothing in second place, safety is not getting promoted to number two.”

We’re interrupted by Teller, Musk’s chief of staff, who informs him that as we were talking, the Hawthorne City Council ended an hours-long debate with a 4-to-1 vote allowing Musk to burrow his tunnel two miles into the city.

“Good,” Musk says. “Now we can dig past our own property line. Dig like fiends!”

He laughs at the expression, and I understand now that Musk didn’t have me over to talk about his projects and vision. There’s nothing to be gained from talking about the problems of science with someone who doesn’t understand them. At the end of the day, he just wants to unwind and laugh about the world he’s trying to improve.

I

leave his home still hearing his chuckles in the doorway, and hoping that when

the Mars colony builds its first statues of Musk, they’re not of a stiff man

with a tight-lipped expression looking out into space, but of a fuzzy bear."
https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/15/technology/elon-musk-tesla-racial-discrimination/index.html,pos,1.0,2.840127391720954e-16,An Elon Musk email from May is making people upset,2017-11-15 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:44:54.120440,Jill Disis,"Elon Musk sent an email in May that encouraged Tesla employees to be ""thick-skinned.""

Some have taken Musk's email to mean that his employees should forgive racist abuse from coworkers.

Tesla released Musk's May 31 email in response to a lawsuit filed Monday that alleges racial discrimination and harassment at the company. The email, titled ""Doing the right thing,"" is a lengthy directive from Musk about how Tesla workers should treat each other.

""In fairness, if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology,"" Musk wrote in part of the email. ""If you are part of a less represented group, you don't get a free pass on being a jerk yourself.""

Though the email is not specific about what it means to be a ""jerk,"" Musk says employees should never ""intentionally allow someone to feel excluded, uncomfortable or unfairly treated."" He also notes that, ""Part of not being a huge jerk is considering how someone might feel who is part of an historically less represented group.""

Musk added that Tesla has encountered a few cases in which people from underrepresented groups have been promoted over white colleagues but they nonetheless sued Tesla for discrimination, which Musk called ""obviously not cool.""

Portions of the email appeared Monday in a civil lawsuit that alleges racial discrimination and harassment at the company. A day later, Tesla posted the entire email on its website as part of a statement refuting the lawsuit's claims.

The lawsuit was filed by Marcus Vaughn, who is black, and who worked at a Tesla production factory in California.

Vaughn claimed that coworkers and supervisors regularly called him the n-word, and that the company -- including Musk -- was notified and did nothing to stop it. He also claimed he was fired last month for ""not having a positive attitude.""

The excerpted email appears several pages into the complaint, where it is cited as an example of how Vaughn claimed Tesla allowed racial harassment to happen.

""In light of CEO Musk's message to employees that racist epithets can be directed 'unintentionally' and that it is 'important to be thick-skinned,' it is not surprising that the Tesla factory has become a hotbed for racist behavior,"" the lawsuit said.

Tesla swiftly denied both the merits of the complaint and that characterization of Musk's email.

In a blog post Tuesday, the company called the document a ""hotbed of misinformation"" and said Vaughn was a temporary worker who left after his contract ended. He contacted Musk while he worked there but did not mention racial discrimination, Tesla said.

The company added that it investigated ""conflicting accusations and counter-accusations"" between black and Hispanic people who worked on or near Vaughn's team, and ultimately fired three people.

Vaughn's attorney had no immediate comment. A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request.

Tesla said Musk's email was intended to let workers know that ""no one should feel excluded, uncomfortable, or unfairly treated.""

The blog post drew ire from Richard Lawler, a senior news editor at Engadget.

""Assigning people the responsibility of being 'thick-skinned' is labor they did not ask for,"" Lawler tweeted at Musk.

Musk shot back: ""Do you really believe that someone's life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?""

Do you really believe that someone's life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 15, 2017

Later Wednesday, Lawler tweeted that he is ""deeply interested in these stories of people who have had their lives ruined exclusively because a coworker didn't accept their apology for the only offensive comment they ever made.""

I'm deeply interested in these stories of people who have had their lives ruined exclusively because a coworker didn't accept their apology for the only offensive comment they ever made. — Richard Lawler (@rjcc) November 15, 2017

""He should recognize that encouraging an employee on a temporary contract to be 'thick-skinned' puts them in a nearly untenable position,"" Lawler told CNNMoney. ""A good policy would investigate the limitless other options available for dealing with harassment or offensive behavior in the workplace.""

The Vaughn case, and the ensuing controversy, is not the first time Tesla has been accused of being hostile toward black workers.

Four lawsuits have been filed in recent months that describe a toxic culture at the plant in Fremont, California, where Tesla makes its electric cars and where about 10,000 people work. Three employees claimed that the environment was so bad as to be ""straight from the Jim Crow era.""

The company at the time told CNN Tech that while it takes all complaints seriously, ""in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company. Not one.""

One of the main keys to his success is his emotional intelligence, as he displays with his family, employees and even upset Tesla customers.

But amid Tesla's launch of the Model 3 vehicle in July, the company's chief executive officer revealed he was going through a breakup. In an interview for Rolling Stone's latest cover story with reporter and bestselling author Neil Strauss, Musk admitted, ""If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy.""

Musk, 46, had been publicly dating Australian actress Amber Heard for about a year when the pair amicably broke up.

""It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around,"" Musk said. ""For most of that day, I was morbid. And then I had to psych myself up: drink a couple of Red Bulls, hang out with positive people and then, like, tell myself: 'I have all these people depending on me. All right, do it!'""

""I was really in love, and it hurt bad,"" Musk said, adding, ""Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think.""

Leading up to the new Tesla launch, he said he had been in ""severe emotional pain"" for several weeks.

Strauss added that leading up to the event, Musk meditated ""for pretty much the first time in his life to get centered.""

Musk has been married twice before: first to writer Justine Musk for eight years, who is the mother of their five children, and later to actress Talulah Riley, which was on and off for roughly four years.

In 2012, between a divorce and his re-marriage to Riley, Musk told Bloomberg BusinessWeek about his balance between his work life and love life.

""I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,"" Musk told Bloomberg BusinessWeek reporter Ashlee Vance. ""I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. How much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours?""

Given that Musk splits his time between four companies, reportedly works between 80 to 90 hours a week, gets about six hours of sleep a night and even works while relaxing, Musk doesn't seem to get much time to himself.

When Musk and Heard ended their relationship last summer, Musk attributed the breakup to this very time constraint over social media.

""Long distance relationships when both partners have intense work obligations are always difficult, but who knows what the future holds,"" Musk commented on one of Heard's Instagram photos.

Musk told Strauss that from the time he was a child, he has never liked being alone. And he's onto something: The world's longest study on adult life and happiness has found that good relationships keep us happier and healthier for longer. Even business magnate Warren Buffett argues that ""its much more fun achieving things in life with a partner.""

There's even scientific research to back up Buffett's advice. A study published by Carnegie Mellon University found that people with supportive spouses are ""more likely to give themselves the chance to succeed.""

As for Musk's future companion?

""I'm looking for a long-term relationship. I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I'm looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing,"" he said.

The profile contains dozens of adverbs and an extensive psychoanalysis of Musk based on his posture, breathing patterns, and a “ring of red” that spontaneously appears around his eyes in the middle of a sentence. It gives Musk a handful of nicknames including “a titan, a visionary, a human-size lever pushing forward massive historical inevitabilities,” and “the kind of person who comes around only a few times in a century.” Most importantly, it dedicates at least 1,000 words to Musk’s romantic life and his recent break-up with actress Amber Heard — a subject that he broaches himself.

Here are some highlights, but I recommend reading the whole thing:

Then he heaves a sigh and ends his effort at composure. ""I just broke up with my girlfriend,"" he says hesitantly. ""I was really in love, and it hurt bad."" He pauses and corrects himself: ""Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think.""

Strauss, for his part, seems to completely forget that he is interviewing “a titan, a visionary, a human-size lever,” and starts offering him relationship advice.

Musk discusses the breakup for a few more minutes, then asks, earnestly, deadpan, ""Is there anybody you think I should date? It's so hard for me to even meet people."" He swallows and clarifies, stammering softly, ""I'm looking for a long-term relationship. I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I'm looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing."" I eventually tell him that it may not be a good idea to jump right into another relationship. He may want to take some time to himself and figure out why his previous relationships haven't worked in the long run: his marriage to writer Justine Musk, his marriage to actress Talulah Riley, and this new breakup with actress Amber Heard.

Strauss seems worried about Musk’s loneliness, but does not seem worried that he is getting a little offtrack in his profile of a billionaire who wants to send human beings to Mars.

Musk shakes his head and grimaces: ""If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy."" I explain that needing someone so badly that you feel like nothing without them is textbook codependence.

During this portion of the profile, when a different journalist (maybe? who can say!) might have considered pointing out how strange the interaction was, Strauss described Musk’s demeanor like this: “stiff, yet in the sheen of his eyes and the trembling of his lips, a high tide of emotion is visible, pushing against the retaining walls.”

The profile ends with Strauss imagining the statue of Musk that will be on Mars someday, which he hopes will not be actually of Musk in a literal sense, but of a “fuzzy bear” — Musk in a metaphorical sense."

Neil Strauss has a great big chewy profile of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk at Rolling Stone. It's full of all the stuff that has traditionally made Rolling Stone profiles of actors and rock stars worth the price of admission, including Musk weeping, drinking whiskey, and asking Strauss, author of a book about the subculture of pickup artists, for dating tips.

But it also contains thoughts on beauty — particularly Musk's belief that the things Tesla makes have to look good.

""[I]f you're going to make a product, make it beautiful,"" Musk told Strauss, while checking out the big-rig semi-truck that Tesla will reveal this Thursday in Los Angeles. ""Even if it doesn't affect sales, I want it to be beautiful.""

No one has ever really tried to make a big-rig beautiful. Massive, yet. Slightly scary, sure. Imposing, definitely.

So Tesla will be — yet again — trying something new with the big-rig.

However, the embrace of beauty is nothing new for the company or Musk. Tesla's vehicle are all pretty stunning, which is an impressive feat given that Tesla isn't currently selling exotic supercars. Rather, its lineup consists of a luxury sedan and SUV and a mid-market four-door.

With the Model 3 especially, Tesla has a car that doesn't need to be beautiful but still is. So much so that once it starts to show up on the road in greater numbers, I think everyone is going to want it.

There's really only one other company that's as obsessed with aesthetics as Tesla. Yep, Apple. Steve Jobs' embrace of making things look cool has certainly paid off. Musk and Tesla are following that lead."

To say that billionaire tech-preneur Elon Musk is a busy man would be an understatement. Musk finds himself at the helm of a number of companies, each of which have goals firmly set on the future.

To bring electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) and renewable energy solutions forward, he has Tesla. To give humankind a chance at becoming a multi-planetary species, there’s SpaceX. To transform transportation — and build better tunnels — he’s working with the Boring Company. To have a hand at the conscientious development of artificial intelligence (AI), he’s involved with OpenAI. And, lastly, to augment the human brain’s capabilities, he’s put up Neuralink.

It’s easy to get lost with so many multifarious goals that Musk has across this smorgasbord of companies, so let’s put these down in a list; Here’s what Musk plans to achieve by 2030:

A Timeline of Projects

2017: Quite a number of the goals Musk set for his many endeavors look at the really near future, as close as 100 days in fact when it comes to building the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Australia. Musk said back in March that he’s planning to complete the battery in just a hundred days, or else it’ll be free.

The countdown officially started in September, which puts 100 days in a little over three months. However, by the end of September, construction was already half done. Meanwhile, Musk has promised to begin deliveries of Tesla’s improved SolarRoofs by the end of 2017.



2018: What’s possibly on top of Musk’s priorities is getting the Model 3 production on track. The goal now is to hit 5,000 cars per month by March 2018. With some set-backs in production, it’s difficult to say if Tesla would actually reach its goal. Around the same time, Tesla has promised updates to their Autopilot self-driving car software, which would purportedly bring their autonomous vehicles a step closer to reaching Level-5 autonomy before 2020. Back in Australia, a solar and wind farm project where Tesla would be providing Powerpacks is expected to be finished by 2018.

2019: Exciting things lie ahead this year. The recently unveiled Tesla electric semi, though scarce on details, is slated to begin production by 2019. Around this time, between October 2018 to April 2019, Tesla will also unveil an electric pickup truck. Also in the same year, a long-been-hinted-at compact SUV called the Model Y would supposedly be launched, as well as a Tesla flying car dubbed the Model F. Editor’s note: The Model F was just an April Fools joke.

Then there’s the Boring Company’s tunnel under Los Angeles. Although Musk hasn’t exactly revealed a concrete timetable for it, we can assume that — with the rate of work being done and approvals from local authorities having been given — this advanced tunnel transportation system could be completed and could become operational within the next couple of years.

2020: Some three years down the road, Musk’s plans get even bigger. For starters, the Tesla Roadster 2.0, which has been unveiled as a surprise this November, is set for a 2020 release. Then, if all went well with the Model 3 production, Tesla should be producing one million of these EVs per year by 2020.

Also by this year, Tesla’s EVs would supposedly have reached a range of 1,000 kilometers on a single charge. Add to this are plans for a Tesla fleet mobility service.

2021: Musk might narrowly complete a Tesla gigafactory in China around 2020, which would begin EV production by 2021. The plans to build a manufacturing plant in China goes hand-in-hand with the country’s efforts to have more EVs on the roads by 2030. Together with a gigafactory, Tesla also plans to put up 1,000 superchargers in China.

2022: Perhaps the biggest moment for Musk would come in 2022, with the first planned cargo mission to Mars aboard the revamped BFR. The new reusable rocket would become the standard for SpaceX missions, in an effort to bring down the costs of space travel.

2024: Two years later, Elon Musk plans to send the first crewed mission to the red planet. At some point between 2022 and 2024, SpaceX might also launch a new kind of city-to-city transport aboard an earth-to-earth version of the BFR.

2030 and Beyond

Elon Musk also has a number of other projects that don’t yet have a definite timetable, or at least none have been made public. On top of these is the Hyperloop, which Musk decided would be something either Tesla or SpaceX would be more involved with. Another project that’s currently in its earliest stages of development is the Neuralink, Musk’s attempts to merge the human brain with AI.

So, Musk has a lot on his plate. We could expect a few stumbles along the way, but for someone who is quite familiar with criticism, cynicism, and skepticism like Musk on the helm, we’ll probably be pleasantly surprised by the multitude of plans he completes by deadline."

On June 6 at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO took a moment to explain how he spends his week.

Musk’s schedule has been the subject of fascination for years. How, precisely, does one person run so many enterprises while planning to retire on Mars and extolling the virtues of the video game Overwatch on Twitter? Quartz reviewed years of interviews and articles, as well as his most recent comments, to estimate the CEO’s weekly schedule.

Work, work, work. But just enough sleep

Unsurprisingly, the head of Tesla and SpaceX spends most of his time running companies. Musk has reportedly scaled back his workweek from a grueling 100 hours after launching his companies to a more tolerable “80 to 90 hours per week.” To sustain the pace, caffeine has been his co-pilot. At its peak, Inc. reports, Musk’s habit consisted of eight cans of Diet Coke and several large cups of coffee daily. “I got so freaking jacked that I seriously started to feel like I was losing my peripheral vision,” he says. Musk claims he has cut back: “Now, the office has caffeine-free Diet Coke.”

Sleep, however, proved essential. Musk found cutting back on sleep diminished how much he could accomplish during the day. Rather than skimp, Musk settled into a schedule rising around 7AM and going to bed after 1AM. “The right number for me is around 6 to 6.5 hours per night,” he said in a 2013 interview at Mountain View’s Computer History Museum and confirmed in a more recent reddit AMA . “Sleep is really great. I find if I don’t get enough sleep I’m quite grumpy…I could drop below a certain threshold of sleep, although I would be awake more hours I would get less done because my mental acuity would be affected.” That period is within the “appropriate” range, according to the National Sleep Foundation.

So how does all this compare to the average American? For one thing, it’s about twice as many working hours. The average employed 25- to 54-year-old in the US works 6.3 hours per day (or 8.8 hours excluding weekends), according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Musk, ostensibly, logs about 12 hours per day, every day. His sleep and “off-time” (he warns he multi-tasks email, even when spending time with his children) are about 20% and 40% off the average, respectively.

On the clock at five companies

Musk said on June 6 he splits the bulk of his work hours (at least 90%) between his two biggest companies, Tesla and SpaceX. Three other initiatives, where he juggles roles as a co-founder, investor or executive, consume the rest of his time. In 2013, Musk described a harried schedule of working at SpaceX in Los Angeles on Monday, then flying to the Bay Area on Tuesday night to start work at Tesla on Wednesday and Thursday before returning to SpaceX on Friday and the weekend (or splitting some time at Tesla). On June 6, he he now spends slightly more time at Tesla, a “drama magnet,” relative to SpaceX.

1 So how do I allocate my time across my companies?



Yes, so I think it’s very important to appreciate that tweet frequency does not – there is no correlation with what I actually do for work basis. It’s like I might tweet a lot of like boring company which is basically a hobby. So I would when you pull out a real company at this point, it’s like three people, some interns and some part-time people. So we are making a pretty good progress for all of that. But that’s just kind of like a fun thing to do.



Where there is like no pressure, everything is going to fail, so it’s like okay, look I want to go up from there. So that’s like low expectations are great. But the boring company is maybe 2% of my time, Neuralink is 3% to 5% of my time, OpenAI is going to be a couple of percent and then 90% plus is divided between SpaceX and Tesla. So depending upon – and it’s probably slightly more Tesla, Tesla is more like a drama magnet, so it’s like so have to do with Tesla drama.



So but on average, it’s probably about half of my time is between SpaceX and Tesla and there is a lot to be gained knowing how rockets are done, and how cars are done. And rockets you had to do work on the very best mass materials, make things super-light and being able to translate some of that to automotive, I think it’s been very helpful.



So it does do some good there, but I just want to reemphasize very clearly 90% plus of my time is divided between SpaceX and Tesla and this remaining less than 10% is everything else.

Family time

It’s not clear how much time Musk spends at home, but his five sons reportedly spend about four days per week with their father according to interviews in Ashlee Vance’s book on Elon Musk. The boys regularly visit Musk’s California factories, as well as go on an annual camping trip. “I’m a pretty good dad,” Musk said. “I have the kids for slightly more than half the week and spend a fair bit of time with them. I also take them with me when I go out of town.”

2 According to Riley, Elon is kind of cheeky and funny. He is very loving. He is devoted to his children. He tries to come home early for family dinners with me and the kids and maybe play some computer games with the boys.



They will tell us about their day, and we’ll put them to bed. Then we’ll chat and watch something together on the laptop like The Colbert Report. On the weekends, we’re traveling. The kids are good travelers. There were billions of nannies before. There was even a nanny manager. Things are a bit more normal now. We try and do stuff just as a family when we can.



We have the kids four days a week. I like to say that I am the disciplinarian. I want them to have the sense of an ordinary life, but they live a very odd life. They were just on a trip with Justin Bieber. They go to the rocket factory and are like, ‘Oh no, not again.’ It’s not cool if your dad does it. They’re used to it.



- Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance

He’s had less flattering coverage about the time he devotes to his romantic interests. After his first divorce with Justine Musk in 2008, and splitting with his second wife actress Talulah Riley (for the first time), he mentioned a “10-hour dating” plan.

“I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,” Musk said according to Vance’s book. “I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to ten—how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.” He and Riley reconciled and remarried in 2013, but the pair is parting amicably for the second time. Musk is now spending time, possibly more than 10 hours per week, with actress Amber Heard.

All work, and some play

Musk, who once spent does have a few leisure pursuits. Video games are a common theme in his Twitter feed. Musk also rattled off his hobbies on June 6. “I listen to music in the car,” he said, before stopping to recall other diversions. “I do watch movies, although less these days,” he said. “Hang out with kids, see friends, normal stuff. Sometimes go crazy on Twitter. But usually it’s work more.”

3 It was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day,” said [Musk's cousin] Kimbal. “If it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a day.” The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they realized mid-trip that Elon had gone missing.

Musk showed a demonstration of the idea onstage, claiming that it will allow passengers to take “most long-distance trips” in just 30 minutes, and go “anywhere on Earth in under an hour” for around the same price as an economy airline ticket.

Musk proposed using SpaceX’s forthcoming mega-rocket (codenamed Big Fucking Rocket or BFR for short) to lift a massive spaceship into orbit around the Earth. The ship would then settle down on floating landing pads near major cities. Both the new rocket and spaceship are currently theoretical, though Musk did say that he hopes to begin construction on the rocket in the next six to nine months.

In SpaceX’s video that illustrates the idea, passengers take a large boat from a dock in New York City to a floating launchpad out in the water. There, they board the same rocket that Musk wants to use to send humans to Mars by 2024. But instead of heading off to another planet once they leave the Earth’s atmosphere, the ship separates and breaks off toward another city — Shanghai.

Just 39 minutes and some 7,000 miles later, the ship reenters the atmosphere and touches down on another floating pad, much like the way SpaceX lands its Falcon 9 rockets at sea. Other routes proposed in the video include Hong Kong to Singapore in 22 minutes, London to Dubai or New York in 29 minutes, and Los Angeles to Toronto in 24 minutes.

Hong Kong to Singapore in 22 minutes, London to Dubai or New York in 29 minutes, and more

This proposed method of Earth-city-to-Earth-city travel would be, by far, the fastest ever created by humanity. The ship would reach a speed of about 18,000 miles per hour at its peak, Musk said, which is more than an order of magnitude faster than the Concorde.

Musk presented the idea at the very end of his speech, so he was light on details when it comes to the other logistics surrounding this proposal. (In fact, most of Musk’s speech was about how he wants to use this new rocket system to make all current and forthcoming Falcon rockets obsolete.) Using the numbers he showed earlier in the talk when describing the ship’s capacity with regards to the Moon and Mars, we can estimate it could carry somewhere between 80 and 200 people per trip. But we don’t know other basics like how much of the air travel market Musk sees this occupying, how it would be regulated, or even when SpaceX might attempt such a feat.

We also don’t know what the passenger experience would be like, and that’s an important factor in an idea like this. The thought of blasting off on a rocket to space is exciting, as is the potential for adding moments of weightlessness to your trip to London or wherever. But will people actually be willing to put their bodies through these kinds of extreme stresses for the sake of shaving a few hours off their trip?

And then there’s the landing. Despite occasional hiccups, airplanes land with overwhelming success. To its credit, SpaceX has gotten really good at landing its Falcon 9 rockets both on land and at sea, and Musk even began his speech by touting how 16 of them have landed successfully in a row. But the difference between landing a 14-story rocket booster with no passengers and a large ship full of them is one Musk will hopefully expound upon, either during another presentation or the next time he opens Twitter."

""We started off with just a few people who really didn't know how to make rockets,"" the CEO of SpaceX says. The Hawthorne, Calif.-based aeronautics company was founded in 2002 to ""revolutionize space technology"" and enable multiplanitary human existance.

""And the reason I ended up being the chief engineer or chief designer was not because I wanted to, it was because I couldn't hire anyone. Nobody good would join. So I ended up being that by default. """

Musk's company, SpaceX, is developing a huge spacecraft to colonize Mars. It could also be used much closer to home.

Speaking at a space conference in Australia on Friday, Musk said the company had looked into applying the technology to whizzing people to different places on Earth in insanely fast times.

""The results are quite interesting,"" he said as a video showed a simulation of people boarding a rocket in New York that blasted off into space and then came back down to land in Shanghai.

""The great thing about going to space is there's no friction, so once you're out of the atmosphere ... it'll be smooth as silk, there's no weather,"" Musk said.

Most journeys between points on this planet will take less than 30 minutes, he predicted, and none should take longer than an hour.

In an Instagram post after the presentation, Musk said the cost per seat ""should be about the same as full fare economy in an aircraft.""

Musk teased the idea at the end of a presentation about SpaceX's plans to land cargo ships on Mars in 2022. Spaceships carrying people should follow by 2024.

The company is developing a giant reusable rocketship for those missions -- called BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket. Inside the company, it's nicknamed the ""Big F--king Rocket."" It plans to start building the first one by the middle of next year.

That's the same rocket that Musk says could be used to zoom people from city to city on Earth, traveling as fast as 27,000 kilometers per hour (17,000 mph).

Unlike the Mars missions, Musk didn't offer any indication of when these super-fast journeys could become a reality.

He's not the only billionaire aiming to speed up travel.

Richard Branson has said he wants to perfect a ""rocket plane"" to transport people between cities on Earth via space. Branson, who's pursuing his space ambitions through Virgin Galactic, has forecast that the trip from New York to Sydney could one day take 30 minutes.

Musk also has plans to build an underground ""hyperloop"" network that can shuttle commuters between New York and Washington, which are about 230 miles apart, in 29 minutes.

Speaking at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, South Australia, Musk unveiled plans to launch SpaceX’s (spacex) BFR rocket and begin its Mars rendezvous by the year 2022, first sending two cargo missions to scout water sources and build a fuel plant. Then the city-building begins.

Musk said he’s “confident” the plan will be under way within five years.

“I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars,” Musk said, adding that he thinks SpaceX has figured out a way to make it affordable by using revenues from the company’s satellite launches, service missions to the International Space Station and by making smaller, more efficient rockets that are mostly reusable.

Nine years after SpaceX’s first successful launch — its fourth ever — Musk said his engineers are now perfecting propulsive landing. He believes the BFR rocket can carry out missions to the moon and back without producing propellant, enabling the establishment of a lunar space station.

“It’s 2017, we should have a lunar base by now,” Musk said to applause. “What the hell is going on?”

For more on space travel, watch Fortune’s video:

Travel to and from Mars will, however, require a propellant production plant. Current rocket prototypes provide cabin space suitable for about 100 people per mission, he said. Following the two projected missions in 2022, Musk said SpaceX plans to send four more rockets to the red planet during the next available window in 2024. Once colonization is under way, then begins the task of “making it a nice place to be.”

Founded by Musk in 2002, SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches spacecraft and advanced rockets toward the ultimate goal of enabling human life on other planets.

But Musk, who also co-founded and serves as CEO of Tesla Motors (tsla), remains grounded in his ambitions. SpaceX could potentially change the way we travel around the globe, he said, making it possible to get anywhere on earth in less than hour. “If we’re building this thing to go to mars,” Musk asked, “why not go to other places on earth as well?”"

And now, maybe, uniter of the seven continents, if his plan for rocket travel takes off.

Musk, the man who would take humans between planets like the Dothraki crossing the Narrow Sea, has added another dash of wildfire to his plans for saving the world. During a presentation at the the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia, on Friday, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO announced his plan to use a fleet of reusable rockets to move people between any two cities on Earth in under an hour.

OK, “plan” is a stretch. Musk didn’t go into any of the details, like when he might do this, or where, or how. A short video he played on stage (gotta hope he has got his renderings guy on retainer) showed passengers boarding a ship and sailing out to a floating launch pad. They stroll into a rocket, which blasts off, hits nearly 17,000 mph in suborbital space, reenters the atmosphere, and touches down again. Then it’s back onto a boat and into the destination city. London to Dubai in 29 minutes. New York to Paris in 30. Delhi to San Francisco in 40. The world has never felt so small, so connected.

“It’s a great, fantastic thought,” says John Olds, a former aerospace engineering professor who founded and now runs Spaceworks, a company that develops hypersonic flight and space exploration technology. Olds also helped form and previously ran the FastForward Project, an industry group focused on point-to-point space travel.

The idea of traveling through space or at very high altitudes has been around for decades. At least half a dozen companies, including Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, are pursuing it. But nearly all of them plan on using planes capable of flying to extreme altitudes and at supersonic speeds, not ground-based rockets.

“A rocket-powered ballistic point-to-point is fast, I’ll give you that,” Olds says. “But it’s expensive and complicated and, I would say, unlikely to be the final solution by which we travel around the planet.”

Let’s say Musk nails down all the rocket tech and ensures the things can take off and land safely 100 percent of the time, or acceptably close to it. Let’s say he figures out how to keep them full of fuel, and puts enough people in electric cars that he’s not destroying the atmosphere.

Then he gets to tackle the real problems. Like how to get passengers through the crushing g-forces that come with takeoff and landing. The weightless period in the middle may be cool, but it’s not exactly a work environment business travelers will enjoy. Running anything more than the occasional flight would require an unprecedented integration with the national airspace system, to keep the rockets from taking out planes the way planes take out birds. “From a regulatory point of view it’s very difficult,” Olds says.

Building launch pads at sea assuages concerns about annoying city dwellers with the noise, sonic booms, and vibrations that come with hurling rockets into the sky, but brings up another concern. The flight itself may be brief, but forcing customers to get to the ocean in the first place could easily add hours to trip time. And it’s hard to see rockets serving any major city that’s not near an ocean or lake, like Paris, Berlin, New Delhi, Denver, Riyadh, or Johannesburg.

“I would like to see this development mesh with existing infrastructure,” like airports, says Madhu Thangavelu, who studies space exploration at the University of Southern California. “Then it becomes much easier to put safety protocols in place.” Otherwise, Thangavelu is jazzed about the idea, and Musk’s role in pushing the limits of what people may think is possible. “The moment you master it, you’ll have a lineup of customers,” he says. “I can’t wait to see this happen.”

It would be a wonderful thing, no doubt. Same goes for the high-speed hyperloop, electric cars for everyone, life on Mars, a base on the moon, or a network of traffic-annihilating tunnels. But if Musk really wants to add another honorific to his list of titles, rockets may not be the best move.

“I think there are better ways to do it,” Olds says. “Basically really fast airplanes.”"

There are two schools of thought about how information should flow within companies. By far the most common way is chain of command, which means that you always flow communication through your manager. The problem with this approach is that, while it serves to enhance the power of the manager, it fails to serve the company.

Instead of a problem getting solved quickly, where a person in one dept talks to a person in another dept and makes the right thing happen, people are forced to talk to their manager who talks to their manager who talks to the manager in the other dept who talks to someone on his team. Then the info has to flow back the other way again. This is incredibly dumb. Any manager who allows this to happen, let alone encourages it, will soon find themselves working at another company. No kidding.

Anyone at Tesla can and should email/talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest way to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company. You can talk to your manager's manager without his permission, you can talk directly to a VP in another dept, you can talk to me, you can talk to anyone without anyone else's permission. Moreover, you should consider yourself obligated to do so until the right thing happens. The point here is not random chitchat, but rather ensuring that we execute ultra-fast and well. We obviously cannot compete with the big car companies in size, so we must do so with intelligence and agility.

One final point is that managers should work hard to ensure that they are not creating silos within the company that create an us vs. them mentality or impede communication in any way. This is unfortunately a natural tendency and needs to be actively fought. How can it possibly help Tesla for depts to erect barriers between themselves or see their success as relative within the company instead of collective? We are all in the same boat. Always view yourself as working for the good of the company and never your dept.

August 30, 2017 3 min read

It makes sense that Elon Musk, whose businesses are based on throwing out existing industry rulebooks and going his own way, doesn’t have much use for a customary office hierarchy.

In an email sent to the Tesla staff obtained by Inc., Musk explains how a communication pattern that funnels power to just one leader can be harmful to innovation.

“There are two schools of thought about how information should flow within companies. By far the most common way is chain of command, which means that you always flow communication through your manager,” Musk writes. “The problem with this approach is that, while it serves to enhance the power of the manager, it fails to serve the company.”

He explains that if a problem arises, the chain of command method requires the person who recognizes it to elevate it to their manager, who then speaks to another manager on their level in another department, who then addresses it with the person who handles that issue on their team. That process, he explains, is inherently flawed. “This is incredibly dumb. Any manager who allows this to happen, let alone encourages it, will soon find themselves working at another company,” Musk warns. “No kidding.”

So, what is the solution? Don’t create artificial barriers between your company’s departments. Just do what you can to solve the problem in the most expedient way possible. And that could even mean going right to the top.

“You can talk to me, you can talk to anyone without anyone else's permission,” Musk explains. “Moreover, you should consider yourself obligated to do so until the right thing happens. The point here is not to encourage random chitchat, but rather ensuring that we execute ultra-fast and well. We obviously cannot compete with the big car companies in size, so we must do so with intelligence and agility.”

He says he believes that the growth of the business, not the inner workings of your department relative to to others within the company, should be every employee’s main concern. “Managers should work hard to ensure that they are not creating silos within the company that create an us vs. them mentality or impede communication in any way. This is unfortunately a natural tendency and needs to be actively fought,” cautions Musk. “We are all in the same boat. Always view yourself as working for the good of the company and never your dept.”

AP Photo/Jack Plunkett Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is no stranger to tackling challenges — his companies work on everything from space suits to self-driving cars to miles of tunnels under Los Angeles.

They also work on communication.

In an email from Musk to Tesla employees published by Inc's Justin Bariso, Musk encourages employees to buck the traditional chain of command found in most companies, in which messages always flow through managers.

""The problem with this approach is that, while it serves to enhance the power of the manager, it fails to serve the company,"" he wrote.

He continued:

""Instead of a problem getting solved quickly, where a person in one dept talks to a person in another dept and makes the right thing happen, people are forced to talk to their manager who talks to their manager who talks to the manager in the other dept who talks to someone on his team. Then the info has to flow back the other way again. This is incredibly dumb. Any manager who allows this to happen, let alone encourages it, will soon find themselves working at another company. No kidding.""

A better way, Musk wrote, is to speak to whomever you need, whenever you need, however it best serves the company.

""Anyone at Tesla can and should email/talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest way to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company,"" he wrote. ""You can talk to your manager's manager without his permission, you can talk directly to a VP in another dept, you can talk to me, you can talk to anyone without anyone else's permission.""

In fact, he wrote, in the spirit of ""ensuring that we execute ultra-fast and well,"" employees should consider themselves ""obligated to do so until the right thing happens.""

Bariso reports the email was sent to employees ""a few years ago"" and that Tesla confirmed its authenticity.

When your company is at the forefront of technology and space exploration, communication might seem like an afterthought. But, as Musk apparently recognized, poor communication can set everyone back. How are you supposed to accomplish anything if you're misspeaking or your colleagues don't respect you?

If diverging from the traditional chain of command doesn't work on clearing up communication, perhaps we should wait for Musk's next project — he raised $27 million with the aim of linking human brains with computers."

As the guiding force behind Tesla, SpaceX, and OpenAI (among a host of other companies), he's confronting some of the world's biggest challenges head-on.

I recently stumbled across this interview with Musk, and his advice resonated with me. His lessons are aimed at entrepreneurs, but the final point can be applied by anyone.

Here are the highlights:

1. Get ready for a whole lot of hurt.

""Starting a business is not for everyone,"" begins Musk. ""Starting a business, I'd say, number one is have a high pain threshold.""

Musk goes on to share one of his favorite sayings, which he learned from a friend:

""Starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss.""

""That's generally what happens,"" explains Musk. ""Because, when you first start a company, there's lots of optimism. And things are great. Happiness at first is high. And then you encounter all sorts of issues--and happiness will steadily decline. Then, you'll go through a whole world of hurt. And, eventually, if you succeed--and in most cases you will not succeed ... And Tesla almost didn't succeed. It came very close to failure. If you succeed, then after a long time, you will finally get back to happiness.""

This is so true. When I started working for myself several years ago, I wasn't prepared for the amount of pain I'd have to endure. And I've failed more often than I've succeeded.

But every failure was a lesson learned--and the successes wouldn't have been possible without them.

2. Don't waste time on minor improvements.

If you're building a product or offering a service, says Musk, it can't be just a little better than the competition--it has to be great.

""If you're entering anything where there's an existing marketplace, against large, entrenched competitors, then your product or service needs to be much better than theirs,"" he says. ""It can't be a little bit better, because then you put yourself in the shoes of the consumer ... you're always going to buy the trusted brand unless there's a big difference.""

This reminds me of the vital lesson Guy Kawasaki learned from Steve Jobs many years ago.

""You have to jump curves, not [create] better sameness,"" Kawasaki said in a keynote. ""You don't do things 10 percent better; you do things 10 times better."" Think of how the iPod replaced the Walkman. Or how the iPhone replaced Blackberry. Or how the iPad replaced ... the Palm Pilot?

As Musk says: ""It can't just be slightly better. It's got to be a lot better.""

3. Constantly seek criticism.

This is my favorite lesson from this interview, because it's a vital reminder for everyone.

""A well-thought-out critique of whatever you're doing is as valuable as gold,"" says Musk. The famous founder then encourages listeners to seek criticism from everyone, but ""particularly your friends.""

""Usually your friends know what's wrong,"" explains Musk. ""But they don't want to tell you because they don't want to hurt you. It doesn't mean your friends are right. But very often, they are right.""

This is so true. When it comes to your ideas, those who are closest to you typically want to encourage. The last thing they want is to bring you down.

But these people are also a valuable resource: They can tell you, in-depth, where your weaknesses are and what you need to improve.

Of course, it hurts to hear that you're wrong. That something about you or what you created isn't perfect. But with a little emotional intelligence, you can see that feedback for what it is--an opportunity to get better.

As Musk brilliantly sums it up:"

As for Space X, that's ""about helping to make life multi-planetary,"" he says. According to Musk, we will have no other alternative but to eventually live and work on the red planet because, ""There will be some eventual extinction event,"" on Earth, says Musk in academic journal New Space. To make moving to Mars a reality requires making it more affordable, says Musk. And he believes it is possible. ""It [will get] to the point where almost anyone, if they saved up and this was their goal, could buy a ticket and move to Mars,"" he says.

http://fortune.com/2017/07/15/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-2/,pos,1.0,1.1473834525869803e-16,"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX CEO on Artificial Intelligence Risk",2017-07-15 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:45:20.970262,David Z. Morris,"Appearing before a meeting of the National Governor’s Association on Saturday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk described artificial intelligence as “the greatest risk we face as a civilization” and called for swift and decisive government intervention to oversee the technology’s development.

“On the artificial intelligence front, I have access to the very most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,” an unusually subdued Musk said in a question and answer session with Nevada governor Brian Sandoval.

Musk has long been vocal about the risks of AI. But his statements before the nation’s governors were notable both for their dire severity, and his forceful call for government intervention.

“AI’s a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation, instead of reactive. Because by the time we are reactive with AI regulation, it’s too late,” he remarked. Musk then drew a contrast between AI and traditional targets for regulation, saying “AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization, in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food were not.”

Those are strong words from a man occasionally associated with so-called cyberlibertarianism, a fervently anti-regulation ideology exemplified by the likes of Peter Thiel, who co-founded Paypal with Musk.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Musk went on to argue that broad government regulation was vital because companies are currently pressured to pursue advanced AI or risk irrelevance in the marketplace:

That’s where you need the regulators to come in and say, hey guys, you all need to just pause and make sure this is safe . . . You kind of need the regulators to do that for all the teams in the game. Otherwise the shareholders will be saying, why aren’t you developing AI faster? Because your competitor is.

Part of Musk’s worry stems from social destabilization and job loss. “When I say everything, the robots will do everything, bar nothing,” he said.

But Musk’s bigger concern has to do with AI that lives in the network, and which could be incentivized to harm humans. “[They] could start a war by doing fake news and spoofing email accounts and fake press releases, and just by manipulating information,” he said. “The pen is mightier than the sword.”

Musk outlined a hypothetical situation, for instance, in which an AI could pump up defense industry investments by using hacking and disinformation to trigger a war.

“I’m against overregulation for sure,” Musk emphasized, “But man, I think we’ve got to get on that with AI, pronto.”

Musk’s comments on AI only took up a small part of the hour-long exchange. He also speculated about the future of driverless cars and space travel, and mourned that meeting the sky-high expectations surrounding him was “quite a difficult emotional hardship” and “a whole lot less fun than it may seem.”"

He famously compared work on AI to “summoning the demon,” and has warned time and time again that the technology poses an existential risk to humanity. At a gathering of US governors this weekend, he repeated these sentiments, but also stressed something he says is even more important: that governments need to start regulating AI now.

“I have exposure to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,” Musk told attendees at the National Governors Association summer meeting on Saturday. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal.”

AI represents a “fundamental risk to the existence of civilization”

The solution, says Musk, is regulation: “AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive about regulation instead of reactive. Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it’s too late.” He added that what he sees as the current model of regulation, in which governments step in only after “a whole bunch of bad things happen,” is inadequate for AI because the technology represents “a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.”

As ever, Musk is not talking about the sort of artificial intelligence that companies like Google, Uber, and Microsoft currently use, but what is known as artificial general intelligence — some conscious, super-intelligent entity, like the sort you see in sci-fi movies. Musk (and many AI researchers) believe that work on the former will eventually lead to the latter, but there are plenty of people in the science community who doubt this will ever happen, especially in any of our lifetimes.

What researchers are worried about is how current forms of narrow and “stupid” artificial intelligence can be abused. David Ha, a researcher working with Google Brain, said on Twitter in response to Musk’s comments that he was “more concerned about” machine learning being used to “mask unethical human activities,” than the threat of super-intelligent AI.

François Chollet, the creator of the deep neural net platform Keras, replied that while artificial intelligence “makes a few existing threats worse” it was unclear if it created any new ones. “Arguably the greatest threat is mass population control via message targeting and propaganda bot armies. [Machine learning is] not a requirement though,” said Chollet.

These uses of AI are far less exciting than what Musk is discussing, but unlike the threat from Skynet, they pose real and immediate problems. Algorithms created by machine learning are already being deployed in a number of questionable areas in the US, including helping to sentence criminals. And researchers warn that the Trump administration’s lack of interest in AI (and science generally) is going to mean that many aspects of this emerging field won’t get the scrutiny they deserve.

In this light, Musk’s comments are at least bringing some attention to an under-examined topic. You can watch Musk’s interview in full below, with his remarks on AI starting at around 48 minutes in:"

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, speaking to U.S. governors this weekend, told the political leaders that artificial intelligence poses an ""existential threat"" to human civilization.

At the bipartisan National Governors Association in Rhode Island, Musk also spoke about energy sources, his own electric car company and space travel. But when Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, grinning, asked if robots will take everyone's jobs in the future — Musk wasn't joking when he responded.

Technology Elon Musk: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk' Elon Musk: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk' Listen · 3:51 3:51

Yes, ""robots will do everything better than us,"" Musk said. But he's worried about more than the job market.

""AI is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization, and I don't think people fully appreciate that,"" Musk said. He said he has access to cutting-edge AI technology, and that based on what he's seen, AI is ""the scariest problem.""

Musk told the governors that AI calls for precautionary, proactive government intervention: ""I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it's too late,"" he said.

He was clearly not thrilled to make that argument, calling regulation generally ""not fun"" and ""irksome,"" but he said that in the case of AI, the risks are too high to allow AI to develop unfettered.

""I think people should be really concerned about it,"" Musk said. ""I keep sounding the alarm bell.""

It's true: For years, Musk has issued Cassandra-like cautions about the risks of artificial intelligence. In 2014, he likened AI developers to people summoning demons they think they can control. In 2015, he signed a letter warning of the risk of an AI arms race.

Musk has invested in a project designed to make AI tech open-source, which he asserts will prevent it from being controlled by one company. And earlier this year, Maureen Dowd wrote a lengthy piece for Vanity Fair about Musk's ""crusade to stop the A.I. apocalypse."" Dowd noted that some Silicon Valley leaders — including Google co-founder Larry Page — do not share Musk's skepticism, and describe AI as a possible force for good.

Critics ""argue that Musk is interested less in saving the world than in buffing his brand,"" Dowd writes, and that his speeches on the threat of AI are part of a larger sales strategy.

Back at the governors conference, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development. Musk said the first step would be for the government to gain ""insight"" into the actual status of current research.

""Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid,"" Musk said. ""As they should be."""

But when it comes to artificial intelligence, he's frightened.

At the National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island on Saturday, Musk called AI the ""biggest risk we face as a civilization."" He expressed his concern about machines and software taking control over humans, and called on the government to regulate AI before things escalate.

""I have exposure to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,"" Musk said at the event. ""I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don't know how to react because it seems so ethereal.""

Musk wants the government to be proactive about AI regulation. He believes the current model is reactive, allowing the government to step in only after ""a whole bunch of bad things happen."" He called this setup inadequate because the technology represents ""a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization."""

AP Photo/Jack Plunkett Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he's officially launched his X.com website today.

There's not much to see though. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO ironically referred to the site as ""verbose"", but clicking through shows nothing but the letter 'X'. Musk said that will be ""fixed tomorrow.""

Here's what x.com looks like right now:

Right now, the x.com website only contains the ""x"" letter. x.com

Musk purchased the website back from PayPal just a few days ago. X.com has belonged to PayPal for the last 16 years, and is named after the online payments company that Musk founded in the late 1990s.

To be clear, Musk didn't buy any part of PayPal's business; he just acquired the X.com domain. It's not clear what he plans to do with it.

Musk initially claimed that he had no plans for the site at the moment, and that the purchase mostly had a ""sentimental value"" for him.

Musk has developed a habit of announcing seemingly whimsical new ventures which then turn out to be serious projects. He joked about launching a tunnel digging company after experiencing LA traffic, and then actually did it.

So who knows — X.com could go on to be another major venture, it might relate to SpaceX's activities, or it could be something else entirely."

Musk’s impressive resume is littered with accomplishments, but it’s worth remembering it’s not all sunbeams and soaring stock prices.

Just this week, Tesla blamed “production bottlenecks” for having made only a fraction of the promised 1,500 Model 3s, according to The Wall Street Journal. Major portions of the car were being made by hand rather than on a production line because the automated production line wasn’t ready to use yet -- something highly unusual for automobile production.

Here’s a history of his notable failures and setbacks, as compiled in a massive infographic from Kickresume.

In 2000, Musk almost died after contracting malaria while traveling to Brazil and his homeland South Africa. His take on the incident? “Vacation will kill you.”

First rocket launch.... first explosion:

It seems like most of us would have given up right around here, after Tesla dealt with issues around both crash-related battery fires and even cases around spontaneous combustion.

But he didn’t give up, which leads us to:

Though, a SpaceX spokesperson told MarketWatch that the company doesn’t consider the 2015 explosions as failures, but rather experimental landings, since they provided critical data that has subsequently allowed to land a number of first stages. He also said the “4th, 5th and 6th critical failures” were not failures at all, as they were successful in their intent to deliver their payloads to orbit and that the landings were intended to be experimental.

Some more recent setbacks for Musk have included a surprise downgrade for Tesla from Morgan Stanley, Consumer Reports lowering its ratings on the Mlodel S and Model X, and bad press over allegations that Tesla assembly line employees were working in brutal working conditions. Another study found that the Tesla factory has had higher injury rates than the industry average.

Research shows bosses who demonstrate high emotional intelligence make for better leaders and true team-players.

With 10,000 workers just at Tesla's Fremont, California manufacturing factory alone, Musk has recently had to deal with claims that the facility has led to high injury rates. Although he sent out an email earlier this year sharing his concern about the safety of his workers and ensuring the claims were overstated, Musk sent out a more detailed email reiterating his unease and consideration for Tesla employees."

Please join us at The Ringer as we celebrate and explore the cultural resonance and science of space all week long.

Kate Knibbs: Here are some facts that aren’t up for debate: Elon Musk is one of the most powerful people in the world. As SpaceX CEO and founder, he’s the figurehead of the modern space travel and exploration industry. He’s a man of grand and improbable dreams—of building hyperloops, of romancing movie stars, of colonizing Mars. And he has proved himself capable of realizing at least some of his wildest goals. Elon Musk is a mega-rich innovator who wants to, and probably can, fundamentally change the world.

This is where things get dicey. How will he change the world? Is Musk a hero or a villain? Is he the dashing, inventive James Bond or a dastardly Blofeld with better hair? That’s what we’ll be discussing.

Alyssa Bereznak: I will be arguing that—despite his significant ego and affinity for hype—Musk is Actually Good. He is an optimist within an economy powered by cynics, much more interested in addressing existential threats to the human race than he is profiting from them. Not to mention, his enthusiasm for these issues has inspired a fan base passionate about environmental issues, infrastructure, and space exploration. Musk forces us to talk about stuff that matters!

Knibbs: I admire your optimistic take on who Musk is, even if I disagree. But before we get down to the debate, let’s quickly talk about the criteria we’ll use to determine whether Musk is a hero or villain. Taking someone’s moral temperature is a tricky thing. We’ve got five questions that we’re going to try to answer, right?

Bereznak: That is correct. To prevent this conversation from turning into some rambling Quora thread about Elon Musk’s management style—of which there are many!—we came up with some basic criteria. The best kind of business leaders demonstrate their goodwill both in their capital pursuits and human interactions. So our questions address both personal characteristics and business practices. They are:

Is he nice to employees, family, and strangers? Silicon Valley is famous for giving “brilliant jerks” a pass if it means investors get an iPhone or an Uber out of it. But a CEO’s mistreatment of his employees—or anyone else—should never be glorified. Is Musk nice to people? Is he trying to make the world a better place? Are SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, Neuralink, and the Boring Company actively working toward society’s improvement? Can we rest assured they’re not clubbing baby seals or racking up human rights violations in the process? Does he prioritize moral conscience above business profit? Lots of successful CEOs don’t care who or what they destroy on the way to becoming a famous billionaire. Is Musk one of them? Does he use his personal fortune for good? Bill and Melinda Gates aim to give away 95 percent of their wealth to charity and have aimed to get rid of polio by 2018. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have similar aims with their eponymous initiative. Where does Musk’s philanthropy fall? Finally, is he honest? This one is straightforward, but is something most CEOs struggle with.

Just so we have some cold, hard numbers on the board, let's say that each category can be awarded anywhere between zero and 20 points. We each have control of 10 points in each category and will dole them out as we wish. Behind-the-scenes negotiations are in some cases permitted. Deal?

Knibbs: As far as arbitrary criteria to judge a person’s moral worth, I think this one’s good! So, to jump right into it, I’ll start off with the first question: Is he nice to employees, family, and strangers?

Now, I don’t know how Elon Musk treats strangers, but he may have some work to do in the interpersonal-relationship department. In 2010 his first ex-wife, Justine Musk, wrote one hell of a column for Marie Claire entitled, “‘I Was a Starter Wife’: Inside America’s Messiest Divorce.” Some choice excerpts:

“As we danced at our wedding reception, Elon told me, ‘I am the alpha in this relationship.’”

“‘If you were my employee,’ he said ... ‘I would fire you.’”

I concede that it wasn’t gracious of Justine Musk to air the couple’s private laundry in public. Justine hadn’t written her piece out of the blue; Elon had already written about their divorce for Business Insider.

Elon may have matured since then, though, or, at the very least, neither his second ex-wife, Talulah Riley, nor his ex-girlfriend Amber Heard have penned any scorching takedowns of their relationships. And he does seem to be a loving father to his five sons.

“Musk is very, very skilled at spinning a narrative about his own galactic largesse.”

—Kate Knibbs

But how does he treat employees? Well, one Tesla employee wrote a Medium post in February decrying the working conditions in the company’s Fremont factory, which isn’t great—and Musk responded by sending out an email discouraging unionization and emphasizing how “fun” the company is. A few months later, The Guardian ran an expose on the grueling conditions in the factory. On the SpaceX front, the company settled a class-action lawsuit brought by former employees in 2017, paying out $4 million to workers who claimed they were underpaid and mistreated. Even if Musk is polite to the employees in his immediate circle, it is clear that he has set up business practices that regular workers find to be plainly unkind. I mean, would you want to work for Musk?

Bereznak: OK, fair points. My general assessment is that Musk is not gushingly nice, but still has a solid moral center. He tries.

I, too, would be horrified if I found myself married to a powerful entrepreneur who repeatedly talked about firing me. But I don’t think it’s fair to judge Musk’s character based on the he-said, she-said of his messy divorce. Plenty of nice people can become incredibly petty when faced with mounting legal fees and public tell-alls. I’m not questioning Justine’s experience, but we should at least keep in mind that she is not an objective third party in this conversation. As a professional writer, she also directly benefited from distilling the ickiest moments from her marriage with Musk in the pages of Marie Claire. Musk’s tell-all wasn’t bitter as much as it was resigned and factual.

Musk seemingly isn’t good at marriage, I think because he wants to spend more time on his company than on anything else. As he said in a 2015 Vogue profile: “You’re not going to create revolutionary cars or rockets on 40 hours a week. It just won’t work. Colonizing Mars isn’t going to happen on 40 hours a week.” Or as Justine said in a viral Quora thread a while back: “Extreme success results from an extreme personality and comes at the cost of many other things.” We don’t know what happened, but it’s possible his failed relationships suffered in part because of his work. And whatever time he does have, he dedicates to his five children—something that even Justine concedes.

For the record, those who have worked closely with Musk don’t describe him as polite; it’s more like a mix of endlessly challenging and frequently inspiring. “It is said that you cannot dream yourself a character; you must hammer and forge one yourself,” wrote Dolly Singh, former head of talent acquisition at SpaceX. “If any leader and any company has done that, and continues to do that, it is SpaceX.” Musk’s passion for achieving his company goals is one of the driving forces that pushes employees forward, and people who vibe with his ideologies get much more from working for Musk than they would any other place.

As for the factory situation, putting workers in life-threatening conditions is inexcusable. I have no rebuttal for that. Points off, for sure. But I will say that Musk is one of the few tech entrepreneurs who has kept his factories in the United States. That has, by default, ensured a certain level of pay and safety regulations that are not afforded to the workers abroad who make wildly popular gadgets like the iPhone.

[ 11/20]

Knibbs: I still wouldn’t want to be friends with, married to, or working for Musk, but when it comes to the next question—Is he trying to make the world a better place?—I’ve got to say that I do think he is. I also think that Musk’s idea of the best possible world would be a technocratic hypercapitalist dystopia ruled by Elon Musk. He’s got a savior complex. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and driven on by Tesla vehicles. Musk is in the business of selling a vision of the future, and I do think he buys into that vision—because it involves his companies securing the future of humanity.

Say we come to a point on this earth where shit really hits the fan, and it’s either colonize Mars or die. If Musk succeeds in establishing a stronghold in the world of privatized space travel, he has already said he plans on charging $200,000 a ticket. He would sell salvation. I do think there’s a good chance he would establish some sort of scholarship or lottery or both to open up spots to people who lacked the money (once he’d already turned a profit). But even in that scenario, Musk would be determining who lived and who died. It’s terrifying.

Basically, I think that Musk wants the world to be a better place, but not as much as he wants to have maximum power in whatever world we live in.

Bereznak: It would make sense that you’d focus on Musk’s space obsession to make your point for this category, but that offers an incomplete picture. When you survey all of the companies Musk has created, it’s clear he’s more die-hard future-environmentalist than power-hungry billionaire. SolarCity blazed the trail for commercial and residential solar panel installations, which are good for the environment. (Musk pushed a cousin to start the company on their way to Burning Man one year, and he later acquired it.) Tesla manufactures desirable battery-powered cars, which are better for the earth than their gas-run counterparts. OpenAI, a nonprofit that Musk cosponsors, is dedicated to ensuring artificial intelligence won’t somehow get smart enough to turn against humans down the line (something Musk frequently warns may happen). The Boring Company and Hyperloop exist to simplify the way humans travel.

Musk is a big-picture infrastructure guy who is into extrapolating hypothetical scenarios (ever heard his hot tub soliloquy about how we might all be living in a simulation?) At first glance, it’d be easy to think that SpaceX’s Mars exploration mission is underpinned by dark, self-centered thinking, but I think it’s just the final logical step in Musk’s ambitious set of companies. He doesn’t want to colonize Mars so he can be some kind of intergalactic dictator. He’s doing it because he knows the government won’t. And in the meantime, his mission to improve earth as best he can is undeniable.

[13/20]

Knibbs: Alyssa and I debated the score for the above section for way too long on Slack, with her awarding Musk full points for his efforts and me assigning him three. Thus, the total score for that section is 13/20, which is very high in my book. But that’s fine, because Musk’s villainy really shines through in regard to the next question: Does he prioritize moral conscience above business profit?

Musk’s business model, from top to bottom, is immoral. It’s not his fault, really. His job as a CEO is to maximize profit, not to act as a moral leader. If he prioritized his moral conscience above business profit, he’d be a science teacher, not a wealth-hoarding titan of industry. He hasn’t been paid as much as $78.2 million annually because of his ethics. It’s because he’s a savvy, ruthless businessman above all else.

“When you survey all of the companies Musk has created, it’s clear he’s more die-hard future-environmentalist than power-hungry billionaire.”

—Alyssa Bereznak

A good way to showcase Musk’s business-over-morals habits is to look at the way he donates money. Yes, like any good tech baron, he participates in plenty of philanthropic endeavors. I’ll give him one point for doling out charity. I would have also awarded him a point for bailing on Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us organization because it supported politicians who were in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline and oil drilling in Alaska, especially since he did it with a pretty memorable kiss-off. “Initially, I agreed to be a part of FWD.us because I agree with immigration reform. But I think the methods that were employed—it was a little too Kissinger-esque, Realpolitik,” he said in 2013. But actions speak louder than words, and Musk has given money to advance his business interests to all sorts of organizations that go against his stated pro-science, pro-environmentalism, pro-immigration beliefs, including the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Bereznak: “Wealth-hoarding titan of industry” is an unnecessarily harsh way to describe Musk, especially when you consider his origin story alongside that of his PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel. Both of them walked away from the sale of PayPal as incredibly wealthy men. Thiel used his earnings to amass even more earnings, which he then used to fund personal victories in the form of destroying Gawker, an emblem of independent journalism, funding a dystopian seasteading project, and supporting Donald J. Trump for president. Musk, in turn, used that money to found Tesla, a company meant to wean America off of its long, unhealthy addiction to oil, and SpaceX, a company that could streamline and modernize space travel. (There are much easier ways to make money.)

In 2008, when Tesla was floundering, Musk arrived at a board meeting to say he would be raising a round of funding from shareholders, even if he was the only one contributing. He eventually invested $20 million of his own money in cash, a move that shocked the board members, and saved the the jobs of everyone in the company. If he cared more about being selfish and rich than he did about changing the world, then he would’ve walked away right then and there, and followed the path of Thiel.

Yes, the man has a lot of money, and knows how to wield it in the interest of his company. But it’s a means to an end that no science teacher, no matter how heroic, would be able to accomplish on his own.

Knibbs: I already touched on Musk’s habit of philanthropic giving, and since it is the subject of our next category—Does he use his personal fortune for good?—I’ll readily admit once more that Musk has a track record of giving money to good causes as well as bad, and I’m happy to reward him for such behavior. I know you mentioned OpenAI earlier, and I think that sponsoring research into artificial intelligence is an unambiguously worthwhile use of Musk’s money. His Musk Foundation has given money to build solar power projects in areas stricken by disaster, and he also donated $1 million to help create a Tesla Museum at the behest of an internet illustrator, and even my cold socialist heart can admit that it was a heartwarming gesture. I’ll give him seven points! He’s a villain, not a demon!

Bereznak: Thank you, Kate, for being so incredibly charitable with your points. Elon “the Villain” Musk would be so proud to see your giving side. Just to be thorough, I should mention that he has also given $10 million to the Future of Life Institute, a Boston-based organization with similar research goals to OpenAI. And he has served on the board of trustees for the X-Prize Foundation, which funds competitions that help support the development of clean energy technology.

It’s important to emphasize that, not only does he give to these causes, he is constantly discussing them at high-profile events and in media interviews, when he could just use that time to promote his own companies. He’s more than just a silent benefactor, he’s an effective self-appointed spokesperson in the areas of renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure development.

[17/20]

Knibbs: And now we’ve come to the last question: Is he honest?

I have two answers for this question, and you’ll like one of them and you’ll hate one of them. The first answer is, yes, Elon Musk is honest, insofar as he can be admirably candid. He admitted that Tesla’s stock was probably overvalued in 2014. And this summer, he answered a Twitter user's invasive query about his mental health with a strikingly blunt existential assessment.

My second answer to this question is that Musk’s occasional conversational frankness might be a type of honesty, but I think that he is a fundamentally deceptive person. I understand why you would see Musk as the good cop to his former PayPal partner Peter Thiel’s bad cop. Musk is very, very skilled at spinning a narrative about his own galactic largesse. He doesn’t just have a tendency to romance actors—he’s damn good at playing the role of a straight-talking, tough-but-fair business leader who wants to push the world into a brighter future. That’s his story, and he has it down pat. But it’s not the whole story. His impact on society is sure to have some benefits, and you outlined some of them earlier: he’s popularizing electric cars, he’s pioneering AI research, he’s filling a void in space exploration. But these benefits will be incidental, and the world Musk is working toward is one that will leave a lot of people in the dust, because it’s a world in which he takes taxpayer money to create transit systems—both on Earth and in space—that will be for-profit entities controlled by Elon Musk. He’s not going to save humanity. He’s going to save the humans who pay him what he demands.

He is not a humanitarian. He is a capitalist with a hero complex—or a villain.

I will give him one point for the Twitter thing, though.

Bereznak: For most of my adult life, I have watched CEOs of pretty much every major company recite boring, canned statements that were clearly written and vetted by a team of PR people. Very rarely do I feel Musk is doing that.

“He’s not going to save humanity. He’s going to save the humans who pay him what he demands.”

—Kate Knibbs

Take, for instance, his aforementioned life simulation theory. That conversation came about unexpectedly at Recode’s Code Conference last year—when Kara Swisher opened the conversation up to questions from the audience, and Outline founder Josh Topolsky randomly asked him a question about whether we’re living in a video game. This is the kind of thing that would startle most corporate figureheads. A question that’s not about my company! From a member of the media! It must be a trap! Maybe they’d blurt out a few words and retreat to a talking point. Not Musk. “I've had so many simulation discussions it's crazy,” he replied. “You've thought about this?"" Topolsky asked. “A lot,” Musk confirmed. He proceeded to drag the conversation into very deep territory: “If a civilization stops advancing then that may be due to some calamitous event that erases civilization,” Musk concluded quite darkly. “Either we're going to create simulations that are indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will cease to exist.”

Does Musk sometimes prematurely hype his company’s accomplishments on Twitter? Who doesn’t? Is he aware of the persona that we, the media, have helped craft in his name? Yes, because he can read. Does he play to the traits that are most admired? In an age when everyone needs a brand, it’d be stupid not to. But I don’t see any of those things as dishonest. He may be a little stubborn, a little crafty, but he’s straightforward enough to tell loyalists that if they come with him to Mars, they must be prepared to die. That people are still willing to follow him to space, or work tirelessly at one of his companies, speaks to his heroism. His life’s work as an environmentalist and explorer is inspiring, and represents a cause worthy of sacrifice.

[10/20]

Knibbs: Alright, let’s tally it up. Our final score collectively comes to a lukewarm 60/100, which is much closer to the number that a villain might get than it is to a hero.

My greatest wish is that Elon Musk reads this and decides to renounce his insatiable will to power and/or encourages his factory workers to unionize. In either case I will be very generous in adjusting his score.

Bereznak: I’m not quite ready to admit I was wrong, but let’s just say you won’t seeing me on any SpaceX flights to Mars anytime soon."
http://fortune.com/2017/09/18/elon-musk-customer-service-twitter/,pos,1.0,9.593572091247643e-17,Elon Musk's Angry Customer Twitter Thread Is Business 101,2017-09-18 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:45:29.269346,Kirsten Korosec,"Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who runs Tesla and SpaceX, is known for his late-night Twitter sessions, often giving his 12.8 million followers the scoop on his growing number of projects. On Friday night, Musk tackled a single customer tweet that quickly spun into a miniature masterclass on how to conduct customer service.

It all started with a tweet to Musk, who had initially posted a video montage of SpaceX’s previous failed efforts entitled “How Not to Land a Orbital Rocket Booster.”

It is common for followers to inundate Musk with questions, many unrelated, once he posts, knowing that he will occasionally answer a few. But one stood out. A tweet at 6:38 p.m. Pacific time Friday night to Musk read: “had a terrible experience with very pushy sales guy from tesla stanford shop while shopping for model x.”

The comment stands out because Tesla is known for its anti-dealership approach to selling its cars. Its showrooms are intended to be pressure-free, pushiness-free places to buy.

Musk responded less than 45 minutes later: “Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That’s what really matters.”

Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 16, 2017

People using Twitter to complain directly to a company isn’t unusual. Nor is it is uncommon for the official company Twitter account to respond (with varying degrees of success). In this case, it’s notable because the head of the company responded—and so quickly—and that it prompted a debate on what it means to be loyal customer.

Musk didn’t weigh in further on the subject, at least not on Twitter. But more than 200 followers did, providing a well of insights on what customer service strategies work and what doesn’t, including Tesla’s Apple-like sales approach.

I had a lovely time visiting Tesla Birmingham. More like an Apple Store than a traditional car dealership. — Prof David Bailey (@dgbailey) September 17, 2017

One of the more interesting comments followed the initial customer’s response to Musk, in which he thanked him for the prompt response, adding “I am a real supporter of tesla and your vision.” That was immediately called into question by another Musk follower who thought the complaining customer couldn’t possibly actually be a Tesla supporter.

However, customers can show their support for a business with their negative feedback. As one follower noted, “only feedback can connect sales to the parent company.”

That's a positive contribution of importance. Only feedback can connect sales to the parent company. — joe quittner (@JoeQuittner) September 16, 2017

Other followers soon posted their own experiences, which usually hit on the two extremes of “amazing” and “terrible.”

Businesses looking to develop the same kind of loyal customer following should pay attention to those non-Tesla owners who commented on the thread. For instance, one man noted that he was treated like a valued customer even after telling the sales rep he would never be able to afford one. Another commentator clearly has visited a Tesla store a number of times even though he doesn’t have the funds yet. The aspiration quality of the Tesla brand is what attracts people to the brand; how they’re treated at the store is what keeps them coming back.

In short: treat everyone who walks in your door the same—an experience that other aspirational companies like Tiffany & Co. do as well.

I'm broke af. Prob will never own a Tesla. Told the same to the salesman in the KOP mall. Was still treated like a valued customer. — Schmoctor (@SchmoctorStone) September 16, 2017

The staff has been great every time I got into a Tesla showroom :)

I visit the store in Austin so much they know me when I walk in with the kids. My 10yr old asks 20 questions every time. — Daniel martin (@_danielrmartin) September 16, 2017

For others commenting on the thread, knowledge of the product and believable enthusiasm was what stood out.

I had an amazing tesla drive in West Vancouver last month. Saleswoman was very knowledgeable and there was zero pressure to buy — Ro Prasad (@Roprasad7) September 16, 2017

I've always had an exceptional experience at Tesla show rooms. Everyones helpful.Makes me want 2 come back just 4 the Tesla love&enthusiasm! — Phoenix Rosa (@ThePhoenixFlare) September 16, 2017

And others offered advice to Tesla and any other brand hoping to reach increasingly savvy customers, including not hiring salesman, and how the staff allowed the product to “sell itself.”

i would recommend not hiring car salesman to sell Teslas. I would use people with HR dept. skills. — Jaybyrd (@TheJewbyrd7777) September 17, 2017

Just fYI – The Sales guys at Boston, Dedham, and Framingham are incredible. They let the car sell itself! — Reed Lewis (@reed_lewis) September 16, 2017

Interestingly, some folks complained about not being approached at all when they visited a Tesla store.

Ditto. — Annette Poliwka (@annettepoliwka) September 16, 2017

The lack of contact complaints show that sometimes the “light sales touch” approach can turn certain customers off."

So as 2018 draws near, here are some of his most notable comments from 2017.

The good

1. Your self-driving car will automatically take you where you want to go In October, a Twitter user suggested to Musk that he would love to be able to get in his car and just tell it where to drive him. According to Musk, it will be even better than that: ""it won't even need to ask you most of the time,"" tweeted the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. 2. There's no reason your Tesla won't be able to fly in the future ""It's certainly possible"" that the next generation high-end Tesla Roadster, which Musk announced in November, will be able to fly for ""short hops,"" said Musk via Twitter. The four-seater, high-performance electric vehicle, due out in 2020, will be able to go 250 miles per hour. The first run of 1,000 Roadsters will cost $250,000 each. The base model will go from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 1.9 seconds, according to Musk, and ""there will be a special option package that takes it to the next level."" 3. Robots will move so fast you need a strobe light to see them In response to a Twitter post of a humanoid robot made by Boston Robotics jumping onto raised surfaces with the caption, ""we dead,"" Musk responded with a warning. ""This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you'll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams…""

The bad

4. Robots will do everything better than us ""There certainly will be job disruption. Because what's going to happen is robots will be able to do everything better than us. ... I mean all of us,"" said Musk, speaking to the National Governors Association in July. ""Yeah, I am not sure exactly what to do about this. This is really the scariest problem to me, I will tell you."" Transportation operators will be the first to lose their jobs, says Musk. (According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one in seven jobs in the U.S. is transportation-related.) But no job is safe, he says. ""Transport will be one of the first to go fully autonomous. But when I say everything — the robots will be able to do everything, bar nothing.""

But the serial tech mogul and billionaire always takes time to share his thoughts on social media, keeping followers informed of his companies’ latest moves. And on Wednesday evening — his 46th birthday, as it happens — that penchant for candid sharing turned into a series of rapid-fire missives about his love for an unusual part of our daily lives: floors.

“I love floors,” Musk mused. “They will never let you down. They are so underappreciated [sic]. Not as much as tunnels though. Just try one. It’s way better than you think. And I don’t care who knows it. Our love will never die.”

While Musk is often lauded for his lofty ambitions (see: space launch company) and insistence on efficient travel), his latest project has been much more earthbound: digging a network of tunnels. Aptly called the Boring Company, it successfully kicked off operations underneath Los Angeles on Wednesday.

Whether these tweets are a hilarious publicity push to get people to think more fondly of tunnels or just Musk’s evening musings after a birthday celebration, the internet had a field day with his top-notch dad jokes and Rick Astley sentiments.

Concerned followers even questioned his sobriety, given the unusual proclamations — but Musk took the time to respond and assuage concerns about his state of health.

Nevertheless, the internet came through with all of the floor, tunnel, stairs, and ceiling puns and jokes, proving that Twitter isn’t such a bad place after all.

(Musk responded to that one, reframing the “elevator” pitch as “a floor that moves.”)

Screenshot Elon Musk's latest company is officially up and running.

The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX said on Twitter on Wednesday evening that his tunnel-boring machine, dubbed Godot, had begun digging under Los Angeles.

Musk officially launched his tunnel company, aptly named The Boring Company, in April.

""No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA,"" Musk said.

Musk said in a Bloomberg profile that the company would begin digging in the SpaceX parking lot. The Boring Company, however, needs to secure permits to dig beyond the SpaceX property line.

Musk's ultimate goal is to relieve congestion by building as many as 30 layers of tunnels beneath Interstate 105 in Los Angeles. Musk has said the tunnels would transport cars on an electric skate and could even accommodate a Hyperloop.

Musk said last Monday that he had ""promising conversations"" with Mayor Eric Garcetti about the project.

Los Angeles is contemplating the addition of an express train that would travel between Los Angeles International Airport and Union Station, a main transit hub that connects Los Angeles to distant suburbs. Garcetti said he was considering using Musk's tunnel to support the rail connection.

The SpaceX parking lot is roughly a five-minute drive from LAX, but securing the necessary permits to dig under the freeway will most likely take time.

Still, Musk is clearly dead serious about making his tunnel network a reality. But he says it will take some more time before Godot can beat his pet snail, Gary."

Musk has a Ford Model T, which a friend gave him, and a Jaguar Series 1 1967 E-type Roadster, he says, via Twitter. Both cars (not Musk's) are pictured below.

I own two gasoline cars. One is a Model T that a friend gave me and the other is a Series 1 '67 E-type Roadster. My first love. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 12, 2017

In an interview with Forbes (conducted while driving in a convertible), Musk says he bought the Jaguar early on in his career because he fancied the car in a book of classic convertibles he got when he was 17. ""I looked through them all and the one I liked the best was the E-Type Jaguar and I said, well, if I can ever afford it, that is the car I am going to get. And so that's why I bought it."" The car, he admits, was a headache. ""That was like a bad girlfriend — it kept breaking down on me and caused me all sorts of trouble,"" says Musk. ""In fact, it broke down on the way back from the dealer."" But he didn't give up on it. When he got a $40,000 bonus from a venture capitalist who invested in him early on, he spent $35,000 of it on the car.

With a fortune hovering around $20 billion, the 46-year-old CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and co-founder of OpenAI has said he won't be happy until we've escaped Earth and colonized Mars.

A notorious workaholic, Musk doesn't spend cash on lavish vacations or expensive hobbies. Instead, the entrepreneur spends most of his time at the office or in factories, retreating to one of his four Los Angeles mansions at the end of the day. Watch to find out what we know about how Musk, a father of five, amassed his fortune and how he spends it. Following is a transcript of the video.

He's been an entrepreneur since an early age. In college, he sold computer parts and would turn his house into a speakeasy on the weekends. After college, he and his brother founded Zip2, their version of an online yellow pages. In 1999, they sold the company and Elon made $22 million. He used that money to co-found X.com, an online banking service. X.com merged with a rival and became PayPal. eBay bought Paypal in 2002 and Musk made $180 million from the deal. He then went on to found SpaceX, Tesla, and Solar City. In 2009, Musk ""ran out of cash"" after divorcing his first wife. He lived off of loans while trying to keep his companies afloat.

That changed when Tesla IPO'ed in 2010. By 2012, Musk was a billionaire. He famously doesn't spend much on luxurious items, but he owns $70 million worth of homes in Los Angeles. He bought one of them for $17 million. It features a two-story library, home theater, gym, and wine cellar. Musk paid $920,000 for a submarine car used in the James Bond movie ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" He's also signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's ""Giving Pledge,"" meaning most of his fortune will be left to charity."

The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence and has no public presence whatsoever, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.

Musk has hinted at the existence of Neuralink a few times over the last six months or so. More recently, Musk told a crowd in Dubai, “Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence.” He added that “it's mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output."" On Twitter, Musk has responded to inquiring fans about his progress on a so-called “neural lace,” which is sci-fi shorthand for a brain-computer interface humans could use to improve themselves.

@BelovedRevol Maybe next month — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017

These types of brain-computer interfaces exist today only in science fiction. In the medical realm, electrode arrays and other implants have been used to help ameliorate the effects of Parkinson’s, epilepsy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, very few people on the planet have complex implants placed inside their skulls, while the number of patients with very basic stimulating devices number only in the tens of thousands. This is partly because it is incredibly dangerous and invasive to operate on the human brain, and only those who have exhausted every other medical option choose to undergo such surgery as a last resort.

This has not stopped a surge in Silicon Valley interest from tech industry futurists who are interested in accelerating the advancement of these types of far-off ideas. Kernel, a startup created by Braintree co-founder Bryan Johnson, is also trying to enhance human cognition. With more than $100 million of Johnson’s own money — the entrepreneur sold Braintree to PayPal for around $800 million in 2013 — Kernel and its growing team of neuroscientists and software engineers are working toward reversing the effects of neurodegenerative diseases and, eventually, making our brains faster and smarter and more wired.

Neuralink joins Kernel in the quest to hack the human brain

“We know if we put a chip in the brain and release electrical signals, that we can ameliorate symptoms of Parkinson's,” Johnson told The Verge in an interview late last year. (Johnson also confirmed Musk’s involvement with Neuralink.) “This has been done for spinal cord pain, obesity, anorexia… what hasn’t been done is the reading and writing of neural code.” Johnson says Kernel’s goal is to “work with the brain the same way we work with other complex biological systems like biology and genetics.”

Kernel, to its credit, is quite upfront about the years of medical research necessary to better understand the human brain and pioneer new surgery techniques, software methods, and implant devices that could make a consumer brain-computer interface a reality. The Wall Street Journal says Neuralink was founded as a medical research company in California last July, which bolsters the idea that Musk will follow a similar route as Johnson and Kernel.

To be fair, the hurdles involved in developing these devices are immense. Neuroscience researchers say we have very limited understanding about how the neurons in the human brain communicate, and our methods for collecting data on those neurons is rudimentary. Then there’s the idea of people volunteering to have electronics placed inside their heads.

“People are only going to be amenable to the idea [of an implant] if they have a very serious medical condition they might get help with,” Blake Richards, a neuroscientist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, told The Verge in an interview earlier this year. “Most healthy individuals are uncomfortable with the idea of having a doctor crack open their skull.”"

She would make his eyes gray and his face more gaunt. She would refashion his public demeanor to be less droll, and she would not countenance his goofy giggle. She would certainly get rid of all his nonsense about the “collective” good. She would find great material in the 45-year-old’s complicated personal life: his first wife, the fantasy writer Justine Musk, and their five sons (one set of twins, one of triplets), and his much younger second wife, the British actress Talulah Riley, who played the boring Bennet sister in the Keira Knightley version of Pride & Prejudice. Riley and Musk were married, divorced, and then re-married. They are now divorced again. Last fall, Musk tweeted that Talulah “does a great job playing a deadly sexbot” on HBO’s Westworld, adding a smiley-face emoticon. It’s hard for mere mortal women to maintain a relationship with someone as insanely obsessed with work as Musk. “How much time does a woman want a week?” he asked Ashlee Vance. “Maybe ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum?” Mostly, Rand would savor Musk, a hyper-logical, risk-loving industrialist. He enjoys costume parties, wing-walking, and Japanese steampunk extravaganzas. Robert Downey Jr. used Musk as a model for Iron Man. Marc Mathieu, the chief marketing officer of Samsung USA, who has gone fly-fishing in Iceland with Musk, calls him “a cross between Steve Jobs and Jules Verne.”As they danced at their wedding reception, Justine later recalled, Musk informed her, “I am the alpha in this relationship.” Photographs by Anders Lindén/Agent Bauer (Tegmark); by Jeff Chiu/A.P.

In a tech universe full of skinny guys in hoodies—whipping up bots that will chat with you and apps that can study a photo of a dog and tell you what breed it is—Musk is a throwback to Henry Ford and Hank Rearden. In Atlas Shrugged, Rearden gives his wife a bracelet made from the first batch of his revolutionary metal, as though it were made of diamonds. Musk has a chunk of one of his rockets mounted on the wall of his Bel Air house, like a work of art. Musk shoots for the moon—literally. He launches cost-efficient rockets into space and hopes to eventually inhabit the Red Planet. In February he announced plans to send two space tourists on a flight around the moon as early as next year. He creates sleek batteries that could lead to a world powered by cheap solar energy. He forges gleaming steel into sensuous Tesla electric cars with such elegant lines that even the nitpicking Steve Jobs would have been hard-pressed to find fault. He wants to save time as well as humanity: he dreamed up the Hyperloop, an electromagnetic bullet train in a tube, which may one day whoosh travelers between L.A. and San Francisco at 700 miles per hour. When Musk visited secretary of defense Ashton Carter last summer, he mischievously tweeted that he was at the Pentagon to talk about designing a Tony Stark-style “flying metal suit.” Sitting in traffic in L.A. in December, getting bored and frustrated, he tweeted about creating the Boring Company to dig tunnels under the city to rescue the populace from “soul-destroying traffic.” By January, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, Musk had assigned a senior SpaceX engineer to oversee the plan and had started digging his first test hole. His sometimes quixotic efforts to save the world have inspired a parody twitter account, “Bored Elon Musk,” where a faux Musk spouts off wacky ideas such as “Oxford commas as a service” and “bunches of bananas genetically engineered” so that the bananas ripen one at a time.

Of course, big dreamers have big stumbles. Some SpaceX rockets have blown up, and last May a driver was killed in a self-driving Tesla whose sensors failed to notice the tractor-trailer crossing its path. (An investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that Tesla’s Autopilot system was not to blame.) Musk is stoic about setbacks but all too conscious of nightmare scenarios. His views reflect a dictum from Atlas Shrugged: “Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.” As he told me, “we are the first species capable of self-annihilation.” Here’s the nagging thought you can’t escape as you drive around from glass box to glass box in Silicon Valley: the Lords of the Cloud love to yammer about turning the world into a better place as they churn out new algorithms, apps, and inventions that, it is claimed, will make our lives easier, healthier, funnier, closer, cooler, longer, and kinder to the planet. And yet there’s a creepy feeling underneath it all, a sense that we’re the mice in their experiments, that they regard us humans as Betamaxes or eight-tracks, old technology that will soon be discarded so that they can get on to enjoying their sleek new world. Many people there have accepted this future: we’ll live to be 150 years old, but we’ll have machine overlords. VIDEO: Elon Musk Multitasks Better Than You Maybe we already have overlords. As Musk slyly told Recode’s annual Code Conference last year in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, we could already be playthings in a simulated-reality world run by an advanced civilization. Reportedly, two Silicon Valley billionaires are working on an algorithm to break us out of the Matrix. Among the engineers lured by the sweetness of solving the next problem, the prevailing attitude is that empires fall, societies change, and we are marching toward the inevitable phase ahead. They argue not about “whether” but rather about “how close” we are to replicating, and improving on, ourselves. Sam Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, the Valley’s top start-up accelerator, believes humanity is on the brink of such invention. “The hard part of standing on an exponential curve is: when you look backwards, it looks flat, and when you look forward, it looks vertical,” he told me. “And it’s very hard to calibrate how much you are moving because it always looks the same.” You’d think that anytime Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates are all raising the same warning about A.I.—as all of them are—it would be a 10-alarm fire. But, for a long time, the fog of fatalism over the Bay Area was thick. Musk’s crusade was viewed as Sisyphean at best and Luddite at worst. The paradox is this: Many tech oligarchs see everything they are doing to help us, and all their benevolent manifestos, as streetlamps on the road to a future where, as Steve Wozniak says, humans are the family pets. But Musk is not going gently. He plans on fighting this with every fiber of his carbon-based being. Musk and Altman have founded OpenAI, a billion-dollar nonprofit company, to work for safer artificial intelligence. I sat down with the two men when their new venture had only a handful of young engineers and a makeshift office, an apartment in San Francisco’s Mission District that belongs to Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s 28-year-old co-founder and chief technology officer. When I went back recently, to talk with Brockman and Ilya Sutskever, the company’s 30-year-old research director (and also a co-founder), OpenAI had moved into an airy office nearby with a robot, the usual complement of snacks, and 50 full-time employees. (Another 10 to 30 are on the way.) Altman, in gray T-shirt and jeans, is all wiry, pale intensity. Musk’s fervor is masked by his diffident manner and rosy countenance. His eyes are green or blue, depending on the light, and his lips are plum red. He has an aura of command while retaining a trace of the gawky, lonely South African teenager who immigrated to Canada by himself at the age of 17.

In Silicon Valley, a lunchtime meeting does not necessarily involve that mundane fuel known as food. Younger coders are too absorbed in algorithms to linger over meals. Some just chug Soylent. Older ones are so obsessed with immortality that sometimes they’re just washing down health pills with almond milk. At first blush, OpenAI seemed like a bantamweight vanity project, a bunch of brainy kids in a walkup apartment taking on the multi-billion-dollar efforts at Google, Facebook, and other companies which employ the world’s leading A.I. experts. But then, playing a well-heeled David to Goliath is Musk’s specialty, and he always does it with style—and some useful sensationalism. Let others in Silicon Valley focus on their I.P.O. price and ridding San Francisco of what they regard as its unsightly homeless population. Musk has larger aims, like ending global warming and dying on Mars (just not, he says, on impact). Musk began to see man’s fate in the galaxy as his personal obligation three decades ago, when as a teenager he had a full-blown existential crisis. Musk told me that The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, was a turning point for him. The book is about aliens destroying the earth to make way for a hyperspace highway and features Marvin the Paranoid Android and a supercomputer designed to answer all the mysteries of the universe. (Musk slipped at least one reference to the book into the software of the Tesla Model S.) As a teenager, Vance writes in his biography, Musk formulated a mission statement for himself: “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment.” OpenAI got under way with a vague mandate—which isn’t surprising, given that people in the field are still arguing over what form A.I. will take, what it will be able to do, and what can be done about it. So far, public policy on A.I. is strangely undetermined and software is largely unregulated. The Federal Aviation Administration oversees drones, the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees automated financial trading, and the Department of Transportation has begun to oversee self-driving cars. Musk believes that it is better to try to get super-A.I. first and distribute the technology to the world than to allow the algorithms to be concealed and concentrated in the hands of tech or government elites—even when the tech elites happen to be his own friends, people such as Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. “I’ve had many conversations with Larry about A.I. and robotics—many, many,” Musk told me. “And some of them have gotten quite heated. You know, I think it’s not just Larry, but there are many futurists who feel a certain inevitability or fatalism about robots, where we’d have some sort of peripheral role. The phrase used is ‘We are the biological boot-loader for digital super-intelligence.’ ” (A boot loader is the small program that launches the operating system when you first turn on your computer.) “Matter can’t organize itself into a chip,” Musk explained. “But it can organize itself into a biological entity that gets increasingly sophisticated and ultimately can create the chip.” Musk has no intention of being a boot loader. Page and Brin see themselves as forces for good, but Musk says the issue goes far beyond the motivations of a handful of Silicon Valley executives. “It’s great when the emperor is Marcus Aurelius,” he says. “It’s not so great when the emperor is Caligula.” III. The Golden Calf

After the so-called A.I. winter—the broad, commercial failure in the late 80s of an early A.I. technology that wasn’t up to snuff—artificial intelligence got a reputation as snake oil. Now it’s the hot thing again in this go-go era in the Valley. Greg Brockman, of OpenAI, believes the next decade will be all about A.I., with everyone throwing money at the small number of “wizards” who know the A.I. “incantations.” Guys who got rich writing code to solve banal problems like how to pay a stranger for stuff online now contemplate a vertiginous world where they are the creators of a new reality and perhaps a new species. Microsoft’s Jaron Lanier, the dreadlocked computer scientist known as the father of virtual reality, gave me his view as to why the digerati find the “science-fiction fantasy” of A.I. so tantalizing: “It’s saying, ‘Oh, you digital techy people, you’re like gods; you’re creating life; you’re transforming reality.’ There’s a tremendous narcissism in it that we’re the people who can do it. No one else. The Pope can’t do it. The president can’t do it. No one else can do it. We are the masters of it . . . . The software we’re building is our immortality.” This kind of God-like ambition isn’t new, he adds. “I read about it once in a story about a golden calf.” He shook his head. “Don’t get high on your own supply, you know?” Google has gobbled up almost every interesting robotics and machine-learning company over the last few years. It bought DeepMind for $650 million, reportedly beating out Facebook, and built the Google Brain team to work on A.I. It hired Geoffrey Hinton, a British pioneer in artificial neural networks; and Ray Kurzweil, the eccentric futurist who has predicted that we are only 28 years away from the Rapture-like “Singularity”—the moment when the spiraling capabilities of self-improving artificial super-intelligence will far exceed human intelligence, and human beings will merge with A.I. to create the “god-like” hybrid beings of the future. It’s in Larry Page’s blood and Google’s DNA to believe that A.I. is the company’s inevitable destiny—think of that destiny as you will. (“If evil A.I. lights up,” Ashlee Vance told me, “it will light up first at Google.”) If Google could get computers to master search when search was the most important problem in the world, then presumably it can get computers to do everything else. In March of last year, Silicon Valley gulped when a fabled South Korean player of the world’s most complex board game, Go, was beaten in Seoul by DeepMind’s AlphaGo. Hassabis, who has said he is running an Apollo program for A.I., called it a “historic moment” and admitted that even he was surprised it happened so quickly. “I’ve always hoped that A.I. could help us discover completely new ideas in complex scientific domains,” Hassabis told me in February. “This might be one of the first glimpses of that kind of creativity.” More recently, AlphaGo played 60 games online against top Go players in China, Japan, and Korea—and emerged with a record of 60--0. In January, in another shock to the system, an A.I. program showed that it could bluff. Libratus, built by two Carnegie Mellon researchers, was able to crush top poker players at Texas Hold ‘Em. Peter Thiel told me about a friend of his who says that the only reason people tolerate Silicon Valley is that no one there seems to be having any sex or any fun. But there are reports of sex robots on the way that come with apps that can control their moods and even have a pulse. The Valley is skittish when it comes to female sex robots—an obsession in Japan—because of its notoriously male-dominated culture and its much-publicized issues with sexual harassment and discrimination. But when I asked Musk about this, he replied matter-of-factly, “Sex robots? I think those are quite likely.” VIDEO: Silicon Valley’s Buffer Zones

Whether sincere or a shrewd P.R. move, Hassabis made it a condition of the Google acquisition that Google and DeepMind establish a joint A.I. ethics board. At the time, three years ago, forming an ethics board was seen as a precocious move, as if to imply that Hassabis was on the verge of achieving true A.I. Now, not so much. Last June, a researcher at DeepMind co-authored a paper outlining a way to design a “big red button” that could be used as a kill switch to stop A.I. from inflicting harm. Google executives say Larry Page’s view on A.I. is shaped by his frustration about how many systems are sub-optimal—from systems that book trips to systems that price crops. He believes that A.I. will improve people’s lives and has said that, when human needs are more easily met, people will “have more time with their family or to pursue their own interests.” Especially when a robot throws them out of work. Musk is a friend of Page’s. He attended Page’s wedding and sometimes stays at his house when he’s in the San Francisco area. “It’s not worth having a house for one or two nights a week,” the 99th-richest man in the world explained to me. At times, Musk has expressed concern that Page may be naïve about how A.I. could play out. If Page is inclined toward the philosophy that machines are only as good or bad as the people creating them, Musk firmly disagrees. Some at Google—perhaps annoyed that Musk is, in essence, pointing a finger at them for rushing ahead willy-nilly—dismiss his dystopic take as a cinematic cliché. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, put it this way: “Robots are invented. Countries arm them. An evil dictator turns the robots on humans, and all humans will be killed. Sounds like a movie to me.” Some in Silicon Valley argue that Musk is interested less in saving the world than in buffing his brand, and that he is exploiting a deeply rooted conflict: the one between man and machine, and our fear that the creation will turn against us. They gripe that his epic good-versus-evil story line is about luring talent at discount rates and incubating his own A.I. software for cars and rockets. It’s certainly true that the Bay Area has always had a healthy respect for making a buck. As Sam Spade said in The Maltese Falcon, “Most things in San Francisco can be bought, or taken.” Musk is without doubt a dazzling salesman. Who better than a guardian of human welfare to sell you your new, self-driving Tesla? Andrew Ng—the chief scientist at Baidu, known as China’s Google—based in Sunnyvale, California, writes off Musk’s Manichaean throwdown as “marketing genius.” “At the height of the recession, he persuaded the U.S. government to help him build an electric sports car,” Ng recalled, incredulous. The Stanford professor is married to a robotics expert, issued a robot-themed engagement announcement, and keeps a “Trust the Robot” black jacket hanging on the back of his chair. He thinks people who worry about A.I. going rogue are distracted by “phantoms,” and regards getting alarmed now as akin to worrying about overpopulation on Mars before we populate it. “And I think it’s fascinating,” he said about Musk in particular, “that in a rather short period of time he’s inserted himself into the conversation on A.I. I think he sees accurately that A.I. is going to create tremendous amounts of value.”

Although he once called Musk a “sci-fi version of P. T. Barnum,” Ashlee Vance thinks that Musk’s concern about A.I. is genuine, even if what he can actually do about it is unclear. “His wife, Talulah, told me they had late-night conversations about A.I. at home,” Vance noted. “Elon is brutally logical. The way he tackles everything is like moving chess pieces around. When he plays this scenario out in his head, it doesn’t end well for people.” Eliezer Yudkowsky, a co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, in Berkeley, agrees: “He’s Elon-freaking-Musk. He doesn’t need to touch the third rail of the artificial-intelligence controversy if he wants to be sexy. He can just talk about Mars colonization.” Some sniff that Musk is not truly part of the whiteboard culture and that his scary scenarios miss the fact that we are living in a world where it’s hard to get your printer to work. Others chalk up OpenAI, in part, to a case of FOMO: Musk sees his friend Page building new-wave software in a hot field and craves a competing army of coders. As Vance sees it, “Elon wants all the toys that Larry has. They’re like these two superpowers. They’re friends, but there’s a lot of tension in their relationship.” A rivalry of this kind might be best summed up by a line from the vainglorious head of the fictional tech behemoth Hooli, on HBO’s Silicon Valley: “I don’t want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do.” Musk’s disagreement with Page over the potential dangers of A.I. “did affect our friendship for a while,” Musk says, “but that has since passed. We are on good terms these days.” Musk never had as close a personal connection with 32-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, who has become an unlikely lifestyle guru, setting a new challenge for himself every year. These have included wearing a tie every day, reading a book every two weeks, learning Mandarin, and eating meat only from animals he killed with his own hands. In 2016, it was A.I.’s turn. Zuckerberg has moved his A.I. experts to desks near his own. Three weeks after Musk and Altman announced their venture to make the world safe from malicious A.I., Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that his project for the year was building a helpful A.I. to assist him in managing his home—everything from recognizing his friends and letting them inside to keeping an eye on the nursery. “You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in Iron Man,” he wrote. One Facebooker cautioned Zuckerberg not to “accidentally create Skynet,” the military supercomputer that turns against human beings in the Terminator movies. “I think we can build A.I. so it works for us and helps us,” Zuckerberg replied. And clearly throwing shade at Musk, he continued: “Some people fear-monger about how A.I. is a huge danger, but that seems far-fetched to me and much less likely than disasters due to widespread disease, violence, etc.” Or, as he described his philosophy at a Facebook developers’ conference last April, in a clear rejection of warnings from Musk and others he believes to be alarmists: “Choose hope over fear.” In the November issue of Wired, guest-edited by Barack Obama, Zuckerberg wrote that there is little basis beyond science fiction to worry about doomsday scenarios: “If we slow down progress in deference to unfounded concerns, we stand in the way of real gains.” He compared A.I. jitters to early fears about airplanes, noting, “We didn’t rush to put rules in place about how airplanes should work before we figured out how they’d fly in the first place.” Zuckerberg introduced his A.I. butler, Jarvis, right before Christmas. With the soothing voice of Morgan Freeman, it was able to help with music, lights, and even making toast. I asked the real-life Iron Man, Musk, about Zuckerberg’s Jarvis, when it was in its earliest stages. “I wouldn’t call it A.I. to have your household functions automated,” Musk said. “It’s really not A.I. to turn the lights on, set the temperature.” Zuckerberg can be just as dismissive. Asked in Germany whether Musk’s apocalyptic forebodings were “hysterical” or “valid,” Zuckerberg replied “hysterical.” And when Musk’s SpaceX rocket blew up on the launch pad in September, destroying a satellite Facebook was leasing, Zuckerberg coldly posted that he was “deeply disappointed.” IV. A Rupture in History

Musk and others who have raised a warning flag on A.I. have sometimes been treated like drama queens. In January 2016, Musk won the annual Luddite Award, bestowed by a Washington tech-policy think tank. Still, he’s got some pretty good wingmen. Stephen Hawking told the BBC, “I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Bill Gates told Charlie Rose that A.I. was potentially more dangerous than a nuclear catastrophe. Nick Bostrom, a 43-year-old Oxford philosophy professor, warned in his 2014 book, Superintelligence, that “once unfriendly superintelligence exists, it would prevent us from replacing it or changing its preferences. Our fate would be sealed.” And, last year, Henry Kissinger jumped on the peril bandwagon, holding a confidential meeting with top A.I. experts at the Brook, a private club in Manhattan, to discuss his concern over how smart robots could cause a rupture in history and unravel the way civilization works. In January 2015, Musk, Bostrom, and a Who’s Who of A.I., representing both sides of the split, assembled in Puerto Rico for a conference hosted by Max Tegmark, a 49-year-old physics professor at M.I.T. who runs the Future of Life Institute, in Boston. “Do you own a house?,” Tegmark asked me. “Do you own fire insurance? The consensus in Puerto Rico was that we needed fire insurance. When we got fire and messed up with it, we invented the fire extinguisher. When we got cars and messed up, we invented the seat belt, air bag, and traffic light. But with nuclear weapons and A.I., we don’t want to learn from our mistakes. We want to plan ahead.” (Musk reminded Tegmark that a precaution as sensible as seat belts had provoked fierce opposition from the automobile industry.) Musk, who has kick-started the funding of research into avoiding A.I.’s pitfalls, said he would give the Future of Life Institute “10 million reasons” to pursue the subject, donating $10 million. Tegmark promptly gave $1.5 million to Bostrom’s group in Oxford, the Future of Humanity Institute. Explaining at the time why it was crucial to be “proactive and not reactive,” Musk said it was certainly possible to “construct scenarios where the recovery of human civilization does not occur.” Six months after the Puerto Rico conference, Musk, Hawking, Demis Hassabis, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and Stuart Russell, a computer-science professor at Berkeley who co-authored the standard textbook on artificial intelligence, along with 1,000 other prominent figures, signed a letter calling for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons. “In 50 years, this 18-month period we’re in now will be seen as being crucial for the future of the A.I. community,” Russell told me. “It’s when the A.I. community finally woke up and took itself seriously and thought about what to do to make the future better.” Last September, the country’s biggest tech companies created the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to explore the full range of issues arising from A.I., including the ethical ones. (Musk’s OpenAI quickly joined this effort.) Meanwhile, the European Union has been looking into legal issues arising from the advent of robots and A.I.—such as whether robots have “personhood” or (as one Financial Times contributor wondered) should be considered more like slaves in Roman law. At Tegmark’s second A.I. safety conference, last January at the Asilomar center, in California—chosen because that’s where scientists gathered back in 1975 and agreed to limit genetic experimentation—the topic was not so contentious. Larry Page, who was not at the Puerto Rico conference, was at Asilomar, and Musk noted that their “conversation was no longer heated.” But while it may have been “a coming-out party for A.I. safety,” as one attendee put it—part of “a sea change” in the last year or so, as Musk says—there’s still a long way to go. “There’s no question that the top technologists in Silicon Valley now take A.I. far more seriously—that they do acknowledge it as a risk,” he observes. “I’m not sure that they yet appreciate the significance of the risk.” Steve Wozniak has wondered publicly whether he is destined to be a family pet for robot overlords. “We started feeding our dog filet,” he told me about his own pet, over lunch with his wife, Janet, at the Original Hick’ry Pit, in Walnut Creek. “Once you start thinking you could be one, that’s how you want them treated.” He has developed a policy of appeasement toward robots and any A.I. masters. “Why do we want to set ourselves up as the enemy when they might overpower us someday?” he said. “It should be a joint partnership. All we can do is seed them with a strong culture where they see humans as their friends.” When I went to Peter Thiel’s elegant San Francisco office, dominated by two giant chessboards, Thiel, one of the original donors to OpenAI and a committed contrarian, said he worried that Musk’s resistance could actually be accelerating A.I. research because his end-of-the-world warnings are increasing interest in the field. “Full-on A.I. is on the order of magnitude of extraterrestrials landing,” Thiel said. “There are some very deeply tricky questions around this . . . . If you really push on how do we make A.I. safe, I don’t think people have any clue. We don’t even know what A.I. is. It’s very hard to know how it would be controllable.” He went on: “There’s some sense in which the A.I. question encapsulates all of people’s hopes and fears about the computer age. I think people’s intuitions do just really break down when they’re pushed to these limits because we’ve never dealt with entities that are smarter than humans on this planet.” V. The Urge to Merge

Trying to puzzle out who is right on A.I., I drove to San Mateo to meet Ray Kurzweil for coffee at the restaurant Three. Kurzweil is the author of The Singularity Is Near, a Utopian vision of what an A.I. future holds. (When I mentioned to Andrew Ng that I was going to be talking to Kurzweil, he rolled his eyes. “Whenever I read Kurzweil’s Singularity, my eyes just naturally do that,” he said.) Kurzweil arrived with a Whole Foods bag for me, brimming with his books and two documentaries about him. He was wearing khakis, a green-and-red plaid shirt, and several rings, including one—made with a 3-D printer—that has an Sfor his Singularity University. Computers are already “doing many attributes of thinking,” Kurzweil told me. “Just a few years ago, A.I. couldn’t even tell the difference between a dog and cat. Now it can.” Kurzweil has a keen interest in cats and keeps a collection of 300 cat figurines in his Northern California home. At the restaurant, he asked for almond milk but couldn’t get any. The 69-year-old eats strange health concoctions and takes 90 pills a day, eager to achieve immortality—or “indefinite extensions to the existence of our mind file”—which means merging with machines. He has such an urge to merge that he sometimes uses the word “we” when talking about super-intelligent future beings—a far cry from Musk’s more ominous “they.” I mentioned that Musk had told me he was bewildered that Kurzweil doesn’t seem to have “even 1 percent doubt” about the hazards of our “mind children,” as robotics expert Hans Moravec calls them. “That’s just not true. I’m the one who articulated the dangers,” Kurzweil said. “The promise and peril are deeply intertwined,” he continued. “Fire kept us warm and cooked our food and also burned down our houses . . . . Furthermore, there are strategies to control the peril, as there have been with biotechnology guidelines.” He summarized the three stages of the human response to new technology as Wow!, Uh-Oh, and What Other Choice Do We Have but to Move Forward? “The list of things humans can do better than computers is getting smaller and smaller,” he said. “But we create these tools to extend our long reach.” Just as, two hundred million years ago, mammalian brains developed a neocortex that eventually enabled humans to “invent language and science and art and technology,” by the 2030s, Kurzweil predicts, we will be cyborgs, with nanobots the size of blood cells connecting us to synthetic neocortices in the cloud, giving us access to virtual reality and augmented reality from within our own nervous systems. “We will be funnier; we will be more musical; we will increase our wisdom,” he said, ultimately, as I understand it, producing a herd of Beethovens and Einsteins. Nanobots in our veins and arteries will cure diseases and heal our bodies from the inside. He allows that Musk’s bête noire could come true. He notes that our A.I. progeny “may be friendly and may not be” and that “if it’s not friendly, we may have to fight it.” And perhaps the only way to fight it would be “to get an A.I. on your side that’s even smarter.” Kurzweil told me he was surprised that Stuart Russell had “jumped on the peril bandwagon,” so I reached out to Russell and met with him in his seventh-floor office in Berkeley. The 54-year-old British-American expert on A.I. told me that his thinking had evolved and that he now “violently” disagrees with Kurzweil and others who feel that ceding the planet to super-intelligent A.I. is just fine. Russell doesn’t give a fig whether A.I. might enable more Einsteins and Beethovens. One more Ludwig doesn’t balance the risk of destroying humanity. “As if somehow intelligence was the thing that mattered and not the quality of human experience,” he said, with exasperation. “I think if we replaced ourselves with machines that as far as we know would have no conscious existence, no matter how many amazing things they invented, I think that would be the biggest possible tragedy.” Nick Bostrom has called the idea of a society of technological awesomeness with no human beings a “Disneyland without children.” “There are people who believe that if the machines are more intelligent than we are, then they should just have the planet and we should go away,” Russell said. “Then there are people who say, ‘Well, we’ll upload ourselves into the machines, so we’ll still have consciousness but we’ll be machines.’ Which I would find, well, completely implausible.” From the V.F. Summit: Elon Musk on Thinking for the Future

Russell took exception to the views of Yann LeCun, who developed the forerunner of the convolutional neural nets used by AlphaGo and is Facebook’s director of A.I. research. LeCun told the BBC that there would be no Ex Machina or Terminator scenarios, because robots would not be built with human drives—hunger, power, reproduction, self-preservation. “Yann LeCun keeps saying that there’s no reason why machines would have any self-preservation instinct,” Russell said. “And it’s simply and mathematically false. I mean, it’s so obvious that a machine will have self-preservation even if you don’t program it in because if you say, ‘Fetch the coffee,’ it can’t fetch the coffee if it’s dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal. And if you threaten it on your way to getting coffee, it’s going to kill you because any risk to the coffee has to be countered. People have explained this to LeCun in very simple terms.” Russell debunked the two most common arguments for why we shouldn’t worry: “One is: It’ll never happen, which is like saying we are driving towards the cliff but we’re bound to run out of gas before we get there. And that doesn’t seem like a good way to manage the affairs of the human race. And the other is: Not to worry—we will just build robots that collaborate with us and we’ll be in human-robot teams. Which begs the question: If your robot doesn’t agree with your objectives, how do you form a team with it?” Last year, Microsoft shut down its A.I. chatbot, Tay, after Twitter users—who were supposed to make “her” smarter “through casual and playful conversation,” as Microsoft put it—instead taught her how to reply with racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic slurs. “bush did 9/11, and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now,” Tay tweeted. “donald trump is the only hope we’ve got.” In response, Musk tweeted, “Will be interesting to see what the mean time to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft’s Tay a day.” With Trump now president, Musk finds himself walking a fine line. His companies count on the U.S. government for business and subsidies, regardless of whether Marcus Aurelius or Caligula is in charge. Musk’s companies joined the amicus brief against Trump’s executive order regarding immigration and refugees, and Musk himself tweeted against the order. At the same time, unlike Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Musk has hung in there as a member of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. “It’s very Elon,” says Ashlee Vance. “He’s going to do his own thing no matter what people grumble about.” He added that Musk can be “opportunistic” when necessary. I asked Musk about the flak he had gotten for associating with Trump. In the photograph of tech executives with Trump, he had looked gloomy, and there was a weary tone in his voice when he talked about the subject. In the end, he said, “it’s better to have voices of moderation in the room with the president. There are a lot of people, kind of the hard left, who essentially want to isolate—and not have any voice. Very unwise.” VI. All About the Journey"

SAN FRANCISCO — Electric cars dotting the planet. Rockets racing to Mars. Solar panels eliminating oil dependency.

If there's anything else entrepreneur has on his To Do list, he'll have to also invent life-extension technology just so he can stick around long enough to get everything done.

And now there's another venture: creating micro-implants that, once inserted in the brain, can not just fix conditions such as epilepsy but potentially turn your brain into a computer-assisted powerhouse. Time to screen The Matrix, people.

Musk is said to be investing in a new company called Neuralink, according to a report on The Wall Street Journal website Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Late Monday, he confirmed the idea was in motion, tweeting that a ""long Neuralink piece"" was set to come out on the Wait But Why blog of Tim Urban in about a week. ""Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to,"" Musk wrote.

Neuralink's focus is on cranial computers, or the implanting of small electrodes through brain surgery that beyond their medical benefits would, in theory, allow thoughts to be transferred far more quickly than, say, thinking a thought and then using thumbs or fingers or even voice to communicate that information.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the report, which included confirmation of Musk's involvement from Max Hodak, a ""member of the founding team"" who previously cofounded robotic lab services company Transcriptic.

But the topic clearly has been on the big brain of Musk, 45, who is already busy wrangling the ambitious plans of Tesla (which combines the electric automaker's goals to democratize electric vehicles with a mission to make solar energy more practical) and SpaceX (whose rockets are winning government contracts but whose mission is decidedly focused on Mars).

Musk has also come up with the idea for Hyperloop, a high speed transportation system being pursued by other companies, and has posited that the solution for traffic in Los Angeles, where he lives, could be provided by his new drilling venture playfully called The Boring Company. Musk also is on a few business councils convened by President Trump.

At a conference in June, Musk cautioned that “if you assume any rate of advancement in (artificial intelligence), we will be left behind by a lot.""

@BelovedRevol Making progress. Maybe something to announce in a few months. Have played all prior Deus Ex. Not this one yet. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 28, 2016

In August, Musk tweeted a reply to a question about how his research into ""neural lace"" was going. ""Making progress,"" Musk tweeted. ""Maybe something to announce in a few months.""

In late 2015, Musk joined a group that launched OpenAI, a non-profit aimed an promoting open-source research into artificial intelligence. Experts have cautioned that while the exponential growth in computing power could lead to breakthroughs in science and health, misuse of such tech could doom the species. As could being lapped intellectually by our sentient computing friends.

""I don't know a lot of people who love the idea of living under a despot,"" Musk said last June.

But, he added, ""If AI power is broadly distributed to the degree that we can link AI power to each individual's will — you would have your AI agent, everybody would have their AI agent — then if somebody did try to something really terrible, then the collective will of others could overcome that bad actor.""

Internal sources told The Journal that the company, called Neuralink, was developing ""neural lace"" technology that would allow people to communicate directly with machines without going through a physical interface. Neuralink was registered as a medical-research company in California in July.

Neural lace involves implanting electrodes in the brain so people could upload or download their thoughts to or from a computer, according to the report. The product could allow humans to achieve higher levels of cognitive function.

Musk said on Twitter that more details about Neuralink will be released in a week.

Musk has expressed his interest in neural lace technology before. Musk first described the potential product at Vox Media's Code Conference in 2016, saying it would allow humans to achieve symbiosis with machines.

He said neural lace could prevent a person from becoming a ""house cat"" to artificial intelligence.

""The solution that seems maybe the best is to have an AI layer,"" Musk said at the Vox Code Conference. ""A third, digital layer that could work symbiotically.""

Musk said on Twitter in January that he was preparing for an announcement regarding neural lace.

Facebook is also exploring similar technology through Building 8, its secretive hardware division. The group is developing noninvasive brain-computer interface technology that would allow people to communicate with external hardware devices.

Musk is attempting to set up safety standards for artificial intelligence through his nonprofit, OpenAI, which he founded with Y Combinator's Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI's mission is to ""advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.""

But Neuralink's first products could involve using implants to treat disorders like epilepsy or major depression, according to The Journal.

Researchers at universities like the University of California and Duke are also developing brain-computer interface technology that would allow people with paraplegia to walk again.

Musk also plans to launch the Boring Company, a venture dedicated to building an underground network of tunnels to reduce traffic.

Elon Musk wants to hack the brain.

The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla has launched a medical research company called Neuralink in California, the Wall Street Journal reported. The goal is to create brain-computer interfaces that would allow humans to connect directly with what he's called ""the digital version of yourself"" — electronic devices.

Musk has previously urged the upgrade of human cognition to prevent people from being made obsolete by artificial intelligence. [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]

Musk has been teasing the possibility of a venture into computer-brain interfaces for months. He spoke at Recode's Code Conference in 2016 about the need to speed up human ""output."" Essentially, he said, humans are incredibly rapid at taking in information, but slow at outputting information to their digital devices. At the World Government Summit in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, in January, Musk called artificial intelligence ""dangerous"" because it could render humans obsolete.

""This is going to be a massive social challenge,"" he said at the conference.

Musk advocated a universal basic income, or a basic payment to unemployed people around the world, to confront these challenges. But he also floated the idea of a ""merger with biological intelligence and machine intelligence.""

""To some degree, we are already a cyborg,"" Musk said at the Dubai conference. ""You think about the digital tools you have, your phone, your computer, the applications that you have. … You already have a digital tertiary layer.""

Currently, people interact with their devices by thumb-typing on their phones, Musk said. A ""high-bandwidth interface to the brain"" would help achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and could make humans more useful in an AI-driven world, he said.

In science fiction, this idea is sometimes called ""neural lace"" for the netting of electronic implants that would presumably be required for such an interface.

Brain-human interfaces must overcome steep challenges, though. So far, there have been a few successful brain-implant devices in humans, all designed to treat serious neurodegenerative conditions or neurological injuries. Deep-brain stimulation, electrical pulses delivered into the brain, is sometimes used to slow the symptoms of Parkinson's disease when medications fail to work, for example.

Several patients with spinal cord injuries have been fitted with implants giving them some control over robotic limbs, or even their own limbs. This represents a leap from animal tests to experimental use on humans in less than a decade, according to a paper in the journal Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience. Nevertheless, wrote Gytis Baranauskas, a neurophysiologist at the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, the rate by which electronic systems transfer impulses from the brain to the limb or prosthetics (or vice versa) lags far beyond natural nerve impulses, especially for complex movements. It's not the electronic technology that limits this transfer of information, Baranauskas wrote in the Frontiers paper, but a lack of understanding of what neuron activity in the brain really means.

In other words, there is a lot more neuroscience to do before anything close to neural lace becomes a reality. There are also risks to consider: It's one thing to chance a 1 percent to 3 percent likelihood of a brain bleed, stroke or infection to implant an electrode in an effort to slow a fatal disease like Parkinson's. It's another thing altogether to consider surgery that would probably be far more invasive so that people could better control their computers.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO posted a challenge on Twitter after Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday that his aerospace giant would transport the first humans to Mars. “Eventually we’re going to go Mars and I firmly believe the first person that sets foot on Mars will get there on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg told CNBC’s Jim Cramer this morning.

In response to a tweet from the “Fortune Tech” Twitter account linking to Fortune’s news article about Muilenburg’s bold bet, Musk simply wrote, “Do it.”

Here’s Musk’s tweet:

Do it — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2017

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Muilenburg has made the same proclamation in the past, including last year at a tech conference. However, Musk’s own very public ambitions to not only reach Mars, but to colonize the Red Planet, seem to have linked the celebrity billionaire’s name with the idea of Mars exploration in the public imagination. In October, Musk outlined the SpaceX strategy for reaching Mars and even his goal of settling large groups of people on the planet as part of his vision of making humans into a “multiplanetary species.”

Musk believes that SpaceX could begin landing spaceships on Mars as soon as 2022, while Muilenburg said on Thursday’s that Boeing’s own next generation rockets would be tested starting in 2019.

Musk is an active Twitter user who is known to jump into the Twitter conversations among Tesla customers and critics. Last year, the billionaire even engaged in a brief Twitter spat with Fortune (including blocking Fortune‘s primary Twitter account) over its reporting in the wake of a Tesla driver’s fatal crash and Musk’s post-crash sale of Tesla shares in a public offering."
https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/9/16742136/spacex-elon-musk-tesla-roadster-falcon-heavy-mars-international-space-law,pos,1.0,3.0189298943692874e-19,Is Elon Musk even allowed to send his car to deep space?,2017-12-09 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:45:48.883669,Dec,"After much fanfare, Elon Musk made it clear that he does plan to launch his Tesla Roadster to Mars on the Falcon Heavy next year — but questions remained over whether the mission is allowed. Are there any major federal hurdles SpaceX has to overcome in order to launch the very first sports car into deep space?

Musk initially said he wanted to send the car to Mars orbit, which could raise concerns about planetary protection. That’s the concept of preventing contamination of worlds in our Solar System with Earth life. Honoring planetary protection is a matter of international law, as it’s mandated in the Outer Space Treaty — a 50-year-old document that dictates guidelines for what countries can and cannot do in space. And the US is ultimately responsible for US commercial space companies adhering to the treaty.

“It’s a dummy payload — an exquisite dummy payload.”

The Tesla Roadster isn’t really going to Mars, though, so SpaceX isn’t going to run afoul of international space law; instead, the car will be delivered near where Mars orbits around the Sun, about 141 million miles from Earth, and then left to travel forever through space, according to further clarification from Musk. As long as the Roadster doesn’t interfere with the Red Planet, SpaceX should be fine. “It’s a dummy payload — an exquisite dummy payload — but what it does fall down to is it’s not performing any operation in space,” Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, tells The Verge.

If SpaceX wanted the Roadster to perform a specific task — such as land on Mars or an asteroid — it would be a different story. Such a mission would fall into a weird regulatory gap that has been plaguing the US government for a while now. The US has successfully overseen the launch and licensing of commercial satellites in orbit around Earth for the last 50 years, but there’s currently no legal framework to oversee what are deemed “non-traditional” commercial space missions. These include things like sending a rover to the Moon, launching a human habitat into orbit... or sending a car to Mars.

“One of the big challenges is how does the government say yes to a lot of these new innovative private sector space activities,” Brian Weeden, a space expert and director of programming for the Secure World Foundation, tells The Verge.

The process for launching satellites has been more or less streamlined for a while. Companies that want to send up a payload have to apply for a license with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in order to use part of the radio spectrum to communicate with the satellite. And they also have to apply for a launch license with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which ensures that the mission will not cause damage to property on the ground or be a danger to the public.

“how does the government say yes to a lot of these new innovative private sector space activities.”

But when a mission involves more than launching satellites, that’s where companies enter something of a Wild West scenario. There is no framework for overseeing a company’s actions in space; once a vehicle deploys from a rocket into orbit, that’s where federal jurisdiction ends. “The FAA’s authority is over the launch vehicle; once the payload separates, they have no authority there,” says Weeden.

That’s starting to become a problem as space companies propose more ambitious missions. The US government needs a way to ensure that companies won’t get the nation in trouble by violating the Outer Space Treaty while in space. And planetary protection is definitely a concern, as more companies talk about sending spacecraft to the Moon or Mars. The treaty states that countries should explore other worlds and “conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination.”

Currently, NASA adheres to strict planetary protection guidelines set forth by an international agency called COSPAR, which details how spacecraft should be handled depending on where they’re going. Earth is teeming with microbes that can easily hitchhike on spacecraft, and if we contaminate another planet with our own bacteria, it’ll be hard to study that alien world in its pristine state. So for any spacecraft heading to a place that might host life, such as Mars, there are important rules to follow.

COSPAR rules say that rockets that send spacecraft to Mars have to have a less than one in 10,000 chance of hitting the planet. And Mars orbiters don’t have to adhere to strict cleaning requirements, as long as there is a 99 percent chance of missing Mars in 20 years, and a 95 percent chance of missing the planet in 50 years. “There are no particular requirements that would have to be met if that orbit is not going to impact Mars for a long period of time,” John Rummel, NASA’s former planetary protection officer, tells The Verge.

the upcoming Falcon Heavy test flight does illustrate the need for a regulatory framework

If SpaceX wanted to do more with the Roadster, however, then it might run into some friction. Such a scenario happened last year when private spaceflight company Moon Express sought approval to send its future lunar lander to the Moon. The company feared the State Department might step in to block the launch; there was no way for the government to ensure that Moon Express would follow the law while on the Moon. So as a short-term solution, Moon Express voluntarily offered the State Department all the details of how the company would comply with the Outer Space Treaty. It’s possible SpaceX may do something similar.

“I’m sure knowing the way SpaceX operates, they’re giving them everything but the kitchen sink and being incredibly diligent on this process,” says Stallmer.

Oddly enough, the upcoming Falcon Heavy test flight does illustrate the need for a regulatory framework — and soon. SpaceX has not been silent about its deep space ambitions, and once the Falcon Heavy is online, the company has even bigger plans for the rocket beyond launching cars. For instance, SpaceX plans to send two tourists around the Moon as early as next year (though there hasn’t been much of an update on that). And SpaceX has even bigger plans to build the new BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket, which could someday take people to the surface of the Moon and Mars.

Fortunately, Congress is working on a solution. In June, the House passed the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017, which would give the Department of Commerce oversight of commercial activities in space. It’s still unclear exactly if and when this bill will become law, but it’s clear that something is needed. The lack of oversight in this area is becoming harder to ignore. As Weeden says: “This is just another example of how the commercial space world is outpacing the existing oversight process.”"

""I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket.""

During the interview, the CEO had outlined Boeing’s plans for their mission. “We’re working on that next generation rocket right now with our NASA customers called ‘Space Launch System,'” Muilenburg said. “This is a rocket that’s about 36 stories tall, we’re in the final assembly right now, down near New Orleans. And we’re going to take a first test flight in 2019 and we’re going to do a slingshot mission around the moon.” Muilenburg has taunted Musk on other previous occasions about the two companies' unofficial space race. At a tech conference last year, the confident CEO made a very similar statement to the crowds saying, “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket. ""

Elon Musk simply reacted to Muilenburg's challenge with a tweet saying, ""Do it"".

Do it — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2017

Musk wants to be on Mars before 2024

Musk hasn’t been shy about his plans to realize a successful mission to Mars. He outlined his plans to get to Mars in a paper titled, “Making Humans a Multi-Planetary Species” that was published in New Space Journal in June this year.

Musk who is also the CEO of electric car company Tesla plans to get to Mars using a 42-engine rocket, called BFR. He has suggested the mission is on course to reach the red planet by 2024. The BFR has the capacity to carry around 100 people or 150 tons of cargo. The SpaceX website describes their Mars mission with a quote from Musk saying, “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that's what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”

Boeing will build the ""Deep Space Gateway"" to launch missions

Boeing has teamed up with NASA to realize their Mars mission. It seems they plan to build the “Deep Space Gateway”, a high-tech space station that can be used as a launch pad for deep space missions. The space habitat could support research endeavors and be a base for lunar missions from both commercial or governmental collaborations. It would be powered by a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) system.

The aerospace company believes they could assemble the floating base in just four Space Launch System (SLS) missions. “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s,” said Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. NASA is on board with the project and explain that the NASA/Boeing launch system would have the capacity to launch “a small deep-space habitat module”."

Well, serial entrepreneur and inventor Elon Musk seems to experience life in somewhat the same way. The Tesla, SpaceX, and Boring Company boss believes everything should happen more quickly than most people assume is possible. In Elon’s world, deadlines are shorter, three months is a long development time, and 2020? That’s the distant future.

An “Elon year,” it’s clear, doesn’t equal one lap around the sun. So we broke out the slide rules and crunched the numbers, based on his deadlines, deliveries, and predictions. Our (totally scientific, promise!) calculations show that for Mr. Musk, one year is equivalent to something like 8 years for the rest of the world.

Building a Rocket

In 2002 Musk decided to start SpaceX to build his own rockets, after deciding buying Russian ones was too expensive. In 2008 his Falcon 1 became the first privately funded rocket to reach orbit.

In 2000, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos launched Blue Origin, another private space venture. Although the company has also demonstrated a soft landing of a rocket, it has only managed to make it to the relatively accessible edge of space. Its New Glenn launch vehicle which will actually make it into orbit is expected to launch prior to 2020.

That’s six years, versus 20, or a time ratio of 1:3.33

Make a Self-Driving Car

Ford says it’ll have a fully self-driving car serving customers by 2021. Uber and Volvo are working on the same timeframe. Musk, meanwhile, says a Tesla will drive itself across the country sometime by the end of 2017.

One year, versus four, or a time ratio of 1:4

Zip From Los Angeles to San Francisco

California’s High Speed Rail project promises travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles at up to 220 miles per hour, or under three hours for the whole trip.

Elon conjured up the Hyperloop, which would allow travel in near-vacuum tubes at around 700 mph, and do the trip in 30 minutes. At this stage both are probably equally unrealistic.

30 mins versus 180 mins, or a time ratio of 1:6

Dig a Tunnel

Elon is digging a tunnel. Nobody really knows why—something to do with avoiding traffic. He calls it the beginning of an experiment. He says a snail moves 14 times faster than a modern tunnel boring machine. His Boring Company’s goal is to defeat the snail in a race, and in the process upend the tunneling industry and save humans from soul-sucking traffic.

That’s a time ratio of 1:14.

Sell an Affordable Electric Car

“Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared,” Musk in his Master Plan, Part Deux in 2016. That didn’t stop him, and this is one area where Musk’s insane, public, deadlines influenced another company to do better. Chevrolet took a concept Bolt EV, shown at the Detroit Auto Show in Jan 2015, and had it on sale by December 2016. Pretty impressive.

The Tesla Model 3 was first shown to the public in March 2016, and production of cars is due to start in July 2017, although the first off the line will go to employees. (Of course, both vehicles were in development long before they were shown, but still.)

16 months, versus 24, or a time ratio of 1:1.5

Run a Car Production Line

Elon is big on building the machine that builds the machine. His factories are just as important a product as the car, battery, or solar panel they spit out. And he thinks he can make them run a lot faster. “The exit rate of cells will be faster than bullets from a machine gun,"" he said of battery cells from the Gigafactory in 2016.

A modern car production line runs fast enough to easily spit out a completed car every three minutes.

Musk’s Model S and Model X production line in Fremont, California currently runs at about 5cm per second. He says Tesla can make it 20 times faster. That’s one meter per second. That would mean a car is spat out every 10 seconds, ish, maybe faster.

180 seconds, versus 10 seconds, is a time ratio of 1:18

Go to Mars

NASA hopes to get humans to Mars by the 2030s. Musk wants his SpaceX company to start a civilization (of millions) on the red planet by the 2060s, with first manned missions in the 2025 timeframe.

1 year, versus 8 is a time ratio of 1:8

The Math

Average out the time ratios on Elon Musk's various projects, and you get 1:7.83, indicating that Musk typically plans to do in one year, what it would take the average human to do in nearly eight years. Not that dissimilar to your canine companion. No wonder the busiest man in tech gets so much done."

Yet during a Q&A at the Tesla shareholder meeting Tuesday, Musk took a question, submitted on Twitter, about how he relaxes after work. After initially acknowledging that his after-hours agenda is “usually work more,” Musk said he typically does “normal stuff” off the clock. Last weekend, for example, he saw the new hit movie Wonder Woman with his kids. (He has also recently been photographed ziplining in Australia, and earlier this week tweeted while visiting the DMV.)

After a moment’s hesitation, though, the Tesla (tsla) CEO added that he has other pastimes, or at least habits. “Sometimes go crazy on Twitter,” he told shareholders at the meeting. “Yeah with a little red wine, vintage record player, some Ambien—magic! Magic happens,” he continued. (Ambien is a sleep medication that can be prescribed for insomnia; doctors recommend against taking it with alcohol.)

He repeated the comments in a tweet a few hours later.

A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien … and magic! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017

Musk also assured Tesla shareholders that even if he often tweets about his other companies, most of them take up very little of his time.

After all, Musk explained, he spends at least 90% of his time on either the electric car company or SpaceX; 3% to 5% on Neuralink, a venture aiming to create interfaces between the human brain and machine-learning technology; 2% on his new tunneling project called the Boring Company; and the remainder on OpenAI, a non-profit dedicated to artificial intelligence research.

“I might tweet a lot about the Boring Company, which is basically a hobby—I wouldn’t even call it a real company right now,” Musk said. “It’s got three people, some interns and some part-time people. There’s, like, no pressure.”

Tesla, which besides developing self-driving cars is also pushing into solar power after acquiring SolarCity last year, tends to keep him the most busy, Musk added. “Tesla is like a drama magnet, so I have to deal with Tesla drama,” he said.

(For more on Tesla, see the new Fortune feature, “Tesla Takes Off In China.”)

Musk also hinted that he is working to improve the song selection available in Tesla cars, where he prefers to listen to music, and that there would be “some exciting announcements” about that later this year. By Musk’s description, the new offering sounded a bit like a potential competitor to Spotify: “I think it’s very hard to find good playlists and good matching algorithms,” Musk said. “I think it could work really great. This is going to be the music you want to listen to. Well, at least I want to listen to it.”

As for another popular American form of recreation, Musk (who grew up in South Africa) said he has little use for it: “It may not shock you, but sports is not something I do a lot of.”"

A few months later Bloomberg confirmed that he had actually launched a boring company that was in the middle of digging a giant pit, a decision he made in the spur of the moment.

But lately, Musk has been a little extra. His tweets have been more erratic than normal over the past week, coincidentally (or perhaps not so coincidentally) around the same time President Trump announced the United States would withdraw its participation in the Paris climate accord.

He tweeted this Tuesday night, in reference to a statement he had made explaining his erratic tweets during Tesla’s shareholder meeting on Monday.

A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien … and magic! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017

I’m not a record aficionado myself, but I have a hunch that record owners don’t make a point of calling their record players “vintage.”

Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017

As Forbes’s Bertel Schmitt explains, many of Musks’s plans for the car company — including his announcement that Tesla is going to build a new factory in an undetermined location in order to crank out SUVs by 2019 — are just as insane as his tweets.

Such a schedule could only be made under heavy doses of red wine, vintage records, and Ambien. Permit to completion, a single family house can take a year. A new car plant takes anywhere from three to five years from ground breaking to car making. Depending on the location, permitting could add another year. Musk doesn’t even know where that new Gigafactory will be, and he wants it to make cars in two years? It takes a lot of drugs and alcohol to come up with such a plan, preferably with ‘Lucy in the sky with diamonds’ on the turntable, or elsewhere. [. . . ] Anywhere else in the auto industry, if you would announce plans like that, you would be submitted to a drug test, and fired. Anywhere else in the auto industry, you would design modular platforms that underpin many models, so that you don’t have to develop the same 80% of the car again and again. Anywhere in the auto industry, eight models and more roll off the same line, maximizing CapEx and capacity. Of course, if you build your cars from tangerine trees, marmalade skies, and a fistful of pills, and if you are high on a $60 billion valuation of your company, such rules do not apply.

This isn’t the first time Musk has made pie-in-the-sky promises to his investors, which often go unfulfilled. In March, SpaceX announced it planned to send two tourists to the moon by next year, a laughable goal. As I wrote back then, Musk’s companies don’t have a good track record of keeping their promises. SpaceX has repeatedly missed deadlines to send NASA astronauts to the International Space Station and keeps blowing up expensive payloads.

The day before the big Tesla investor meeting, Musk suggested he doesn’t wear underwear.

Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2017

Gross.

He then jokingly took credit for the company’s stock increase, which happened to occur after his underpants revelation.

If you have to explain a metaphor, it probably isn’t a very good one.

This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 6, 2017

He then posted a photo of himself and made a weird, nonsensical joke about how Telsa went public 1,000 years ago.

Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can’t believe it’s been 1000 years since we went public. A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jun 6, 2017 at 10:37am PDT

He then tried to explain the joke in a subsequent tweet, saying that the photo is black and white because they didn’t have color photos 1,000 years ago. But 1,000 years ago there was no film, so. . . haha. . ?

That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 6, 2017

He later quipped that he looked good for being 500 years old.

And um … not trying to brag or anything, but I think I look good for 500 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017

But it doesn’t make any sense that he would be younger than his own company. Even in the context of this very odd joke, this tweet is mind-bogglingly weird.

One of his followers played along and asked Musk what his secret is to looking so young for being 500 years old, which the PayPal founder said has to do with a stringent skincare routine.

A 7 step facial treatment every morning. The mistake people make is stopping at 6. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017

This sounds eerily similar to Christian Bale’s character’s morning routine in “American Psycho.”

This brings me to the question at hand: is Musk losing it? Are his tweets, his sleeping pill and wine cocktail confessions, and boring machines a desperate cry for help, or just a joke? What is not funny about any of his actions is the fact that my tax dollars are funding his eccentricities. American taxpayers have given Musk somewhere upwards of $4.9 billion in federal funds alone. Call me crazy, but I am not a fan of eccentric behavior I’m forced to fund."

Follow Elon Musk's 3 Rules Every Day,2017-12-30 08:51:39,2019-06-24 14:45:56.105411,Author + 'The Leader'S Mindset + How To Win In The Age Of Disruption' + The Opinions Expressed Here Inc.Com Columnists Are Their Own + Not Those Of Inc.Com.,"Throughout history we tend to remember bold thinkers. Try changing the world while being un-bold. Elon Musk revels in thinking big, from inventing the most exciting car company of the 21st century (Tesla) to making space travel a reality (SpaceX). At the last count, Musk has disrupted at least five different industries (Payments, Cars, Space, Transport and Batteries). Even among fellow entrepreneurs, the scale of Musk's risk taking sets him apart from most entrepreneurs who tackle the world's biggest problems.

3 Rules For More Courage.

1. The Biggest Risk You Can Take Is Not Taking A Risk.

In a world where uncertainty is high, you can afford to take risks as long as you fail cheap, learn fast and move on. Musk shows that you must disrupt your usual ways of thinking in order to get started. He gave himself a 100-day timeline to fix South Australia's power network by building the world's largest battery farm in the world or declared it would be free. Setting a self-imposed deadline is a powerful way to get momentum and close the gap from talk to action. What bold new idea are you ready to commit to today?

2. Failure Pioneer.

One of the most popular books among entrepreneurs is the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius's Meditations. This seminal book is based around a single cogent idea: ""You have power over your mind -- not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."" Musk would probably be the first to apply this mantra to his own life. His story is a model for overcoming obstacles, fighting for what you believe in, and not giving up. He comes from a foundation of deep humility. It's OK to be wrong. It's OK to fail. It doesn't make you a worthless human being. In an interview for CNN's Top 10 Thinkers, he says: ""When starting out Tesla and SpaceX, in both cases, I thought the odds of success were less than 50%... So it's not as though I was convinced that it would all work. I thought, 'Well, it probably won't work, but it's worth a try because the outcome is important.""

3. Viking Spirit.

Musk is brave not just in his words but his actions, and he uses failure in a systematic way to pivot fast. He says: ""We should not be afraid of doing something just because some amount of failure is likely to occur. If our forefathers had taken that approach, the United States wouldn't exist."" Like modern-day explorers ascending K2 or reaching the North Pole, Musk has what the Finnish call sisu, a flair for ""extraordinary determination and resoluteness in the face of extreme adversity"". It takes sisu to jump into the unknown and embrace uncertainty. Where sisu flourishes, entrepreneurs report higher levels of hope (unshakeable self-belief), optimism (expecting good things to happen), perseverance (commitment to the purpose and not giving up easily), and resilience (ability to adapt to obstacles and recover quickly).

Next Steps."

Less than two weeks ago, Musk became $5 billion richer, Bloomberg first reported, raising his worth up to $21.3 billion. He is now the 37th most wealthy person in the world, according to Bloomberg's index of the world's 500 richest people.

According to Tesla's 2017 annual proxy statement, Musk's total cash compensation consists of an annual base salary of $45,760, but he doesn't actually accept it. While he doesn't accept an annual salary, Musk is one of the best-compensated executives. In fact, Bloomberg reports he earned a total of $99,744,920 including stock options and a spot in the top five highest paid executives in 2016.

He comes from a family of entrepreneurs

His mom, Maye Musk, is a model, nutritionist and sparked the entrepreneurial spirit in his family. While Elon works on and digging urban , Kimbal is pioneering a sustainable food movement and Tosca is making moves in the film industry with her upcoming launch of PassionFlix, the Netflix for romance movies.

He survived on $1 a day at age 17

Musk moved from his native South Africa to begin his college studies in North America. He first emigrated to ""see what it takes to live,"" he tells Neil DeGrasse Tyson on his StarTalk radio show in 2015. Musk found that ""in America, it's pretty easy to keep yourself alive.""

""My threshold for existing is pretty low, I figured could be in some dingy apartment with my computer and be okay,"" Musk tells DeGrasse Tyson. So he tried to live on one dollar per day. He did so by buying food in bulk at the supermarket. ""I went more for the hotdogs and oranges, you do get really tired of hotdogs and oranges after a while,"" Musk says, mixing things up every now and then with some ""pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce"" which he said could ""go pretty far too.""

He's a Ph.D. dropout

""When I was in college I was thinking, well, what is going to most affect the future of humanity? You know, electric cars, solar power, essentially sustainable consumption,"" Musk tells DeGrasse Tyson on StarTalk. He started studying physics at Queen's University in Canada, transferred after two years to the University of Pennsylvania and got a second bachelor's degree in economics at the Wharton School. He continued on to Stanford to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics but dropped out to start a company with his brother.

He ran a speakeasy in college

While at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk found a fellow transfer student, Adeo Ressi, to rent an off-campus house, Business Insider reports according to the school's alumni magazine. The two started hosting parties as a way to not only meet people, but also make some money. The alumni magazine reports Ressi and Musk hired bouncers, cleaning crews and still charged enough to pocket a little extra money. ""They do that sort of thing all the time now, but back when we did it (in the 1990s), everyone thought it was clever and businesslike,"" Ressi tells the magazine.



He has a series of traditions with his five kids...

A week ahead of his anticipated Thanksgiving Day SpaceX launch in 2013, he tweeted about a pre-launch tradition he has with his kids. Together, they visit Disney World, just an hour drive from SpaceX's launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

...and he created a school for them"

Whether you're an athlete or a startup founder or an artist, the conventional wisdom for decades has been that specialization leads to mastery leads to inevitable success.

It makes perfect sense and has worked for countless experts, but then there's Elon Musk, who seems to focus on everything all at once, upending entire industries each time he sets his attention on something new.

Surely it helps that Musk made a bundle very young with PayPal, which he could spend on Tesla and SpaceX, and that he has a legendary work ethic. But some keen observers suspect Musk's lack of a singular focus may actually be the secret to his repeated successes.

Entrepreneur and author Michael Simmons has studied Musk and his career and sees an alternate theory of success in the serial founder's biography.

""I call people like Elon Musk 'expert-generalists,'"" Simmons wrote recently on Medium. ""Expert-generalists study widely in many different fields, understand deeper principles that connect those fields, and then apply the principles to their core specialty.""

Part of the idea, as Simmons explains it, is that instead of becoming all-knowing in a narrow field, as most of us are encouraged to do, Musk has always been ravenous to learn about a variety of things, which allows him to transfer things he's learned about one area to other areas where they might be applicable.

This is clearly what fuels some of his most innovative endeavors -- he made the connection between solar power and Tesla's electric cars, and between his interest in artificial intelligence and ways it will make Teslas autonomous. This type of ""learning transfer"" goes even further -- perhaps one day connecting Teslas to the neural lace implanted in a driver's brain.

This isn't a phenomenon solely animated by Elon Musk. Calls for more interdisciplinary studies and collaboration among various fields have been heard for decades as well.

But with increasingly crowded markets of all types, we assume that generalists are a dime a dozen and specialization is the better strategy not only to be competitive, but perhaps also to even command a premium for whatever your expertise might be."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/australia/elon-musk-south-australia-battery.html,pos,0.9999999972257858,2.774240363596185e-09,Australia Powers Up the World’s Biggest Battery — Courtesy of Elon Musk,2017-11-30 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:45:59.555437,Adam Baidawi,"“This fits into his M.O. of doing these big, grandstanding things to get attention for the company and the technology that he’s building,” said Ashlee Vance, the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Musk. “Tesla’s at this really critical stage where they’re trying to be both a car company and an energy company at the same time.”

Australia is a fitting target for Mr. Musk. The country is the world’s largest exporter of coal. By most measures, it is the sunniest continent on earth. It has abundant wind and hydroelectric power capabilities. And yet the cost of electricity in Australia increased 20 percent from 2012 to 2016, and Australians this year paid between 50 and 100 percent more for their power than Americans, according to experts.

South Australia has the highest electricity prices in the world. This imbalance of supply and demand has resulted in regular blackouts and astronomical bills for the state’s 1.7 million residents.

The high-capacity Tesla battery does not create energy, it just stores it. The state already invests in wind and solar energy. The battery would give it a bank of saved energy, which could ease pressure during periods of high demand and help better manage the electrical grid.

“More than 40 percent of South Australia’s electricity is coming from wind, which is good,” said Tony Wood, an energy director at the Grattan Institute, a think tank. “But the consideration of how to integrate it — and manage that intermittency — wasn’t so good.”

The day after Mr. Weatherill was roused from his couch in March, he and Mr. Musk spoke on the phone about the proposal. The Australian, knowing the tech mogul’s ability to stir the news media, had one demand: If Tesla were to win the contract, Mr. Musk would appear in South Australia to announce it to the world.

“He usually doesn’t come for announcements of winning a tender,” Mr. Weatherill said, “but he said he’d come.”"
https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-better-things-than-tesla/,pos,1.0,9.232991396607131e-29,Elon Musk Has Better Things to Do Than Run Tesla,2017-07-29 11:00:00,2019-06-24 14:46:01.044578,Alex Davies + Aarian Marshall + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"With the long-awaited Model 3 finally rolling out of a bustling factory and Tesla poised to take its place among mainstream automakers, perhaps the time has come for Elon Musk to step aside from the day-today of building cars. He could focus on some of his other grand ideas for changing the transportation world: his rockets, tunnels, and hyperloops. Simply put, he possesses far too much talent and ambition to run an automaker.

If Musk sincerely wants Tesla to usher in a new era of transportation, one in which everyone whisks about in electric vehicles powered by the sun, he might do better to find someone suited to the mundanity of the task. Musk is a rare talent, a brilliant visionary unafraid to pursue big, crazy dreams. He is exactly the type of person you need running a company elbowing its way into the auto industry, which he has done.

But Musk is ill-suited to Tesla’s next phase, one in which it must master all the boring stuff old automakers have spent a century perfecting: nailing efficiencies, meeting deadlines, solidifying supply chains, wrestling with labor, and squeezing profits out of remarkably narrow margins.

That’s not to say Musk should drive his shiny new Model 3 into the sunset. Tesla aspires to be an energy company, one that sells solar panels and enormous batteries to complement its sexy electric vehicles. That is precisely why Musk should relinquish his role as CEO, stop wasting his time hanging out on the assembly line, and devote his talents to mapping out that new world—while also figuring out how to colonize Mars, prevent the AI apocalypse, and drill under LA.

“Elon Musk would probably do well to elevate himself to the role of supreme leader, visionary, and soul of the company, and hire one or two really solid auto professionals who know how to run the business,” says Bob Lutz, an auto industry veteran who most recently served as GM’s product chief.

Musk wouldn’t be the first. Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google, Bill Gates at Microsoft, and Howard Schultz at Starbucks all stepped back from quotidian operations to focus on bigger things. Musk must do the same, for his sake and Tesla’s.

The Car Business

Friday’s Model 3 launch marked Tesla’s transition from startup to established automaker with Muskian ambitions. The South African-born CEO wants to build 5,000 Model 3 sedans each week by the end of the year, and double that in 2018. As Tesla continues cranking out Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, Musk aims to sell half a million cars next year, a sixfold increase from last year. It could be the fastest ramp-up in automotive history. Or a colossal failure.

“If they don’t have somebody inside the company that is a master at building vehicles and establishing supply lines and lean manufacturing and dealing with the labor component, they’re going to struggle,” says Jeff Owens, the former CTO of Delphi, a major industry supplier.

Tesla has little room for error. The average car features roughly 3,000 parts, each of which must fit together perfectly. They come from hundreds of suppliers, and if any one of them fails to arrive in the right form, the right number, or at the right time, production can break down. Get it all right, and Tesla can expect to see a profit margin of no more than 6 percent. Get it wrong and, well, the company might as well burn the money. At least it would save on heating bills.

Tesla has yet to turn a profit in the five years since it started selling the Model S, and the company shows little regard for deadlines. The S arrived about a year after its original due date, and the X nearly two years late. Yet investors show little concern. Earlier this year, Tesla’s valuation surpassed that of Ford and (briefly) General Motors. But even if investors continue showing patience, losing cash is never a good look. Anyone tasked with making the Model 3 profitable faces grueling work.

“It is an all-consuming, double digit-hour day job, six or seven days a week,” says Tony Posawatz, a former General Motors engineer who has led multiple product lines, including the development of the hybrid electric Chevrolet Volt.

As a rule, auto industry CEOs rely on seasoned, trusted lieutenants to get the job done. Even at a smaller outfit like Tesla, you need to spread the responsibility. “A flat management structure where everything comes to Musk is untenable at a certain volume level,” Owens says.

Musk did hire Audi veteran Peter Hochholdinger last year to run production. He swiped Charles Kuehmann from Apple to head up materials engineering and tapped top battery researcher Jeff Dahn. But nothing suggests he has relinquished control. The self-described “nano-manager” famously sweats the minutia of Tesla’s operations. In a May 2016 conference call, he boasted he had moved his desk to the end of the Model 3 production line in Tesla’s Fremont factory and kept a sleeping bag in a nearby conference room.

Beyond consistently blowing production deadlines, Tesla struggles with quality control. Musk claims he has learned from past hiccups, and made the Model 3 as simple as possible to ease production—no falcon doors or other frivolities, for example, and more straightforward steel construction instead of aluminum. Still, the addition of another car, with its own architecture, software, and materials, makes it even harder to get this right, especially since its far lower base price will make any mistakes all the more costly.

The Boredom Company

Musk may now be synonymous with Tesla, but Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning founded the automaker in 2003. Musk came aboard as chairman of the board a year later, after selling his share of Paypal to eBay. He helped design the Roadster, Tesla’s remarkable proof of concept, but only immersed himself in the details of the business when he took over as CEO in 2008.

Beyond running Tesla, he keeps busy leading SpaceX and OpenAi, the artificial intelligence venture he founded in 2015 with Sam Altman. He spends some time on Neuralink, a company trying to merge the human brain with computers. He hosts competitions for students designing the hyperloop, the tube-based high-speed transportation network he dreamed up. Then there’s the Boring Company, which he created to dig traffic-killing tunnels … somewhere. “We have no idea what we’re doing—I want to be clear about that,” he said of his mole mission in January.

If all these projects, plus his tweets praising floors (“I love floors”) indicate he’s getting bored of the car business, that’s more a feature than a bug of his personality. Musk bounces from one idea to the next because they just keep coming to him. That’s another reason to rethink his role at Tesla.

Musk is spark and kindling, the oh-so-rare person who combines bold ideas, the smarts to make them happen, and the salesmanship to convince others to climb aboard. Plenty of people can manage supply chains and track production numbers. Few can make serious progress toward colonizing Mars, manifest an industry dedicated to stuffing people into high-speed vacuum tubes, and make a serious (if not convincing) argument that the trick to conquering traffic is a massive network of tunnels.

A New Role

The question, then: Why doesn’t Tesla ask Musk to take a step back from daily operations, focus on the big picture, and rely on competent and experienced lieutenants with the autonomy to do their jobs? Why waste his talent for innovation and creating enthusiasm on building cars? And though Musk recently told investors he’ll stick around as long as Tesla will have him, back in 2013, he said he’d consider leaving Tesla once the Model 3 reached the market. So clearly, he’s at least considered it, even if not recently.

For models, Musk could look to Google co-founders Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, who have moved in and out of daily management at Google. Page now leads Google parent company Alphabet, lifting him far above the noise of the daily work (he’s also running a flying car project). Brin ran Google X, the shop for out-there inventions, and is developing an airship on the side. Or Musk could make like Bill Gates, who ceded the day-to-day running of Microsoft to Steve Ballmer when he stepped down as CEO in 2000. (Gates surrendered his chairmanship in 2014, and now runs one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations.)

“The best leaders know when to transition, when to bring in expertise of other kinds,” says Patricia Lenkov, founder of headhunting firm Agility Executive Search. “When they don’t you end up in crisis mode.” That crisis hasn’t arrived yet, but the scale of the Model 3 project, and the likelihood that at least something will go wrong, could easily change that.

If he really likes the CEO title, Musk could follow Mark Zuckerberg’s route, and hire a Sheryl Sandberg-type figure as a COO, someone to buckle down on operations and the like.

If Musk does choose to hand his CEO crown to someone focused on daily operations, his chairmanship of the Tesla board and close ties to most of its members would let him retain much of his clout. Along with brother Kimbal Musk, the board includes investors in Musk’s other projects, including SolarCity (which Tesla acquired last year), and SpaceX. (Musk added two new independent directors last week, after investors complained the CEO was too tight with the board).

He’s got plenty of good CEO candidates to choose from. He could hire recently canned Ford CEO Mark Fields, who with his predecessor Alan Mulally helped Ford dodge bankruptcy and grow quickly over the past decade. He could bring in someone with lower profile figure like Pam Fletcher, an engineer by training and now GM’s head of autonomy and electrification. He could promote from within, naming production chief Peter Hochholdinger his successor.

Whatever the route, Tesla should keep Musk as its public face, its chief champion and salesman. His magic touch is too valuable to abandon—and too valuable to waste."

Cohan,"Buried in Tesla’s better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings was a small detail that might terrify a lesser C.E.O. than Elon Musk: Tesla, despite having about $3.5 billion on its balance sheet, is somehow running out of cash at ludicrous speeds.

The simple explanation for Tesla’s quick cash burn is that launching a new car is expensive. The Model 3, Tesla’s forthcoming, more affordable electric sports sedan, requires revamping the company’s manufacturing process, which is expensive. Hundreds of thousands of people have pre-ordered the new model, the production of which Musk expects will drain Tesla’s balance sheet down to $1 billion after its launch.

On Wednesday, Musk explained that Tesla can launch the Model 3 without raising more money, but it would probably be prudent to have some extra cash on hand. “How close to the edge do we want to go? According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3, but we get very close to the edge,” Musk told analysts on a conference call after reporting earnings this week. But since “that’s probably not the best thing for shareholders,” he continued, “it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce the risk.”

Being “very close to the edge” is not new for Musk, who famously went deep into personal debt during the financial crisis, as both Tesla and SpaceX, the private space company for which he also serves as founder and C.E.O., veered close to insolvency. (Venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, who has invested in both businesses, has called Musk the “most risk-immune person I’ve ever met.”) Tesla and SpaceX pulled through, but Musk remains far from a spendthrift leader: Bloomberg reports that from 2014 to the end of the first half of 2017, Tesla will have spent $10 billion in capital expenditures and research and development.

Investors have remained patient with Tesla, which has time and again missed its own production targets for its Model S and Model X vehicles. After missing its targets for the first two quarters of 2016, Musk reassured shareholders that things would be different in the second half of the year, and that Tesla would be able to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 vehicles by year’s end. It didn’t. But with Model 3 production slated to begin this summer at a $35,000 price point, Tesla says it plans to manufacture at high volumes that should bend the company’s cost curve.

The new car “is designed for manufacturing,” Musk said Wednesday, and will be easier to build. He expects production of the Model 3 to increase to 5,000 vehicles a week by the fourth quarter of 2017. At some point next year, that number will double. “There’s obviously going to be a fair bit of incremental investment to go from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week, but it’s going to be a lot less than getting to 5,000 cars a week in the first place,” he added. It's hoped the Model 3’s numbers will be good enough to assure investors they made the right choice in giving Musk so much leeway over the years."

The win comes after multiple failures for the SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who wants to change the way people travel and send humans to Mars. Since his childhood, books have played a crucial role in fueling Musk's ambitions. It's said that he read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica at age nine and would pore through science fiction novels for more than 10 hours a day. When asked how he learned about rockets, Musk reportedly said, ""I read books."" His voracious reading habit was essential to launching his history-making career.

Here are eight books that shaped the revolutionary entrepreneur: 1. ""Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down"" by J.E. Gordon



When Musk decided he wanted to learn rocket science, he studied textbooks on astrophysics and engineering. While reading advanced texts on physics may not be for everyone, this book offers a lighter take on the science behind SpaceX. ""It is really, really good if you want a primer on structural design,"" Musk says in an interview with KCRW.

2. ""Benjamin Franklin: An American Life"" by Walter Isaacson



Ben Franklin, author, inventor, scientist and diplomat, is one of Musk's heroes. ""You can see how [Franklin] was an entrepreneur,"" Musk says in an interview with Foundation's Kevin Rose. ""He was an entrepreneur. He started from nothing. He was just a runaway kid."" 3. ""Einstein: His Life and Universe"" by Walter Isaacson



Musk tells Rose he was influenced by the biography of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, and it's clear why. Some of Einstein's most famous quotes, like ""The important thing is not to stop questioning,"" and ""Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new,"" speak directly to Musk's vision for his companies. 4. ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"" by Nick Bostrom

Though Musk is a futurist and deeply interested in artificial intelligence, he has shared his worries about potential dangers and ethical concerns associated with the technology. Bostrom's book, which deals with the potential challenges presented should computational intelligence surpass human intelligence, is ""worth reading"" Musk tweeted in 2014. 5. ""Merchants of Doubt"" by Erik M. Conway and Naomi Oreskes

Musk recommends this argument by two historians who believe that scientists with political and corporate connections have purposefully muddied the facts around many public health issues, such as the negative effects of smoking. He posted his recommendation on Twitter in 2013. 6. ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding

This classic novel on survival, competition and greed left its mark on the tech entrepreneur. ""The heroes of the books I read always felt a duty to save the world,"" he tells the New Yorker. 7. ""Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future"" by Peter Thiel



The book, based on notes from a popular class Thiel taught at Stanford University in 2012, focuses on the need for unique thinking among would-be startup founders. Musk says that his Paypal co-founder's book offers an interesting exploration of the process of building super successful companies. 8. The ""Foundation"" trilogy by Isaac Asimov

In a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Musk says Asimov's books taught him that ""civilizations move in cycles,"" a lesson that encouraged the entrepreneur to pursue his radical ambitions. ""Given that this is the first time in 4.5 billion years where it's been possible for humanity to extend life beyond Earth,"" he says, ""it seems like we'd be wise to act while the window was open and not count on the fact it will be open a long time."" Check out how Elon Musk got his start.

He explained on Twitter that camping atop the Gigafactory was faster than getting to a hotel in Reno, the nearest town of any size.

""I really believe that one should lead from the front lines and that's why I'm here.""

""I always move my desk to wherever — well, I don't really have a desk, actually. I move myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla,"" said Musk.

Musk was hosting the call from the Gigafactory, Tesla's battery production facility in Nevada, because that is where he has been working day and night to correct production delays, he said.

Elon Musk disappointed Wall Street investors in the most recent quarter and Tesla stock is taking a pummeling Thursday as a result. But during Tesla's earnings conference call with analysts on Wednesday, there was a notable theme: Musk presented himself as a leader who's out on the field alongside his employees.

Btw, just want to express a word of appreciation for the hard work of the Tesla Gigafactory team. Reason I camped on the roof was because it was less time than driving to a hotel room in Reno. Production hell, ~8th circle …

Indeed, on Wednesday's call, Musk said he has been at the Gigafactory all hours of the night.

""I am personally on that line, in that machine, trying to solve problems personally where I can,"" Musk said. ""We are working seven days a week to do it. And I have personally been here on zone 2 module line at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning, helping diagnose robot calibration issues. So I'm doing everything I can.""

In July, Musk predicted that getting the production of Tesla Model 3 ramped up would be ""manufacturing hell. "" On Wednesday, he likened the experience to ""Dante's Inferno,"" admitting that it was emotionally taxing.

""Let's say level nine is the worst, OK? Well, we were in level nine,"" he said. ""I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago when I realized that we're kind of in level nine,"" he said. ""I was sort of quite down in the dumps.""

But things are looking up. ""We're now in level eight and I think we're close to exiting level eight,"" said Musk. ""Now I can see sort of a clear path to sunshine. So I feel really pretty optimistic right now.""

It's not the first time Musk has publicly talked about his roller coaster of emotions. At the end of July, Musk said the reality of being a successful, high-profile tech CEO is ""great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress.""

The recent stress of Tesla's production schedule for the Model 3 falling behind (much to the dismay of analysts) is partially because a key subcontractor did not deliver as expected. Musk said on the call that he and his team were putting in overtime work to correct the miss. However, it's not the first time Tesla has missed production estimates. Musk has a history of setting projections the company then doesn't meet.

In any case, ""[A]t the end of the day, everything is our fault – and my fault most of all,"" admitted Musk. ""If we pick the wrong subcontractor, we're the fault. So, I don't want to just be externalizing responsibility.""

Musk's stories about working long hours, elbow to elbow with his employees may be in part a strategy to mollify investors unhappy with Tesla's missed targets. But it's also is a smart leadership move."

""Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" Musk said Thursday on Twitter, shortly after the president announced from the Rose Garden that he would begin the process of leaving the accord.

Musk had vowed to step down from the advisory councils he sits on if the president pulled out of the pact.

""I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain,"" he said Wednesday on Twitter.

Musk was one of 18 business leaders serving on Trump's chief business advisory council, known as the Strategic and Policy Forum. He was also an adviser on the president's manufacturing jobs initiative, and has met with Trump to talk about infrastructure spending.

Disney CEO Bob Iger also announced Thursday that he's resigning from the Strategic and Policy Forum -- bumping the number of high-profile CEO departures up to two.

""As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal,"" Iger said on Twitter.

Related: Bob Iger quits Trump advisory team as 'matter of principle'

Musk, in particular, has been under fire from the start for his willingness to engage with the Trump administration.

In April, a startup investor shelled out $400,000 to run ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post urging Musk to ""dump Trump."" It was part of a $1 million bid to persuade the billionaire CEO that he shouldn't work with Trump, given their sharp ideological differences, especially on climate change.

Until now, Musk had said he thought it was prudent to put his differences with Trump aside so he could have a seat at the table. This isn't the first time Musk has publicly opposed the Trump administration.

Musk adamantly disagreed with Trump's decision to sign an executive order in January that temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim-majority nations.

Despite his concerns, Musk decided to remain on the president's business councils -- even as Uber CEO Travis Kalanick departed amid public pressure.

""Advisory councils simply provide advice, and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration,"" Musk said in a statement, posted on Twitter at the time.

Musk's decision to leave is a bold move from a man who has a lot of skin in the game.

SpaceX has scored a number of lucrative government contracts in recent years. The company is currently fulfilling a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to send supplies to the International Space Station. It also has an $82.7 million contract to send a U.S. Air Force satellite into space in 2018. Last month, it launched a spy satellite for a U.S. intelligence agency.

In fact, SpaceX has an ISS resupply mission scheduled for later this week.

But transitioning the world sustainable energy is the crux of Tesla's business -- and Musk's personal brand.

When Tesla (TSLA) starting accepting deposits for its Solar Roof in May, Musk reiterated his belief that the world is moving toward that widespread use of green power.

""That's the vision for the future we think is the only sensible vision for the future -- and the one we're building toward,"" he said."

He's got the good life, right? But that doesn't mean it's easy.

""The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two,"" says Musk's tweet.

A Twitter follower asked Musk to elaborate on how he manages it. Musk says he doesn't have a great solution.

""I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing,"" he says.

Musk has previously said that he is driven by a passionate desire to make the future better. ""We are doing what we can to have the future be as good as possible, to be inspired by what is likely to happen and to look forward to the next day,"" he says in a recent speech to the National Governor's Association.

Sunday, on Twitter, Musk was also asked if he was bipolar, to which Musk replied, ""yeah,"" but then he explained further, saying his psychological highs and lows are associated with actual ups and downs in his life.

""Maybe not medically tho,"" says his tweet. ""Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for.""

That, he says, is part of what it means to be an entrepreneur trying to change the world.

""If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell …""

Long-time venture capitalist Fred Wilson responded to Musk's tweets on his own blog, AVC.

""What [Musk] describes in that tweet is the life of an entrepreneur. And also, to some extent, the life of a VC who cares. The unrelenting stress is the hardest of the three in my opinion. Stress is part of life, we all have it,"" Wilson says in the post published Monday. ""But starting and running companies brings stress that seemingly never stops.""

It's incumbent upon entrepreneurs to take care of themselves, he says.

""Managing that so that it doesn't eat you up and mess up your relationships is super hard,"" writes Wilson."

As the CEO of automaker Tesla and private space transport company SpaceX, founder of neurotechnology company Neuralink and tunneling company Boring Company, and a key figure in AI non-profit OpenAI, Musk is obviously extremely busy. He's also a billionaire and gets to play with ultra-cool high-tech toys, which sounds like a geek's dream come true.

But in reality, the good times are mixed with the bad, and the way Musk just described his life on Twitter, we're not sure many would trade places with him.

Answering a Twitter user's question about his ""amazing life,"" Musk said it consists of ""great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress.""

In another tweet, Musk took it even further. He was asked whether he was bipolar, and he flat out said ""yeah.""

Yeah — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2017

But in the next tweet, he said his condition might not medically be considered to be bipolar disorder.

Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2017

Finally, Musk summed up by implying that taking on so many stress-inducing responsibilities is his own fault.

If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2017

The painfully honest tweets come days after the official launch of Tesla's most affordable car — and likely the most important one — the Model 3.

During the launch event, Musk spoke about potential manufacturing problems, saying that the next six months will likely be ""hell.""

This is not the first time Musk has opened up about the problems that come with running so many high-profile endeavors at once.

During Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in June, he talked about his insane schedule and the steps he's taking to alleviate some of that dreadful stress, including drinking less coffee, sleeping more and allocating some time for dating."

It's safe to say Elon Musk is not afraid to think big.

The CEO of electric car maker Tesla and aeronautics firm SpaceX recently revealed details of a new endeavor: serving as chief executive of Neuralink, which is working to bring together computer tech with the human brain.

It's one of several bold ideas envisioned by Musk, when he's not working on self-driving electric cars or trying to outfit homes with solar panels. Here's a look at some of his big plans:

Using computers with your brain

The idea behind melding the human brain with computers surfaced during 2016's Code Conference, when he suggested artificial intelligence could advance to point where humans would be like house cats (so does that mean robots would share GIFs of us for humor?)

In April, Musk confirmed he would serve as CEO of Neuralink, a company working on a neural interface. The implant would work with the brain to augment its capabilities. Early uses of the product would go to people suffering from brain injuries tied to strokes or other ailments, said Musk, before being made available to the public.

Why everyone should be thinking about Mars

We could live there one day. Not only does Musk have a project for when humans will set foot on Mars (it's 2025), but he's already thought out details on colonizing.

How will Earthlings will be able to live on Mars? Musk says warming the planet up could melt its ice and create a more hospitable atmosphere. Ships traveling to Mars would be powered by a slush methane and would need 30 days to arrive. And no, it wouldn't have to be a one-way trip.

Not out of the question: Making pizza on the Red Planet.

CLOSE SpaceX has announced plans for a new system of rockets for taking astronauts to Mars. Newslook

The Hyperloop will zip you from LA to SF in 30 minutes

So it doesn't take 30 days to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco, but depending on how you try to make the trip, it can sure feel like it. By car, it can take roughly 6 hours, or between 1-2 hours by plane.

Musk's proposed Hyperloop transportation system would get travelers between the two California cities in 30 minutes, using magnetic levitation technology. Although Musk isn't working directly on this initiative, several companies, including Hyperloop One, are securing funding to bring the travel system to life. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Musk's SpaceX offered its services to 27 teams to attempt to build prototypes of pods used in a Hyperloop system.

CLOSE Hyperloop One demonstrated their proof of concept that may someday transport people and cargo in a vacuum tunnel at nearly the speed of sound.

Oh, and we could all be living in a computer simulation

Musk is not ruling out the possibility we're living in some form of The Matrix, where life is essentially a giant computer simulation. He cites improvements in video games from Pong to today, and suggests nearly lifelike graphics will make games “indistinguishable from reality.” It's a philosophical concept Musk thinks about a lot. “I've had so many simulation discussions, it's crazy.”

https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/20/technology/elon-musk-new-york-dc-hyperloop/index.html,pos,1.0,2.5156545993074357e-14,Elon Musk says he has 'verbal approval' to build New York-DC hyperloop,2017-07-20 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:46:17.973930,Jackie Wattles,"New York to DC in half an hour.

Elon Musk -- the serial entrepreneur who heads Tesla (TSLA), SpaceX and now The Boring Company -- says he ""just received verbal [government] approval"" to build a new underground hyperloop network that can shuttle commuters between the two cities, about 230 miles apart, in 29 minutes.

He made the announcement on Twitter, declaring his new super-fast transportation network will also have stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well as ""up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city.""

The announcement sparked lots questions: Musk didn't say what government official gave him a ""verbal"" OK for the project, and it's not clear that anyone would have the ability to sign off on such a project single handedly, much less verbally. Moreover, acquiring all the state and local permits necessary to build a hyperloop would undoubtedly be a complex, time consuming task.

Musk admitted as much later Thursday, tweeting that there's ""still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval.""

Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2017

When asked about Musk's tweets, a White House spokesperson said: ""We have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.""

The Department of Transportation declined to comment and referred questions to the White House.

The Boring Company -- the tunnel-digging firm that Musk launched earlier this year -- will apparently handle at least the digging portion of the project.

The company appeared to walk back Musk's declaration of ""verbal approval"" in a separate statement issued later Thursday, saying instead that the company has received ""verbal support"" from the government.

""The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials. With a few exceptions, feedback has been very positive,"" the statement reads, ""and we have received verbal support from key government decision-makers for tunneling plans, including a Hyperloop route from New York to Washington DC.""

The company added that it expects to cinch all the ""formal approvals necessary to break ground"" by the end of the year.

Even if the ultra-high speed rail does receive all the required approvals, it's not clear who would build the hyperloop rail system.

While the hyperloop is Musk's idea, he hasn't taken on the project personally. Rather, he challenged other inventors to create it -- and a couple of companies have cropped up to tackle the challenge, most notably, Hyperloop One.

Related: All the quirky details you need to know about Elon Musk's Boring company

The Boring Company was established by Musk earlier this year to build a web of traffic-beating tunnels under Los Angeles, through which cars can travel up to 130 miles per hour on metal skates.

So far, The Boring Company has spawned many puns, but not much progress in terms of reaching Musk's goal in L.A. The company has just one tunnel-digging machine, which Musk said was purchased ""second hand,"" and so far it's only dug a small distance beneath SpaceX-owned property in Hawthorne, California.

Musk's plan for the L.A. tunnel network is different than the hyperloop, which is a ultra high-speed raillway meant for long-distance traveling at much higher speeds.

But Musk said during a TED conference in April that his hyperloop idea dovetails nicely with his new tunnel-boring endeavor.

He mentioned an East Coast hyperloop at that conference, saying ""If you were to do something like a DC-to-New York hyperloop, I think you'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area.""

Musk added that his tunnel digging process wouldn't disturb people above ground.

""You're going under a lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel,"" he said.

For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2017

Musk also tweeted about even bigger ambitions to build a hyperloop between Los Angeles and San Francisco and another in Texas.

Both hyperloop and Musk's LA tunneling idea are longshots -- but Musk does have a flare for bringing the impossible to life.

There were plenty of naysayers when he announced plans to build a reusable rocket -- but SpaceX stunned the world in 2015 when it became the first to successfully guide a rocket to a safe landing after an orbital launch. The company has now done that more than a dozen times.

And earlier this year, Musk to his plans for reusing rockets a step further when he sent one back into space.

Still, even among entrepreneurs, Elon Musk's vacation track record--or lack thereof--is particularly spotty.

You sort of can't blame him. At PayPal in 2000, Musk was ousted and replaced with Peter Thiel by the company's board while he took his first vacation in years. Soon after, he contracted malaria and nearly died while visiting Brazil and his native South Africa.

Musk hasn't fared much better when he's tried to relax in more recent years. In 2015, he admitted he'd only taken two separate weeks off since founding SpaceX a dozen years earlier. During one of them, the company's rocket exploded. ""The lesson here,"" Musk joked, ""is don't take a week off.""

Still, he's tried again. Musk did enjoy some time away from Tesla and SpaceX earlier this year and, it seems, nothing went completely awry as a result.

If he can do it, so can you. Here are some things you can learn about how Musk takes vacations.

1. Build a team you're confident in.

It's hard to get away if you don't fully trust your team to pick up the slack when you're gone. How could you ever fully relax?

""My priority right now,"" Musk said in 2015, ""is to try to add some more management bench strength, to Tesla in particular, so that I can take a vacation."" Musk spent years building his companies and surrounding himself with people who could step in for him. Apparently, he's made headway: Since last year, he has taken trips to Miami, London, and Australia.

2. Do something with a high excitement factor.

If sitting on a beach means your mind will have time to wander, then take a different path: Do something thrilling. Musk went on vacation to England in 2015, and he didn't sit around--he went walking on the wings of a flying airplane. ""What could possibly go wrong?"" he wrote on Instagram. (He wore a harness.)

What you do doesn't have to be death-defying, but getting the adrenaline flowing could be a good way to distract yourself from work. It could even make you sharper: Researchers have found that experiencing new and novel things spurs the brain to be more creative and better at learning.

3. Completely unplug.

Musk has admitted Tesla nearly went bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis. Understandably, the entrepreneur wasn't keen on taking extended holidays in the years that followed. But even Musk appreciates the value of changing your scenery once in a while.

""After 2008 meltdown, vacation for me just meant email with a view,"" he tweeted in 2012, ""but SpaceX & Tesla are now strong enough that I can make it real (yay!!)"" If unplugging can elicit a ""yay!!"" from Elon Musk, then it's probably something you should try, too.

Elon Musk is launching a new company, and the idea sounds totally crazy. That sentence could have been written in 2002, when he founded SpaceX; in 2004, when he joined Tesla; or even in 1999, when he founded X.com. All three of those ventures sounded insane at the outset. All three, in different ways, led to tremendously successful businesses.

This time, we’re told, the concept may be his craziest yet. Confirming a Wall Street Journal report from last month, the explainer site Wait But Why on Thursday laid out Musk’s vision for a company called Neuralink whose goal is nothing less grandiose than to change the fundamental nature of human communication forever. Its plan is to embed computer chips in our brains that will eventually facilitate what Musk calls “consensual telepathy” between people. This could make possible an era in which people beam thoughts and images directly into one another’s minds, obviating the need for language. And that’s a good thing, Musk tells Wait But Why’s Tim Urban, because superintelligent A.I. is coming, and we’re going to need to be way smarter if we want to stop the machines from taking over the world and subjugating the human race. Whew!

If that sounds like science fiction, it really is. It’s fair to say that mainstream publications like the Wall Street Journal wouldn’t take this sort of thing seriously if it came from just about anyone but Musk, who has an unparalleled track record of turning the seemingly impossible into reality. Already skeptics have emerged to argue persuasively that Musk’s latest promise is unlikely to come true.

So why should we take it seriously? The answer lies in Musk’s approach to startups—not so much “think big, start small” as “think humongous, start big.”

In every case, Musk has set out to tackle what he believes to be one of humanity’s greatest problems, articulating a long-term strategy that involves a lot of speculation about the distant future. Yet in every case, he also has had a far more realistic, if still audacious, short- to medium-term plan that relies on technology that is just over the horizon, if not already available. Those are his real business plans.

In the case of Neuralink, Musk’s talk of telepathy and robot uprisings has dominated the early press coverage. But he once again has a much more plausible and much less sexy intermediate goal that you might have missed amid the more fanciful extremes of his lofty sales pitch—not to mention in media coverage both credulous and skeptical. Long before it tries to mess with any healthy person’s brain, Neuralink plans to develop a device to help treat people with serious brain injuries. As Musk tells Urban:

The first use of the technology will be to repair brain injuries as a result of stroke or cutting out a cancer lesion, where somebody’s fundamentally lost a certain cognitive element. It could help with people who are quadriplegics or paraplegics by providing a neural shunt from the motor cortex down to where the muscles are activated.

It’s understandable that this part of Musk’s plan has been reported as an afterthought. Musk himself framed it that way. But don’t be surprised if Neuralink 10 years from now is known not as the consensual-telepathy company, but as a leader in medical devices for the brain.

Think about Tesla and SpaceX, which we know today primarily as an electric-car company and an aerospace manufacturer. Tesla is a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of about $50 billion. SpaceX is private but has been valued at $15 billion. Both are prized for their growth potential, but they’re already serious, established businesses with tangible products and big revenue streams.

All of which makes it easy to forget that, 12 years ago, they sounded about as far-fetched as Neuralink does today.

Musk founded SpaceX with the modest goal of colonizing Mars and making human beings an interplanetary civilization, to hedge against the existential threat of a global extinction event. It’s the kind of startup idea that seems less likely to raise venture capital than to raise questions about its founder’s mental health.

But Musk differentiated early on between his short-, medium-, and long-range plans for the company. He didn’t start by drawing up plans for the Martian colonial government. Rather, he devoted the company’s first few years to figuring out how to build a functional rocket. Once he did that, his plan was to keep building better and cheaper spacecraft, with the stated aim of “revolutionizing the cost of space travel.” That’s still a big goal, but it’s hardly a crazy one. Importantly, it’s a goal that implies a legitimate business plan: to win government contracts for supply runs to the International Space Station. Having accomplished that, SpaceX is gearing up for its first manned space mission. It’s still a long way from colonizing Mars. But Musk and his SpaceX team will have accomplished a lot even if they never get there.

Musk’s early master plan for Tesla was only slightly less outlandish. At a time when electric cars had been written off by many as a technological dead end, the mere idea of an electric-car startup seemed quixotic. Yet Musk’s goal wasn’t just to build and sell electric vehicles.

The company’s overarching purpose, he wrote in a 2006 manifesto, was “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.” Got that? Tesla was a company founded to transform the economy and get the world off fossil fuels. Electric cars just happened to be the first step in that plan.

Again, Musk executed it methodically, in distinct stages. First, the company developed and built the motor for a high-performance electric sports car, using an existing model, the Lotus Elise. This was never going to be a big seller. But thanks to its novelty, it found a niche market among Silicon Valley tycoons and Hollywood celebrities. That laid the groundwork for the acclaimed Model S, a luxury sedan priced to compete with the likes of Mercedes and Audi, which in turn drove huge demand for Tesla’s first mass-market vehicle, the forthcoming Model 3. Now, with pre-orders pouring in, Tesla is branching out in several directions: developing self-driving cars, acquiring a solar power company, inventing products for home energy storage, and building the world’s largest electric-battery factory.

For all that, the “solar electric economy” that Musk envisioned more than a decade ago still seems remote. But Tesla has already driven us a good distance in that direction, and in the meantime, it’s a thriving business.

It’s still possible, of course, that SpaceX and Tesla will someday fulfill Musk’s original visions for them. Yet on the time scales we typically use to evaluate startups, it almost doesn’t matter. Musk sets his sights so high that he could fall far short and still emerge with a tremendously successful enterprise. For anyone else, these companies would constitute more than a life’s work.

The same is true of X.com, which Musk founded in 1999 with the goal of upending the banking system by building a full-service online financial institution. It soon merged with a competitor that was focused on allowing people to send money to each other on their Palm Pilots. That product, PayPal, became a hit, and Musk was eventually ousted and replaced PayPal’s creator, Peter Thiel. PayPal never became quite what Musk had in mind, yet it grew into a huge business and gave Musk the seed money to start SpaceX.

Viewed against this backdrop, Neuralink looks like a much different proposition than it might seem from the initial press reports. Sure, it’s conceivable that someday it will enable telepathy. And Musk might really view it as a new frontier in human communication and an essential weapon in the coming battle between humans and our robot would-be overlords. But that doesn’t mean anyone else has to look at it that way.

For all practical purposes, we can regard Musk’s long-term founding vision for his companies as akin to an origin myth—a tale he tells about them in order to imbue his ventures with a deeper meaning.

This serves multiple purposes. For Musk, it clarifies the problem he’s trying to solve and gives him a sense of purpose in addressing it. Crucially, it also inspires some of the brightest and most ambitious people in any given field to join him, because those kinds of people like to think they’re working on transformative, world-changing problems. One of the most underappreciated ingredients of Musk’s success has been his ability to attract engineers and designers brilliant enough to turn his whiteboard sketches into reality. Finally, it stirs up levels of hype that ensure Musk’s companies more publicity than they could ever gin up through conventional marketing strategies. (There’s a reason you don’t see a lot of Tesla commercials on TV.)

As a headline, “Musk Launches Medical Device Company to Treat Brain Injuries” doesn’t quite have the same ring as “Elon Musk Is Seriously Starting a Telepathy Company.” But chances are it will hold up better when we look back on it in a decade. Performing brain surgery on healthy people to augment their intelligence with A.I. may or may not be fantasy, but medical neural implants are not science fiction at all. These sorts of devices already exist in research labs around the world. What Musk is really doing, then, is attempting to commercialize the technology by making these chips much cheaper and more capable than they are today.

That in itself won’t be easy, as MIT Technology Review’s Antonio Regalado explains. Even if it works, it may not be a huge business, since the market is limited to people with brain conditions serious enough to justify the invasive implantation procedure. But it could certainly be a viable one. There weren’t exactly mainstream consumer markets for space rockets or $100,000 electric sports cars, either. If that works—if Neuralink becomes the leader in neural implants—then it’s not a stretch to think that a man as resourceful as Musk, working with some of the best scientists and engineers in the field, could develop all sorts of new applications for the technology over time, including but hardly limited to “consensual telepathy.” The initial gadgets would pay the bills while investors clamored to get in on the world’s hottest medical device company.

It’s possible, of course, that Neuralink will go nowhere. Most startups fail, after all. Musk himself has had some other heavily hyped ideas that have not so far led to stunning achievements. He famously proposed the Hyperloop, a hypothetical superspeed mass-transit system, but has so far avoided putting much of his own time or money into the idea. He also recently announced he’s starting a tunnel-boring concern, though its scale and ambitions remain unclear. Apparently he does have a filter, after all—and Neuralink passed through it.

There’s just one problem with ignoring the big story Musk tells whenever he starts a new company and focusing on the short-term business plan. The problem is that Tesla and SpaceX are still less than 15 years old—and Musk is still just 45. Today, it seems fair enough to say that they’re not really about ending fossil-fuel consumption and colonizing Mars, respectively. But give the man and his teams another decade or two, and maybe I’ll be the one who looks naïve for doubting that he was fulfilling his grand master plan all along."

The ads were paid for by a startup investor named Doug Derwin. The longtime Silicon Valley resident told CNNMoney he shelled out $400,000 to run ads in the Times and the Post, as well as the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury News.

It's the latest step in Derwin's $1 million bid to convince Musk he's failing environmentalists. He calls it ""Elon Dump Trump.""

Derwin said he didn't want to launch the campaign at first. Back in January, he was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his Tesla (TSLA) Model S electric car.

But as his Tesla was about to be delivered, Derwin said he caught wind of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's decision to walk away from Trump's business advisory council, which Kalanick served on with Musk. Kalanick had previously defended his working relationship with President Trump, but public pressure mounted in the wake of the president's immigration order.

""I didn't understand why there wasn't more public outcry against Musk,"" Derwin said Sunday.

Musk has defended his decision to stay on the advisory council. He said on Twitter in February that his position ""does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration.""

Musk also said that by keeping a seat at the table, he is ""engaging on critical issues"" that ""will on balance serve the greater good.""

Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017

But Derwin said that he couldn't believe Musk hadn't done more to lambast Scott Pruitt, Trump's pick for head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has said he does not believe that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming.

Derwin said he canceled his Tesla order -- eating the cost of his $2,500 deposit -- and donated the $150,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.

The ACLU did not immediately return a request for comment.

The letter is Derwin's latest attempt to get Musk's attention. He said he earlier bought a billboard near Tesla's headquarters in Palo Alto and hired ad vehicles to cart around his message.

And he launched a website and Twitter account last week to garner even more attention.

The Sunday advertisement pleads with Musk to push back more vocally against Trump, who Derwin calls ""a disaster for the fight against climate change.""

""You aren't accomplishing anything"" on the White House advisory boards, the letter reads. It adds that Musk's ""implied support for Trump is strengthening his ability to enact his agenda.""

There's an open letter to Elon Musk in today's NYTimes urging him to ""dump Trump."" pic.twitter.com/AKrIiYfDMC — Seth Fiegerman (@sfiegerman) April 23, 2017

Tesla fired back at Derwin's campaign on Sunday. In a statement to CNNMoney, Musk's electric car company called it ""quite ironic"" that Musk is being attacked about environmental issues.

""Tesla's entire reason for existing is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy,"" the statement said. ""If someone wants to spend money to promote a pro-environment objective, we can think of better ways to do that than attacking the people who are most committed to that very purpose.""

Derwin said he's funding his efforts with money he netted during the massive stock market rally after Trump's election victory. He called it ""blood money.""

""It bothered me to say I just made X amount of dollars, and I made it because of Donald Trump,"" he said.

And the tech investor claims to have another $1 million at the ready. He said he wants to donate it to the charity of Musk's choice -- but he'll only do that if Musk speaks up.

""He doesn't even have to resign from the board, just decry Trump climate change policies,"" Derwin said.

He also wants Musk to wear some ""resist"" paraphernalia -- the hallmark of the anti-Trump movement."

During a speech at a TED Talks conference, Musk -- the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO -- unveiled what he hopes to accomplish with his latest venture, The Boring Company.

A new video shows a computer-generated mockup of a sprawling network of underground tunnels that vehicles can access via elevators nested near roadsides.

Once underground, the video shows futuristic silver platforms whisking the cars toward their destinations.

Musk first introduced the world to his tunnel idea in December, when he got caught in one of Los Angeles's notorious traffic jams. Frustrated, he sent out a tweet promising to buy a tunnel boring machine and ""just start digging.""

Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 17, 2016

It wasn't clear how serious he was. Then in January Musk raised eyebrows when he announced that he's already made exciting progress and he plans to start digging within a few months.

Now it looks like The Boring Company has its first piece of physical hardware. Musk tweeted out an image of a tunnel digging machine sporting The Boring Company logo on Friday.

Though a functioning web of underground highways is undoubtedly a distant dream, Musk is known for taking seemingly impossible ideas and turning them into reality.

With Tesla, Musk achieved something that many doubted was possible -- he built a successful car startup that could compete with Detroit manufacturers. In fact, Tesla recently became the most valuable car manufacturer in America.

Musk's company SpaceX also achieved a historic feat last month when it launched and landed a rocket from orbital space for a second time. Reusing rockets is a major step forward in making spaceflight more affordable, since they cost tens of millions of dollars and have traditionally been discarded after one launch.

Musk will need to pull off a similar cost-crunching endeavor to make his tunnel dream a reality. Tunneling, like space travel, is typically very expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars per mile.

Musk is now worth more than $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, but it could have worked out very differently. In fact, a crucial decision Elon Musk was forced to make in 2010 when, by his own account, the billionaire was broke, is one of the reasons Musk has been able to cash in on Tesla's rapid share rise this year: Musk held on to shares at the very moment when a sale to raise cash would have made financial sense. Musk, who had $200 million in cash at one point, invested ""his last cent in his businesses"" and said in a 2010 divorce proceeding, ""About four months ago, I ran out of cash."" Musk told the New York Times' DealBook at that time, ""I could have either done a rushed private stock sale or borrowed money from friends."" It's a dilemma that many entrepreneurs face, but there is a big difference between the options available to Musk and the options available to most business owners. Musk was able to live on $200,000 a month in loans from billionaire friends — while still flying in a private jet — rather than sell any of his Tesla stake. Though the root of the problem is the same: intangible assets or, in other words, a business owner who is ""asset rich"" and ""cash poor."" And it can lead business owners to the most difficult decision of all: having to sell a piece or even all of their company.

This is not a problem limited to founders of technology start-ups based in California. ""It's really one of those tough scenarios with no good answers,"" said Richard Stumpf, CFP and managing partner of Wichita, Kansas-based Financial Benefits. Stumpf has worked with farmers in this situation, and sometimes for reasons that are similar to what drove Musk to admit he was broke: divorce. ""It happens all the time here,"" he said. ""Farming 2,000 acres ... asset-rich, cash-poor. And the options are limited, quite frankly."" Even if you have friends as nice as Elon's, borrowing money can cause problems. Years ago a friend of Stumpf's, who owned a heavy road construction company, got into a bind and borrowed money from buddies. He eventually paid them back, but got behind and risked ruining relationships. In the end the business survived better than his strained friendships. Even for business owners with collateral to back the loan, the cash flow needs to be coming in to meet debt payments. And in many cases lenders are picky about asset types they will accept. Intangible assets are not the type of collateral that a typical commercial lender will accept, said Andrew Sherman, partner at Seyfarth Shaw, who has worked with companies at all stages of development. ""The bank is in the business of collecting interest, not foreclosing on collateral,"" Stumpf said. ""Selling the business or some of the ground that you don't want to sell can be the only way to survive,"" he said. This can be a good problem for business owners who have contracts lined up that will create significant cash flow but for which expansion is first needed. But selling equity to fund expansion is often a dreaded decision — and for good reason. ""You don't want to go the way of angel investors, because you know you're giving away a whole lot more than you're getting,"" Stumpf said. ""In a fast-growing business, you sell 10 percent for cash to make it continue to grow, but when you're growing 30 percent to 40 percent a year, that's a heck of a return on capital"" being given to someone else. ""It's a shame when that happens with a viable business,"" Stumpf added.

In a fast-growing business, you sell 10 percent for cash to make it continue to grow, but when you're growing 30 percent to 40 percent a year, that's a heck of a return on capital. It's a shame when that happens with a viable business. Richard Stumpf managing partner of Financial Benefits

Sherman said many entrepreneurs need to turn to the equity markets to solve cash flow problems, reaching out to angels, angel networks, online funding or private placements, especially when they lack real estate or inventory or equipment to pledge as collateral. In the short term it can be attractive, since it does not need to be paid back, but in the medium and long run it can be ""a very costly source of capital"" for a business that is growing and can expect its equity to increase in value, Sherman said. One hybrid strategy is to partner with an angel for a bank loan, where the angel provides a guaranty with its personal balance sheet to secure the loan and receives equity or warrants in return. The business owner is still giving up equity, but far less equity than in a straight sale, since the risk to the investor is much lower, Sherman said. There is an operating principle of entrepreneurship that makes it likely that business founders will face this situation at some point in a company's development. Owners plow profits back into a business, and the business itself is often 80 percent to 90 percent of their net worth, Stumpf estimated. In a fast-growth business, retained earnings should be low because the owner is reinvesting in the business. ""They will do whatever they can to keep the business alive,"" Stumpf said. His prime example is himself. ""What I took out of paycheck in the first few years was insignificant. I was buying new computers or subscribing to information services or doing marketing programs. I don't have a million dollars' worth of a factory behind me, but I was still doing same thing — reinvesting in the business rather than taking big paychecks home."" More from iCONIC:

Jack Bogle's advice for millennials

The business letters Warren Buffett loves to read

America's most successful food trucks As CEO and co-founder of small-business finance company Biz2Credit, Rohit Arora has a lot of experience with business founders facing the decision to sell as a result of early success. Owners of quickly growing business are barely paying themselves and can only withstand so much of a lack of equity in the business before it becomes a cash flow challenge. ""While you're doing great on paper, just to keep operating at the expanding scale, we have seen owners have to get an equity infusion,"" Arora said. Entrepreneurs can raise money in the debt market, but after a certain point debt gets very expensive. ""It's a classic mousetrap,"" Arora said. ""A growing business that looks good and there's lots of money going in and out, plenty of cash flow, but any time there is a hiccup, all the cash flow gets sucked up."" One of Arora's clients, an entrepreneur in his 30s who rapidly grew a series of franchised smartphone stories in New York City, borrowed often from the Biz2Credit platform as the business grew to 50 stores over four years. The expansion was so swift that it turned into an asset-rich, cash-poor situation, with the entrepreneur needing more money to run the 50 stores, and for reasons from payroll to stocking expensive smartphones. The notorious Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fire recall put this owner in an immediate cash crunch — he had to wait three to four months for compensation from Samsung. He really only had two options: Sell a stake or sell the entire operation. He ended up doing both, initially selling a stake but ultimately selling the entire business to a large distributor of phone accessories who was keen to reach customers directly. ""I've seen it so many times,"" Arora said. ""He needed to give up equity, and once he got it, it stabilized the company. But as an entrepreneur, it was difficult working for someone else. He decided it was better to get totally out."" ""In any high-growth business, I don't think you can do anything much different to avoid it,"" Arora said, though he does suggest that geographic expansion beyond an existing successful footprint be considered with caution. For entrepreneurs, the good news is that there's always another business to create with the proceeds from a sale. The smartphone store entrepreneur could have sold to a bigger chain or even at a higher price if his hand hadn't been forced, Arora said. But he made good money and is now back with several new businesses, including one in the smartphone accessories market. He took what he learned about selling accessories and doing smartphone repairs to the online world, where margins and volume are higher. And instead of lamenting the loss of physical stores, the entrepreneur has eliminated the risk of a cash crunch associated with retail locations."

US entrepreneur Elon Musk has outlined his vision for a tunnel network under Los Angeles and shown how it might work.

Mr Musk also told the Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference he planned fully autonomous journeys across the US by the end of the year.

He spoke about how he wanted solar-powered roof tiles to be standard on ""every home"" within 50 years.

And he explained why he is committed to sending a rocket to Mars.

In a wide-ranging conversation with Ted curator Chris Anderson, the founder of Tesla and Space X said that he was inspired to consider a tunnel system to alleviate congestion because he found being stuck in traffic ""soul-destroying"".

Image copyright Screenshot Image caption Cars would mount a platform

He showed off a concept video of how the multi-layered tunnel system might work.

Cars would stop on a trolley-like device and the ground would open up to carry them below. Cars would then drive off the platform and another would get on to be returned above ground.

Image copyright Screenshot Image caption The platform would take the car underground

He said that his vision was to have ""no limits"" to the amount of tunnels, but to find ways to cut the cost of boring and to speed up how quickly such tunnels could be created.

""We have a pet snail called Gary, and Gary is capable of moving 14 times faster than a tunnel boring machine - so the ambition is to beat Gary,"" he said.

The firm he set up to oversee the project - The Boring Company - took up less than 3% of his time, he said, and it was run by interns and part-timers.

""It is pottering along.""

Susan Beardslee, a senior analyst at ABI Research, said the project sounded like a ""moonshot"".

""He has shown his ability to be a visionary, and I believe he can take tunnelling and apply the financial capital and technical expertise, but this is not a go-it-alone project.

""He is addressing the need to look at congestion - but it will have to be a public/private partnership,"" she said.

""Musk is good at coming up with a very different way of looking at things, and this might work better somewhere where it can be purpose-built rather than retro-fitted.""

Mr Musk is rarely out of the headlines these days - recently notching up another landmark for his Space X business when it launched a recycled rocket as well as starting a new firm - NeuraLink - that would aim to augment the human brain with computer technology.

His semi-autonomous Tesla car fleet has been under scrutiny since a fatal crash in May 2016, but Mr Musk showed no signs of slowing down his ambitions for the firm.

He promised a ""fully autonomous"" journey across the US ""by the end of the year"".

Image copyright Screenshot Image caption In a chat with Ted curator Chris Anderson, Mr Musk said he wanted to think about the future and not be sad

""From a parking lot in California, cross-country to New York or from Seattle to Florida, these cars should be able to go anywhere on the highway system,"" he said.

He also revealed that he had test-driven the semi-autonomous electric truck Tesla plans to unveil in September, saying it was ""so nimble"".

""You will drive it around like a sports car,"" he said.

""In a tug-of-war between a Tesla semi and a diesel semi, the Tesla would pull the diesel uphill.""

Ted curator Chris Anderson asked Mr Musk why he had so many diverse interests - on Earth and in Space.

""The value of Tesla is to accelerate the inevitable use of sustainable energy and if it accelerates that by a decade, then that would be a fundamental aspiration,"" said Mr Musk.

But, he added, the advancement of space technology was not inevitable and would only happen if someone worked hard to make it a reality.

""It is important to have an inspiring future and if it doesn't include being out there among the stars, that is incredibly depressing.

""I am not trying to be anyone's saviour.

""I just want to think about the future and not feel sad."""

Musk, who started digging a big hole on the SpaceX campus near Los Angeles earlier this year, proposes using these underground roadways as a new kind of highway system. He pitched this idea Friday morning at TED, where extreme wealth meets extreme optimism in the power of technology to solve all the world's ills.

As the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla tells it, the cars of tomorrow will reach these tunnels from street-level elevators dotted around the city. Rather than navigate these tunnels under their own power, they would ride on electric trolleys not unlike slot cars, at speeds reaching 124 mph. Musk says such a system would whisk you from LA's Westwood neighborhood to Los Angeles International Airport in just 5 minutes—a 10-mile drive that typically requires a 30 to 60-minute slog down the 405 freeway.

""We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3-D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion,"" Musk said from the stage at TED. Now before you argue that a few tunnels won't help traffic in LA, or San Francisco, or Mumbai, or anywhere else, please know that Musk is not talking about a few tunnels. ""There's no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have,"" he says.

Now you're surely thinking, ""What about induced demand?,"" the idea that if you build it, commuters will fill it. Musk's reply? Build as many as 40 layers of underground streets and you can clear up any amount of congestion. And he promises that using more efficient boring machines to create narrower tunnels will make tunneling orders of magnitude cheaper.

It's an appealing vision, held back only by its lunacy.

""I would put what Mr. Musk is saying today in the bullshit category,"" says Thom Neff, a civil engineer who runs consulting company OckhamKonsult.

Any number of recent projects show just how crazy this idea is. The Big Dig in Boston. The fourth bore of the Caldecott Tunnel near San Francisco. SR-99 in Seattle. The list of epic projects that have consumed years of time and piles of money is long indeed. Why? Because digging underground is a slow, complex business. The crews doing such work must work through soil and rock that changes from one spot to the next, keep immensely complex machines running, navigate existing underground infrastructure like utility lines, and keep everyone safe in the process. ""The idea of Musk thinking he can have this magic machine and go in there full bore, it's not gonna happen,"" Neff says.

Frankly, people who actually understand civil engineering find the idea of building a network of highways below cities hard to fathom. It would require ""at least decades and possibly on the order of a century, plus a lot of uncertainty, a lot of risk,"" says Henry Petroski, a Duke University civil engineer. Plus, it distracts from other, more practical proposals, like carpooling, bus rapid transit, better subway systems, and telecommuting.

Of course, Musk has a track record of quieting naysayers: He's made electric cars cool, sent rockets to space, and convinced at least a few people that hyperloop is a good idea. But this latest vision goes too far. After discussing tunneling, the Tesla Model 3, autonomous driving, voyages to Mars, and solar energy, Musk concluded his TED interview by saying, ""You'll tell me if it ever starts getting genuinely insane, right?""

Ummm..."

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors love CEO Elon Musk. Musk is a visionary genius and entrepreneurial billionaire who is often compared to ""Iron Man"" superhero protagonist Tony Stark. But while Musk fans are excited by his insatiable thirst for innovative technology, Tesla investors may be getting uneasy about his growing number of outside commitments.

Ironically, the visionary engineering genius that Musk named his electric car company after was eventually driven to financial ruin by his pursuit of technology. Tesla investors are hoping to avoid the same fate.

Musk's track record of success is impressive. He famously dropped out of Stanford University during his freshman year to found online city guide software company Zip2. Four years later, Musk sold Zip2 to AltaVista for more than $300 million.

Without missing a beat, Musk founded online payment company X.com, which later merged with PayPal Holdings (PYPL). EBay (EBAY) purchased PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion before spinning it off in 2015.

Now, of course, Musk's primary world-changing objective is a complete overhaul of the global auto industry. Musk wants Tesla's electric, affordable Model 3 to replace the internal combustion engine vehicles that have defined the auto industry since its inception. The only problem is that Tesla rivals Ford Motor Co. (F) and General Motors Co. (GM) are pillars of American industry. For a startup to steal market share from such established giants is a very tall order, especially when both Ford and GM are working around the clock to innovate themselves.

Obviously Musk is fearless and extremely business-savvy, as his track record demonstrates. However, in addition to changing the world with Tesla, Musk is also attempting to change the world with an ever-growing number of new startups. Musk is also CEO of space travel company SpaceX. Musk is the brains behind the tube travel transportation proposal known as Hyperloop. Musk is also a founder of nonprofit artificial intelligence research company OpenAI. Within the past year, Musk founded two more companies – The Boring Company for advanced transportation tunneling and Neuralink for developing brain-computer interface technology.

Clearly, Musk is not a one-trick pony and has more to offer the human race than an affordable electric car. However, one of the best examples of the dangers associated with the risk of relentlessly pursuing technology is visionary engineering genius Nikola Tesla.

""Elon Musk is a brilliant visionary and is currently one of the greatest technological innovation entrepreneurs in the world,"" says Rose Faghih, assistant professor for the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering. ""Tesla was a brilliant innovator and creative genius whose extraordinary technical depth and vision revolutionized the field of electrical engineering.""

In the late 1800s, Tesla invented an alternating-current power system that the world still uses to power electrical devices to this day. Tesla also contributed groundbreaking ideas in the fields of radar, X-ray and remote control technology, as well as rotating magnetic field science.

Unfortunately, it was Tesla's obsession with wireless communication and power transmission that led to his downfall. Tesla had a vision for a global network of devices that could wirelessly transmit information and electricity from place to place around the world. Obviously, Tesla's vision was extraordinarily accurate and is the basis for cell phones and other wireless devices we use every day. But in 1900, the technology was simply not advanced enough for Tesla to realize his vision. He eventually declared bankruptcy after years of failed attempts to develop his idea.

Tesla investors are hoping Musk can deliver an inexpensive electric car that can compete with Ford and GM. At the same time, Musk is developing implant technology to facilitate the upload and download of online information from a computer directly to people's brains. While Faghih says direct comparisons between Elon Musk and Nikola Tesla are difficult to make given the two men were born more than a century apart, it's understandable for Tesla shareholders to be concerned about the direction Musk's vision is leading him. At the very least, Tesla investors must read a seemingly constant flow of headlines about new Elon Musk side projects during the most critical period in Tesla's history.

According to JJ Kinahan, managing director of client advocacy and market structure for TD Ameritrade, shareholders of any company are right to be concerned about a potentially distracted CEO, but they should also keep in mind that side projects may actually be more relevant than they originally seem.

""I believe that in any venture, the more a person's attention is divided, the harder it is to focus narrowly. However, in situations where the companies' technology and target audiences are highly correlated, there may actually be some economies of scale in the CEO overseeing multiple companies,"" Kinahan says.

For example, Musk's involvement with solar power company SolarCity may have initially seemed irrelevant to Tesla investors until Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016.

Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for Convergex Group, says investors should care about their CEO's side projects, but wealthy CEOs may not be as involved in the side projects as they seem.

""This isn't a normal person picking up a part-time job. They have support to do it, and, properly executed, it should not be a hindrance to their publicly-held business,"" Colas says.

Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo says Tesla investors shouldn't overlook Musk's word-class Tesla staff, as well.

""There's always a question that could turn into a concern over whether or not Musk is spreading himself too thin,"" Kallo says. ""The one thing that gives us a little bit of peace of mind regarding all of his projects and him losing focus is that he has a deep bench of teammates at Tesla. That's one thing that's probably underestimated at Tesla is their ability to recruit top-level talent.""

Part of effective leadership is the ability to delegate responsibility, and Musk has certainly earned the trust of investors up to this point with his past success.

There is no denying that both Elon Musk and Nikola Tesla are rare visionaries whose technology will leave a lasting impact on the world. Tesla investors are simply hoping that Musk's insatiable drive to pursue futuristic technology won't lead Tesla investors down Nikola Tesla's financial path."

The story ""is total nonsense,"" says Musk, who commented on Thursday.

Vance wrote that when Musk's assistant of 12 years, Mary Beth Brown, asked for a raise, Musk told her to take two weeks off. Musk took on Brown's duties, so the story goes, and when she returned from vacation, Musk let her go because he realized he didn't need her.

Business Insider painted the anecdote as ""an important career lesson. "" Entrepreneur picked up the story, too. And Fortune promoted the Business Insider story on its Facebook page.

The CEO of Tesla and Space X categorically refuted the story in a string of tweets.

""Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors and never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so. Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense.

Does he pull his curtains back, look out the window and see a world of Isaac Asimov flying cars, with Robert Heinlein rockets headed to Mars, and Arthur C. Clarke artificial intelligence menaces?

Musk’s sci-fi visions are a large part of his mystique. His latest Tony Stark-esque conception came in a tweet last month:

New York to Washington in 29 minutes certainly would be a game changer, but there’s something more pedestrian going on here, too. Musk likes to portray himself as an engineer and a dreamer—that’s what underlies the Hyperloop talk—but his real business play is taking on the exorbitantly high cost of infrastructure in the US.

Consider: New York City’s newest subway line, the Second Avenue extension in Manhattan, hums along underground at 15.4 miles per hour, or about 22.6 feet a second. And in each second of your luxurious $2.50 ride under the Big Apple, you cruise past $518,160-worth of tunnel.

That’s not a typo. Each one of the two miles of extension cost an astounding $2.73 billion. Tunnels are never cheap, but per mile the new subway line is the most expensive in the world. For comparison, digging all the way across the English Channel, a full 23.5 miles, cost around $30 billion in today’s dollars, or $1.3 billion per mile. Madrid managed to complete a subway expansion in 1999-2003 for a mere $104 million a mile (although it was not all underground).

The high cost of tunneling under America

Building tunnels in the US is more expensive than anywhere else in the world by a huge margin. (Although Australia isn’t cheap either.) For the majority of us that might at most be an interesting fact for some truly lame cocktail party conversation, but if you’re a billionaire industrialist, a cost differential of 10x between industrialized countries for a basic service smells like money. Which is why Elon Musk is currently dreaming about ways to build tunnels under LA.

The Boring Company arrived in April, launching with a video announcement on YouTube. The short clip showed a car (a Tesla, of course) darting through Los Angeles traffic, only to pull into what looks like an oversized window-washing cart, which is then sucked into an underground tunnel, and whisked to its final destination, unimpeded by gas-consuming dinosaurs.

Musk’s electric sleds are the vision part of his transportation-business plan—something that looks like a Jetson’s-level technological advance and would probably blow away a potential investor. But the real engine of this project, the place where Musk can actually make a ton of money, is in figuring out how to reduce the bloated cost of digging a tunnel in the US. If someone could figure out how to dig a tunnel in the US at the same cost they can do it anywhere else in the world, they’d make a fortune, and win contracts for any tunnel project in the country.

This is the exact type of market inefficiency that investors and hedge fund operators look for. If, for example, investors notice that oil costs 10 times more in Canada than anywhere else in the world, they’ll see it as a safe bet that oil there is overpriced, and will fall in the long run. But most of those bets are just that—a gamble on something outside investors’ control. It’s rare to have the gravitas and resources to actually change how a market or an industry works, like actually repricing the oil in Canada. And that’s what Musk hopes to do to tunnel digging in the US.

One reason tunnel digging in the US is so pricey is that labor costs there are much higher than in most other parts of the world. Productivity is also higher in the US, and major strides are being made on making burrowing machinery more efficient; Musk has talked about increasing the power of drilling machines and automating tunnel reinforcements, all of which would increase speed.

But to be successful, Musk doesn’t have to do any of that. He merely has to avoid what is actually causing the exorbitant costs in the US market: a combination of how few drilling companies there are in America, the inefficiencies of governments (the only real buyers when it comes to tunnels), expensive union contracts, and onerous governmental regulations.

Musk has already done this once, to massive success.

Rocketing out of inefficiency

Musk has said that SpaceX, his rocket company, was born when he was personally exploring how to send a miniature greenhouse to Mars on his own dime and found it prohibitively expensive. It would be cheaper, he decided, to build his own rocket. There’s no reason to doubt that’s part of the story, and there is real innovation now coming out of SpaceX; they had to build their own engines and rockets and there’s the promise that their larger and reusable rockets will greatly reduce the cost of getting something to orbit.

But for now that’s just the jazz hands overtop the real footwork.

Musk actually found millions of dollars in value in breaking into the US spy-satellite business and overturning a massive market inefficiency: For almost a decade there was only one US company in the military-rocket game, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing called United Launch Alliance. Every top-secret government project had to use United Launch Alliance, because it was the only company with top-secret clearance. As might be expected when there’s only one bidder on must-do government projects, the cost for the US to launch top-secret satellites has for years been higher than it was for the rest of the world.

Then SpaceX entered the market, and after a decade of being the only ride in town, United Launch Alliance began to falter. It struggled to match SpaceX’s prices for military contracts, and even dropped out of some bids. SpaceX delivers other payloads too, of course, but government contracts are the largest share of their business. It’s a classic tale of what happens to a monopoly when it meets a freer market—and a story in which SpaceX is poised to reap millions.

A backroad to auto success

Musk’s biggest bet, Tesla, also seems like a play against market stagnation, although in this case not necessarily the type that can be pinned on government. In 2003—the year Tesla launched—the American auto industry was the envy of the industrial world. But it was also bloated and stale, managing old factories and organized labor. Back in 2003, GM, which would require a bailout in 2008, was still making money, but its pension costs were about to balloon, to around between $900 and $1,300 per car in 2012. And, aside from tinkering in the early 1990s, the auto industry largely ignored electric.

Musk saw an untapped niche in electric cars, a cool technology that Detroit wasn’t limber enough to pivot into. Aside from some glorified golf carts, the hybrid-electric car history started with the Tesla Roadster in 2008. Since, Tesla has had a long run virtually unopposed in building electric cars, factories and charging networks. (Although, as Ford and GM have shown recently, old-auto may be catching up in the electric game. A big battleship may take a while to turn, but when it does, look out.)

Recently, a video of Musk surfaced and made the internet rounds. It shows him taking delivery of a McLaren F1 that cost $800,000 in 1999, his present to himself for selling his first venture, Zip2. Musk is happy about his new car, but what he’s really excited about is his next venture: X.com, a finance company that later merged with PayPal. Listening to Musk, you hear hints that in 1999 he saw finance as a stale market ready to be disrupted with internet technology. Standing in front of an ATM, he says, “we’re going to transform the traditional banking industry.”

For Musk, the market niche is the true basis of innovation. Yes, patents and inventions follow, but the initial insight is finding an industry that is moving too slow, or is impervious to change, often because government and industry have colluded to make it that way. When it comes to running a business, Musk is more Andrew Carnegie than Nikola Tesla.

A tunnel may seem a strange place to find an internet billionaire or a space magnate. But with billions to spend on equipment and engineers, Musk has the chance to take on another slow-moving eddy in the stream of capitalism. If he could cut the cost of digging a tunnel in the US by even a fraction, using what is working in overseas drilling, he could find himself in control of another market niche."

Ashlee Vance shared the anecdote in his biography of Musk, "" Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,"" published in May 2015.

According to Vance, Brown asked Musk for a significant raise after working for him for more than a decade. In response, Musk told Brown to take two weeks off, during which he would assume her responsibilities and see whether she was critical to his success, the book says.

When Brown returned, Musk told her he didn't need her anymore, according to the book's account.

Musk took issue with that.

When people think of Elon Musk, they probably think of someone with a clear vision of the future. If his actions and businesses are anything to go by, Musk is working towards a tomorrow in which electricity is plentiful and readily available, carbon dioxide emissions are at an all-time low, and humanity is on the verge of living on other planets.

Between Tesla, Hyperloop, and The Boring Company, Musk has taken steps to combat climate change and global warming by revolutionizing the ways that people travel, and what they use to get around. The Hyperloop is, essentially, a high-speed bullet train, the Boring Company has been tasked with creating an underground electric highway, and Tesla is improving high-efficiency electric cars.

It should go without saying, then, that Musk is very aware of the dangerous realities of climate change.

“Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI,” Musk said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I keep telling people this. I hate to be Cassandra here, but it’s all fun and games until somebody loses a fucking eye. This view [of climate change] is shared by almost everyone who’s not crazy in the scientific community.”

Musk’s opinions on climate change shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Tesla’s vehicles — arguably their flagship products — run on electricity; and they’ve launched everything from sedans to semi trucks and service vans. The company also sells solar panel roofs and batteries capable of storing large amounts of electricity generated from solar power.

In the past, Musk himself has called the act of denying climate change “fraud,” and has told people, albeit jokingly, to use a thermometer if they’re unsure of the existence of global warming. Musk has never shied away from acting against the dangers that threaten the future of humanity and planet Earth.

Keeping An Eye on AI

If you’ve read anything about Elon Musk within the past year, you know that he’s also wary of artificial intelligence (AI), as proven by him noting how AI is just as dangerous as the changing weather.

Like climate change, Musk has warned people time and time again of the threat AI poses to society, He believes that AI is capable of outperforming its creators, and leaving such technology unchecked will be a costly mistake. He’s urged governors to place restrictions on AI before it’s too late, and helped launch OpenAI to facilitate the development of safe, ethical AI.

Despite this, however, Rolling Stone reported Musk saying there’s maybe “a five to 10 percent chance of success” of creating safe AI. That’s before you factor in Google’s DeepMind and its AI projects like AlphaGo Zero. DeepMind, by the way, is something Musk invested in so he could keep an eye on their AI development.

“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” Musk explained to Rolling Stone. “There’s a lot of risk in concentration of power. So if AGI [artificial general intelligence] represents an extreme level of power, should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?”

Multiple AI researchers have publicly disagreed with Musk’s statements on AI, but it remains to be seen if Musk’s suspicions about AI will become reality. He is probably right that AI’s will be able to best humans at anything by 2030. DeepMind’s AlphaGo AI has already beaten multiple Go champions since its creation, and it’s only gotten better — it’s now even able to teach itself."

See if this sounds familiar: An Elon Musk-founded company strikes on an idea ahead of its time and rises to prominence by revolutionizing a basic service. But it's Musk's original small business, and it's one you may have never heard of: Zip2. Before all the companies with which Musk has become synonymous, from The Boring Company and SpaceX to Tesla and PayPal, there was Zip2, an early online directory that helped users find nearby businesses and provide turn-by-turn directions from a set origin, and allowed small businesses to establish an online presence — all in 1995. Zip2 struck landmark deals with media companies including The New York Times — which were anxious to understand the new thing called the internet. Zip2 was acquired in 1999 by Compaq for more than $300 million. With all Musk has ventured into since, it's hard to believe his first fortune came by creating an online Yellow Pages. But as a Musk biographer notes of the idea, ""Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that everyone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza parlor and the turn-by turn directions to get there. This may seem obvious today — think Yelp meets Google Maps — but back then not even stoners had dreamed up such a service."" Zip2 provided the young, unknown entrepreneur with ways to test his big ideas and bold management style on the fly. Here are 7 lessons from Musk's first business success.

1. Find your big idea — or ideas — early.

NASA

When he was in college, Musk developed his short list of game-changers: in addition to the Internet, the production and consumption of sustainable energy and space exploration. ""Those were the areas that I thought would most affect the future,"" Musk said in a 2012 video interview with tech entrepreneur and podcast host Kevin Rose. ""I was fortunate enough to be involved in those areas. It's kinda my best guess at what would most likely affect the future in the biggest way."" Surprisingly, Musk didn't see an entrepreneurial path in his future. ""In '95, I kinda thought the Internet would be something that would change the world in a major way, and I wanted to be a part of it,"" Musk said in the interview. ""I wouldn't actually try to start a company, I'd try to get a job at Netscape."" When Netscape did not respond to his application, he even tried waiting in the lobby until he became so embarrassed he left. Musk did pretty quickly display an entrepreneurial knack for selling ideas. ""Musk built a huge case around a standard PC and lugged the unit onto a base with wheels. When prospective investors would come by, Musk would put on a show and roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a mini-supercomputer,"" an effort that an early Zip2 employee told journalist Ashlee Vance for his biography, ""Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.""

2. Rely less on business gurus and their books and more on biographies.

A lifelong avid reader — including of comic books — Musk relies on reading for historical context. What he doesn't read are business best-sellers. ""I don't read many general business books,"" Musk said in the Foundation 20 interview. In fact, Musk said he never had a business mentor, but would look for feedback from the people around him and ""feedback from the historical context"" — books, in other words. He prefers books about scientists, engineers, and of course, entrepreneurs like himself. ""I like Franklin's autobiography and a recent written biography on Franklin,"" Musk said, referring to U.S. statesman and historical figure Benjamin Franklin.

""I decided to go on deferment,"" Musk said in the podcast with Kevin Rose about his decision to not attend Stanford University for a graduate degree after gaining admission. ""I was just writing software that summer and it got to the start of the quarter at Stanford. I figured if I start a company and it doesn't work, then I can always go back and graduate school."" The department chairman told him he probably wasn't going to hear from Musk again. ""He was correct,"" Musk said. ""I've never spoken to him since.""

4. Be prepared to make sacrifices.

The original Zip2 office was studio-sized (20 feet by 30 feet), in a building lacking elevators and reliable toilets. The office Internet connection was provided by Musk drilling a hole in the drywall near the Zip2 door and then stringing an ethernet cable down the stairwell to the ISP of an Internet-business below Zip2's office. Musk and his brother, Kimbal, a Zip2 co-founder, kept their clothes in a small closet and showered at the YMCA, according to Vance's biography. The Musk brothers took meals (sometimes four a day) at the local Jack in the Box. Elon was prone to sleep in the office on a beanbag next to his desk and asked employees to kick him awake when they came in so he could get back to coding. When an intern borrowed their car, the wheels literally came off along the way, cutting a groove into the pavement. If you're in business for the first time, buckle up — you better be in it for the long haul.

5. Be aware that being obsessive isn't the same as being a good manager.

Even when the Musk brothers and their team couldn't sell anyone on Zip2's actual product, one way the sales team's confidence was kept up was through seeing the continual improvements Musk was making to the software. But Elon was less good at managing staffers, especially when it came to giving criticism. ""You would see people come out of the meetings with this disgusted look on their face,"" A Zip2 salesman told Vance. ""You don't get to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven and sure of himself."" Musk's first wife told his biographer, ""Elon is not someone who would say, 'I feel you. I see your point of view,. Because he doesn't have that 'I feel you' dimension there were things that seemed obvious to other people that weren't that obvious to him. He had to learn that a twenty something-year-old shouldn't really shoot down the plans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with them. He learned to modify his behavior in certain ways.""

6. Think of unusual ways to unite your team.

Employees at SpaceX let off steam by playing video games, a tradition that stretches back to early days at Zip2 where stress ran high and, at least early on, success was no sure thing, according to Vance's biography. While at Zip2, Musk even formed a video game team to participate in Quake competitions, which came in second and won several thousand dollars. ""We would have come in first, but one of our top players' machine crashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard,"" said Musk in an interview for Vance's book.

On Friday evening, Tesla customer Paul Franks tweeted the following:

@elonmusk can you guys program the car once in park to move back the seat and raise the steering wheel? Steering wheel is wearing. -- Paul Franks (@pjfranks1509) August 19, 2017

""@elonmusk can you guys program the car once in park to move back the seat and raise the steering wheel? Steering wheel is wearing.""

Just 24 minutes later, the famous CEO replied with the following message:

Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

""Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.""

Now that's how an effective CEO uses social media.

What's missing from this exchange is what we see in many companies: making excuses, shifting blame or responsibility to another department, or some other form of stalling that usually results in the death of good ideas.

In contrast, this is an example of active listening and bias for action.

Of course, this exchange illustrates the competitive advantage Tesla holds over competitors, as Elektrek's Jameson Dow explains:

One of the things Tesla is able to do, as a smaller company, is to make changes a lot more quickly than larger companies can. It also helps that Tesla's cars are capable of over-the-air updates, so if a feature is missed, it can be added later in a software update. Most manufacturers would add these as part of a new model year, in order to entice owners to upgrade their cars, but since the cost of the upgrade is so minor to Tesla, there's no reason not to push the software out to every owner. This keeps customers happy and keeps them evangelizing the brand, resulting in high customer satisfaction numbers.

The beauty, of course, is how Musk continues to work that competitive advantage, time and time again.

A Twitter Master

There's a lot to learn from observing Musk's Twitter habits.

Musk can't please all customers, though--and he refuses to try.

When one customer complained about older Tesla models not benefiting from newer technology, Musk didn't hold back:

Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2017

The key though, and what separates Musk from most other CEOs, is that he's actually listening--and responding.

Take a look at Musk's tweets, and you'll see this isn't some PR team putting their heads together to form appropriate responses. This isn't a social-media specialist that has to get everything approved by the higher-ups.

This is the (very smart) chief executive officer of one of the most innovative companies in the world, actively looking for feedback--and using it to solve problems."

He's one of the founding members of OpenAI, a nonprofit organization to steer the development of artificial intelligence for good, lest killer robots become the ""third revolution in warfare. ""

But that doesn't mean Musk doesn't have time to respond to a customer. On Twitter. Over the weekend.

Twitter user Paul Franks tweeted at Musk on Friday night with a request for Tesla: ""Can you guys program the car once in park to move back the seat and raise the steering wheel? Steering wheel is wearing.""

Musk responded: ""Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases."""

Musk took a break from posting (then deleting) weird videos on Twitter for a round of crowdsourced ideas this weekend, replying to fans' suggestions and requests to improve the Tesla owner experience.

This is far from the first time Musk has interacted with the public on the social platform for product feedback and ideas for new features, notably asking his 11.6 million strong follower base to help name his Boring Company's tunneling machines earlier this year. He responded to suggestions published in a newspaper too, back in 2014 — so if you put an idea in front of him, he might just listen.

Musk answered a whole slew of questions and comments, but request in particular sounds like it will make it to a future Tesla software update, which are frequently pushed out over-the-air (OTA) to the company's cars to fix bugs and keep them current with the latest breakthroughs.

Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

Musk did more than just promise updates, too. He explained to other curious owners exactly why their wishes aren't exactly feasible, given the cars' designs.

Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2017

He also teased a new cloud profile system for drivers — but didn't provide any exact details on its rollout.

Yeah, but not a priority right now — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 20, 2017

Musk has also perfected the art of using Twitter to build up hype for his companies and projects, which was abundantly clear after his super-premature declaration that his Boring Company will expand its operations to the East Coast last month.

The Tesla CEO is a master manipulator, and some might even call him a ""master of deception"" — but Musk's willingness to personally respond to consumer feedback (along with Tesla's ability to push OTA updates to its cars remotely) make the car company uniquely positioned to make the owner experience personalized unlike any other."

Last month his rocket company, SpaceX, made history by reusing a rocket — an achievement that could dramatically reduce the cost of spaceflight in the coming years. Meanwhile, his electric car company, Tesla, has seen its stock price soar. In early April, Tesla’s market value surpassed Ford’s as Wall Street got excited about Tesla’s forthcoming Model 3.

SpaceX and Tesla were far from overnight successes. Tesla repeatedly delayed the introduction of its first car. The first three SpaceX rocket launches all failed. Both companies nearly went bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis. But Musk persisted, and now both of his companies have competitors running scared.

To learn about the secrets of Musk’s success, I talked to Businessweek’s Ashlee Vance, the author of the excellent biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. A South African native, Musk moved to the US during the original dot-com boom and made a fortune as a co-founder of PayPal. Then instead of retiring to a tropical island, he plowed his PayPal fortune into SpaceX and Tesla.

For most people, creating three multibillion-dollar companies in different industries would be a big enough accomplishment for one lifetime. But Musk isn’t close to finished. His long-term goal is to, in his words, “make humans a multiplanetary species.”

It would be easy to dismiss dreams of colonizing Mars if they were coming from anyone else. But Musk doesn’t just have a record of exceeding expectations — he’s also the CEO of a rocket company that really could build a rocket capable of reaching Mars. Though Vance isn’t sure Musk’s Mars colonization plan will succeed, he certainly believes Musk is committed to the goal.

Vance and I spoke by phone on April 6. The transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Timothy B. Lee

People have been predicting that Elon Musk would fail for a long time, but he keeps exceeding people’s expectations. Why do you think so many people have underestimated him?

Ashlee Vance

It's kind of deserved in some ways because especially during the early SpaceX and Tesla days, he tended to jump into pretty big and complicated things and grossly underestimate the time and cost that would go into it. That cost him a lot because he had these eight years where it seemed like he was not accomplishing anything.

“Elon had ‘fuck you’ money, but he didn't really have rocket money”

The biggest thing people miss is his level of resolve and commitment. I've interviewed all these people in Silicon Valley, and I just never met anyone like him. For most people, even if they're a really passionate CEO, it's still a job. But for Elon, it's somewhere between a life-or-death struggle and a war. I think he's a hard character for people to peg.

This guy is committed on a level that is insane. He has no life on a lot of levels. He works all the time. He has burned through three marriages. He doesn't get enough time with his kids. He doesn't have anything like a normal existence. It's a sacrifice that no one else would be willing to make.

Timothy B. Lee

Two points of comparison that come to mind are Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos. All three men were extremely driven and ambitious. They all overcame early setbacks in their business careers. How do you think Musk compares to Jobs and Bezos?

Ashlee Vance

There are bits and pieces. You have the psychological bits. Jobs was adopted. In the case of Bezos, his first father abandoned him. Elon's got a lot of similar stuff. He wasn't adopted, but he had a pretty miserable childhood. His parents were not conventional parents by any stretch of the imagination. All three of those guys, you don't have to be a psychologist to know they're out trying to prove themselves to the world.

There's a degree to which Jobs and Bezos sort of had it easier than Elon because their businesses got so much bigger than his did. Steve was almost like an overnight success, and then, yeah, he went through his dark patch. Bezos, there were tons of doubters throughout Amazon, but it hit big throughout the dot-com boom and has kept going and going.

If you look at something like Blue Origin, Bezos’s rocket company, they've never had to have a for-profit business. Elon had “fuck you” money, but he didn't really have rocket money. The only way SpaceX could survive was turning this into an actual for-profit business. That was hard as hell. The company was really lucky to be alive.

Tesla was the same way. Those companies struggled for so long. Only now do they look like successes. And both companies could still go under. So Elon has been teetering on the edge for much longer than those other guys had to.

Elon is not the presenter that Jobs was; I don't think he's the design guru that Jobs was. He does have that attention to detail on the product. He knows every single fucking thing on the rockets and the cars. He makes decisions that are very Jobsian. None of the engineers wanted to do the retractable door handles on the Tesla Model S. Elon insisted, and it became this iconic feature. There were a lot of examples, like on the rockets, where people said, “The stuff you're doing is crazy.”

Timothy B. Lee

Another parallel: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and SpaceX are all famous for being difficult places to work because their CEOs frequently demanded the impossible from their employees and had no sense of work/life balance. Do you think that kind of management style is necessary to push people to achieve at the highest level in these industries, or would it have been possible for them to be successful without driving their people so hard?

Ashlee Vance

I’ve thought about this a lot. I don't think it's essential, but I think it depends what kind of business you're in.

When you hear people talking about Netflix, you don't hear the same kind of things. You have to work hard, but they have all these perks and they’ve created a culture that's sort of idyllic. You don't usually hear about people suffering in misery there.

But for all three of those guys, it does seem to be an incredibly effective approach. I don't know how long it's sustainable, but for a period of time they get more out of their employees than anyone else.

When SpaceX and Tesla started, if you were into space or electric vehicles, you'd put up with a lot to work on those companies. Because [Musk] was the only guy on the planet who could make your dreams come true. It was exciting, and you were willing to suffer.

Now there are lots of rocket companies, lots of interesting car companies. So I’m curious if he can keep it up.

Timothy B. Lee

Tesla and SpaceX have both repeatedly missed their early targets for delivering new products. Early Tesla cars and early SpaceX rockets came out years later than originally forecast. But [Musk] did eventually deliver on his promises.

Now there’s a lot of debate about whether Tesla will be able to deliver the Model 3 by the end of 2017 as he promised. How much do you think it matters if he’s late? As long as Musk eventually delivers a great product, does it matter if he misses his self-imposed deadlines?

Ashlee Vance

Elon uses unrealistic deadlines as a management tool to get the absolute most out of people.

To me, it's already getting kind of problematic. Tesla has this window right now where they can become the iPhone of cars. It's not just that they're electric; they have this amazing software in the car. They have this glow around them, and they have a limited window of opportunity to seize on that.

“If you were into space or electric vehicles, you'd put up with a lot to work on those companies”

We've already seen BMW and Audi building electric cars. They have way more expertise. If Tesla delays the Model 3, I think this catches up to them.

SpaceX is similar. SpaceX has rattled the cages, woken competitors up from their slumber. The whole premise is that this company can launch faster and cheaper than anybody else. If they stop being able to prove that, it takes away the mystique.

Timothy B. Lee

Are you sure the window is so short? Maybe the reason Tesla and SpaceX keep blowing through deadlines is that the stuff they’re working on is inherently difficult. Which could mean that competitors will take just as long to catch up.

Ashlee Vance

I think it's true to a degree. You can show the automakers what this is supposed to look like, and they are still going to struggle to build it. They are not wired to move quick enough to make this many changes. They're used to going on two- and four-year cycles. If Elon wants something to appear tomorrow on the screen, it's going to happen tomorrow. Those companies are probably never going to do that. I do think there's a cultural difference there that the upstart has an edge on the incumbent.

Same thing on the rockets. They can see what SpaceX is doing, but to mimic it, they'd have to unwind 50 years of culture and a lot of things about the way they build the rocket and how they contract things out.

So it depends on what kind of window you're talking about. If it's the Model 3 slips by six months, okay. If it's like three or four years, that starts to become an issue. That doesn't look like it's going to happen this time.

Everyone is caught up on the electric car thing, but one of the huge advantages of Tesla is software. The closer something comes to being a computer, the more that Silicon Valley is the place where people succeed.

When I started on the book, Ford had, like, an eight-person Silicon Valley play office out here. Google was hiring all these software guys, Tesla was hiring all these software guys. I think they still underestimate the challenge. It's not easy just to look at the thing and copy it because there's so many layers, from the technology to the manufacturing.

Timothy B. Lee

One of the big themes I noticed throughout your book was the importance of vertical integration for the success of both Tesla and SpaceX. Both companies started out with a plan to contract most of the components out to third parties and just do a few things themselves. But they kept finding that suppliers couldn’t meet their requirements — they delivered components too slowly, charged too much, didn’t have high enough performance, or whatever. And so over time, they built more and more stuff in house. And as a side effect, they were able to iterate a lot faster. How important do you think that has been to Elon Musk’s success?

Ashlee Vance

It's been critical. At the outset, SpaceX didn't want to build much of anything. They saw a lot of bloat and ways to be more efficient just by using the existing suppliers. But they discovered it was never going to happen on the level they wanted. Today the vertical integration at SpaceX is their supreme advantage over everyone else.

You see the United Launch Alliance, the Lockheed/Boeing rocket partnership, brag to Congress about having 1,200 suppliers in different states to make its rockets. It's like this job creation thing. I understand where it comes from, but it's insane. They're never going to get to the price of SpaceX. It's been this huge advantage along the way, and SpaceX has had to invent things along the way.

“Will SpaceX make a rocket that will go to Mars? I'm absolutely sure of that.”

I talk about a technique called friction stir welding in the book because it's a big fucking deal. It lets them make lighter rockets than anyone else. They had to make the machine to make the machine. For them to be able to make all these changes inside their own factory is absolutely a huge edge, instead of having the idea in California and then shipping it to Alabama and hoping it's implemented right.

Tesla started out the same way. They borrowed a body from Lotus. They didn't want to make their own transmission. But the supply chain became so bad because they were getting the car bodies from England and the batteries from Thailand. The costs were so high. So they had to do more of that themselves. Over time, they had to bring a lot of it in house.

One result: Today, the speed at which those guys test the prototypes is crazy. Their competitors can’t match it.

Timothy B. Lee

Musk has said that his ultimate goal is human colonization of Mars. Obviously that sounds a little bit crazy, but on the other hand he’s exceeded people’s expectations plenty of times before.

Ashlee Vance

When I started on the book, I was not a space geek. This is not like a cause for me. And I thought it was all nuts.

Now I divide it into two questions. Will SpaceX make a rocket that will go to Mars? I'm absolutely sure of that. It's not even an Elon thing; it's the level of talent and commitment on that company. On their computers they have CAD drawings of what this rocket will look like. A rocket will get to Mars, probably later than Elon is saying, but probably not too far off.

The second part is stuff like the habitats and how people would survive the initial days. None of that stuff actually exists yet. When you talk to Elon, he is so smart on this stuff he can buffalo you. You run out of questions to pin him down. Maybe he has it all worked out in his head.

Then you get to the stuff about heating the planet up. He's talked about bombing the poles with nuclear weapons. Nobody knows if that's going to work. That's where I feel like the details really start to fade away and it gets more sketchy.

But he's really going to try to do this. It’s not some PR stunt. And it's not just Elon. This is all these people’s life dream. These guys would not work in the SpaceX environment for all these years if they weren’t serious. There are tons of true believers. The cheers that go off when they land these rockets. You do not see that same sort of response at other companies."

If you want a job at Musk's aerospace company, there is one thing all candidates absolutely need to have: an appetite for exploration. ""We're out there looking for people that want to help us achieve that goal of making humans multi-planetary,"" SpaceX vice president of human resources Brian Bjelde recently told job listings and career site Glassdoor. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 and has since been making historic strides toward making reusable rockets, including its most recent accomplishment of launching the first reused rocket on a NASA mission. The company's ultimate goal is to enable people to live on other planets.

SpaceX has been rated one of the top places to work on Glassdoor for two consecutive years now. Given the volume of applications the company receives, Bjelde said he also looks for three things in candidates: passion, drive and talent. While your resume is key to detailing your accomplishments, Bjelde said his team really wants to learn what makes you tick, what motivates you to do your best work and how you like to be challenged. ""Resumes gauge the ability to write a bulleted list of achievements, and that's not always indicative of success — the resume is not going to be sitting in the seat doing the work on Monday,"" Bjelde said. One way he recommends that you make your resume more personable is to discuss a failure you've experienced in your career so far and discuss how you overcame it.

Furthermore, Bjelde wants hiring managers and employees who are part of the interviews to ""always be focused on hiring people better than themselves."" ""If you're given the opportunity to grow your team and you seek out someone better than yourself, then you're going to make the company better,"" he added. Previously an engineer at NASA and SpaceX, Bjelde noted that it's also important to put the candidates' skills to the test before hiring them.

""If you're hiring someone to be a world-class welder here, then we actually bring them in as part of the interview and give them a welding assignment to understand their talent with this task,"" Bjelde said. ""We do the same thing with our engineering groups, and with any role in which the work activity can be distilled into a practical examination."" What Bjelde ultimately wants to see in SpaceX candidates is the same mission-driven work ethic he sees from Musk, who has always made clear that the company's collective goal is to get humans to Mars. ""We're not all here to serve Elon Musk and his needs — rather, he's there to serve ours,"" Bjelde said. ""It's rare, and it's a breath of fresh air to have a leader who sincerely cares. It's not about the bottom line or making a dollar to him — it's about the mission."" Like this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook. Don't miss:

Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram

In a series of tweets on December 1, Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who founded SpaceX, said he planned to launch a Tesla electric car to Mars orbit in 2018.

Musk toyed with the popular press, first by confirming his plans with The Verge, then backpedaling, then again confirming it with Ars Technica and several other media outlets.

But if Musk had left any room for doubt, it is now gone.

On Friday afternoon, he posted a striking photo on Instagram of a 2008 red Tesla Roadster sitting in the carbon-fiber fairing of a Falcon Heavy rocket— just as he had promised.

The aerospace company says the launch vehicle, the first of its kind for SpaceX, is the most powerful rocket in the world today. (The Saturn V rocket NASA used to launch astronauts to the moon has been retired since the mid-1970s.)

With enough fuel and the right trajectory, Falcon Heavy has enough thrust to launch a payload heavier than a car to Pluto, let alone Mars.

""Test flights of new rockets usually contain mass simulators in the form of concrete or steel blocks. That seemed extremely boring,"" Musk wrote in his Instagram post. ""Of course, anything boring is terrible, especially companies, so we decided to send something unusual, something that made us feel.

""The payload will be an original Tesla Roadster, playing Space Oddity, on a billion year elliptic Mars orbit.""

Earlier this week, Musk revealed photos of the first Falcon Heavy ever built inside a hangar in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The 230-foot-tall three-booster rocket is scheduled to make its maiden launch no earlier than January.

But the reusable-rocket system is noticeably missing the clamshell top, or fairing, in the images.

Musk had demanded to be taken seriously before releasing the crucial photo of that missing part, though.

For example, Musk previously said he planned to launch the ""silliest thing we can imagine"" on Falcon Heavy's first test flight.

And in 2010, he launched a wheel of cheese into orbit during the maiden voyage of SpaceX's Dragon spaceship.

Falcon Heavy is also up to the task: SpaceX says it can ferry a payload of 37,000 pounds— roughly 14 Tesla Roadsters' worth of mass — to Mars.

""Red car for a red planet,"" Musk said in a Twitter reply in early December.

The Tesla won't be going to Mars, as Musk told Phil Plait, an astronomer and writer.

Instead, Plait wrote in a post for SyFy, it's ""going near Mars,"" specifically in what's called a Hohmann transfer orbit, a highly elliptical path that goes out to Mars orbit and back to Earth orbit on a nearly endless loop - hence the ""billion year"" detail from Musk.

It's unlikely the Tesla will be empty, just playing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" on repeat. Joy Dunn, an engineer at the company, tweeted on December 1, ""This is legit and of course there will be cameras!""

Musk also told Plait he was willing to consider launching other objects inside the Tesla suggested by the public.

""Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up,"" Musk told Plait in an email. ""So I wouldn't put anything of irreplaceable sentimental value on it.""

Below are other photos Musk posted of the Tesla inside Falcon Heavy's fairing."

For those who weren't lucky enough to make his mailing list, we're publishing it below.

Earthlings measure years by how long it takes this planet to revolve around its sun, but I’ve always had a different relationship with time, and not just because I’m a Martian. (Kidding. Maybe. You know, don’t worry about it.) But even I can’t deny things are moving forward. And with so much going on in my life, this seems as good a time as any to share my family's latest accomplishments.

(NB: For ease of use, I’ll be using Earth years.)

SpaceX (age 15) Man these companies grow up fast. SpaceX didn’t just successfully launch its 12th resupply missionto the International Space Station this summer, it upped its ambitions with a pretty detailed plan for colonizing Mars. (OK, as long as it comes home for Thanksgiving and Christmas!) The scheme involves an Interplanetary Transport System the company calls the BFR, or Big Fucking Rocket (you wonder where they get their sense of humor!), which it will definitely have built in just five years.

OpenAI and Neuralink (ages 2, 1) I’ve always thought we should merge our brains with computers, and I’m so glad two of my youngest are dedicated to making it happen. As if that weren’t enough, OpenAI is using surprisingly svelte sumo wrestlersto make artificial intelligence smarter and nimbler. Maybe it’ll even find the time to help big brother Tesla with that AI chip it’s making for Autopilot.

The Boring Company (age 1) Celebrated its first birthday this month! And based on the tunnels it has been digging under SpaceX’s headquarters in Los Angeles and under Baltimore, I have to wonder if someone cheated on me with the moleman! Now, Boring knows my views on public transit, and has reassured me these tunnels will be for fancy hyperloops and private cars on electric sleds, only. I’m glad to know that when it’s time for the old man to visit his kid underground, I won’t have to worry about serial killers or even other people.

So, my friends and fans, comrades and competitors, investors short and long, my best tidings. May your lives be as rich, electrifying, and ambitious as ours.

[Updated],2017-12-22 12:26:00,2019-06-24 14:46:56.964624,George Dvorsky + About The Author + George Is A Senior Staff Reporter At Gizmodo.,"An apparently leaked photo emerged on Reddit late last night purportedly showing Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster getting fitted atop a Falcon Heavy cargo capsule. Which poses the question: Is Musk actually serious about all this?



This whole thing got started in early December when the SpaceX CEO announced on Twitter that he was planning to use his own personal Tesla Roadster as the dummy payload for the inaugural Falcon Heavy Launch, which is scheduled for January 2018. Musk, who’s actually skeptical the Falcon Heavy will even make it into Earth’s orbit on its first flight, said the payload would launch on a trajectory towards Mars.

This next-gen rocket will be capable of lifting a 140,700 pound (63,800 kg) payload to low Earth orbit, or a 37,000 pound (16,800 kg) payload to Mars. So what better way to flex the muscle of the Falcon Heavy by having it fling a 4,000-pound Tesla Roadster into the Great Beyond?

Trouble is, The Verge reported that Musk later denied the whole thing. But then, speaking to Ars Technica after that, Musk and another Space X official said it was very much on. Fact is, we don’t know if Musk is being serious or not, but we’re not one to throw it past him. The man seems thrilled with the idea of his sexy midnight cherry Roadster drifting for eternity through the depths of space.

As for the authenticity of this photo, the image appears to have originated from this anonymous Reddit account before getting picked up by the SpaceX subreddit. The photo shows what seems to be a red Tesla Roadster atop a Payload Attach Fitting (PAF)—one that looks virtually identical to the PAF shown in SpaceX’s Falcon User’s Guide.

Given that a sports car has never been shot into space, it’s difficult to know how it would be oriented as cargo. This seems as good an orientation as any. There’s nothing to immediately suggest the image itself is fake, but there’s nothing proving it’s real either. And even if it is real, this shot could have been posed as an elaborate continuation of Musk’s weird joke.

We reached out to SpaceX and Elon Musk for comment and will update this post should we get a response.

Update 2:40 pm: Asked if the photo was real, Musk responded to Gizmodo with this DM:

So Photoshop :)

That settles that, then?"

The planned trajectory: a ""billion year elliptic Mars orbit."" The soundtrack: David Bowie's ""Space Oddity.""

On Friday, Musk revealed the setup in a photo slideshow posted to Instagram. The Roadster appears bright red in the center of SpaceX's slate grey rocket, called Falcon Heavy.

Musk's SpaceX venture, alongside Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic enterprise and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, is one of a few private companies committed to exploring travel to the Moon and Mars. The Falcon Heavy rocket is powerful enough to launch a fully booked 737 jet into orbit, and is designed to carry human cargo into space.

The mission is seen as a precursor to sending humans to Mars.

Elon Musk is really sending his Tesla Roadster to Mars.

On Friday (Dec. 22), Musk, the CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX, posted photos to his Instagram account revealing the “midnight cherry” electric sports car being prepared for launch on the company’s first Falcon Heavy rocket.

""Test flights of new rockets usually contain mass simulators in the form of concrete or steel blocks. That seemed extremely boring,"" Musk wrote on the photo sharing website. ""Of course, anything boring is terrible, especially companies, so we decided to send something unusual, something that made us feel."" [SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Rocket in Images]

""The payload will be an original Tesla Roadster, playing 'Space Oddity,' on a billion year elliptic Mars orbit,"" Musk wrote in the post, which he titled: ""A Red Car for the Red Planet.""

A photo posted by on

Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, first announced that his Roadster was space-bound Dec. 1 on Twitter. The announcement was first met with some skepticism, but the photos should put any doubt to rest.

The images show the red convertible atop a payload adapter, positioned between the two towering halves of the fairing that will be mounted atop the Falcon Heavy rocket, shielding the Roadster during its ascent into Earth orbit. If successful, the launch will put the car on a path to intercept the orbit of Mars.

The Falcon Heavy combines three SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, such that it rides atop 27 Merlin engines firing in unison. When it enters service, it will be the most powerful rocket in operation, capable of lifting the equivalent of a Boeing 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel.

The Falcon Heavy’s two side-mounted boosters and central core are designed to be reusable, flying back to Earth to land on land- and sea-based platforms.

The maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy, with the Tesla Roadster, is targeted for January from Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Musk is well ahead of schedule (a rarity for Tesla!), with the 100MW battery set to be energised and tested in the coming days, according to a press release from the local state government.

Tesla Powerpacks have been installed and connected at Neoen's Hornsdale windfarm, north of Adelaide, and battery tests will be run to ensure local regulatory requirements are met before it begins operating on December 1st. South Australia suffered a state wide blackout last September, which sparked a highly politicized national debate about energy security. The Australian Government blamed the failure of renewable energy to cover usage. Musk's battery farm stores huge amounts of energy from renewable sources like wind and solar, and funnels it out to the grid when usage is high.

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Musk made his promise in March on Twitter and the 100-day countdown started at the end of September after the company inked a deal with the South Australian government. Musk essentially delivered his promise in about two months, well short of the self-imposed 100-day deadline. The battery is estimated to cost at least $50 million.

""The world’s largest lithium ion battery will be an important part of our energy mix, and it sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader [sic] renewable energy with battery storage,"" South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement. ""An enormous amount of work has gone in to delivering this project in such a short time."""

Back in March, the Tesla founder made a bet on Twitter with Mike Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian, an Australian enterprise software company, that he would be able to install the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Australia within 100 days, or he would supply it for free. That “free” would have been anything but to Musk, who said failing to meet the deadline would have cost him “$50 million or more,” Business Insider reports.

The 129-megawatt-hour battery was being built by Musk for South Australia, which generates a substantial percentage of its energy from wind power. Musk vowed to install the battery within 100 days of signing as agreement with the state government, which he did in September.

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

The goal with the battery pack is to make South Australia more self-sufficient and able to provide backup power and affordable energy to South Australians during the summer months.

The battery is part of a $550 million plan by South Australia to help guarantee its power supply after a string of blackouts over the last 18 months. The state has not indicated how much it is paying Musk for the battery. A 250MW gas-fired generator is also expected to come online in the area next summer to help ease energy concerns.

Musk also recently supplied battery power to help aid Puerto Rico’s electrical grid following the devastating hurricane earlier this year."

Mark Brake / Getty Images

Elon Musk will get paid for building the world's largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, as the 100-megawatt project is about to begin testing ahead of a December 1 deadline to complete building it or make it free.

State premier Jay Weatherill announced on Thursday that regulatory testing at the site — which is paired with the French energy business Neoen's Hornsdale wind farm, 230 kilometres north of Australia's capital, Adelaide — would begin within days.

When fully charged, the battery, Tesla's Powerpack, is expected to hold enough power for 8,000 homes for 24 hours, or more than 30,000 houses for an hour during a blackout.

The project is part of a $550 million plan by the state to guarantee energy supply following a statewide blackout last year that turned into a national political debate over energy security and costs. A 250-megawatt gas-fired generator, expected to cost $360 million, is also due to come online this summer to provide extra power.

The battery is the result of a Twitter bet between the Tesla founder and Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes in March that he would supply the battery within 100 days or it was free. The clock began ticking when Musk visited Adelaide in September to sign off on the deal — though work was already underway on the plant after the government gave the contract to Musk in July.

Musk had said that if he failed to meet the deadline, it would have cost him ""probably $50 million or more.""

The Tesla plant will be called upon during periods of ""load shedding,"" when excess demand would otherwise result in blackouts.

Weatherill said that the battery was now complete and that the testing would ensure it is optimised and meets energy market regulatory requirements.

""It sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader in renewable energy with battery storage,"" he said. ""An enormous amount of work has gone into delivering this project in such a short time, and I look forward to visiting Jamestown next week to personally thank those who have worked on this project."""

And if the billionaire CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company can realize his lofty ambitions — whether it’s sending humans to Mars, bringing self-driving electric cars to the masses, or helping build a whole new transportation infrastructure with the hyperloop — then he has a chance to do well for humanity too. For now, his companies have already proved commercial spaceflight is viable, sold a quarter-million electric cars, and introduced solar power technology that is already assisting Puerto Rico’s post-hurricane recovery.

But all of Musk’s staggering success up to this point is built on what is frankly an equally staggering amount of failure, and whatever future success he has will likely be accompanied by still more failure. Throughout his career, he has shown a knack from learning from those setbacks and emerging stronger from them.

Here are three times Elon Musk has failed harder than you ever will — and how he emerged better for the experience."

I confess to finding more than a few Tesla owners a little hard to stomach.

It's the license plates, you see.

They waft around my local freeways parading their emissions-saving puns for all to see.

LESCO2E, for example.

Sigh.

Then again, they do have a loyalty to the brand that rises above many.

This is something Elon Musk chooses to foster.

As well as sending rockets up into space, Tesla's CEO uses Twitter to talk to his customers not from on high, but with a remarkable frankness.

So while you were calling your local gastroenterologist in order to find the latest cures for gout-level gorging, Musk took to Twitter -- at 8.45 a.m. the day after Christmas, no less -- to utter some seemingly honest thoughts.

Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.



So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you'd truly love. I hope you do.



How can we improve further? -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017

And so his customers chimed in.

One wanted a pickup truck. Well, there's nothing finer than trying to offer sanctimony to Ford F-150 owners, is there? Just imagine the trucking puns.

Musk immediately replied.

I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017

Yes, he just revealed Tesla's next model. And made it seem like a natural revelation in a conversation with customers.

Another suggestion was even more detailed. It concerned the Model S's browser.

Yeah, it's terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017

And when a customer had a long list of suggestions, Musk was astoundingly open. Perhaps too open.

Was gonna say we'll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :) -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017

This isn't just good marketing.

Disco mode? Lord, help us.

This open communication allows Tesla's customers to see that they're being sold to by someone who genuinely wants to make the product and the experience around it better.

Curmudgeons might think this mere callow marketing, especially at a time when Tesla's production simply isn't keeping up with its promises.

But it's far more than most CEOs will ever bother to do.

Yes, Steve Jobs would sometimes reply to customer emails. Tim Cook does it, too.

Musk's competitors are, though, vast molochs who believe that they have the scale and the money to ultimately crush his idealism.

Do their CEOs communicate like this?

Hardly.

I own two moloch cars. The only time I heard from a CEO of either was when he had to admit that there'd been a little touch of fraud when it came to the diesel engine's performance.

Well, thank you for admitting that. I'd already heard.

With these tweets, Musk is exhibiting not just marketing skills, but true leadership.

It isn't just customers who must be impressed and disarmed by the utter soul-baring nature of the conversation.

Those who work for Tesla surely look at his tweets and see a CEO who is genuinely committed to creating something extraordinary and is prepared to go far beyond the norm to do it. Even the day after Christmas.

Which, one imagines, motivates them a little in the darker times.

Yes, I also imagine that some of the promises he makes might cause one or two of them to shudder.

Perhaps Tesla will, one day soon, collapse beneath the weight of its own promises and expectations. Perhaps Musk will be exiled, before making some sort of triumphant return in years to come.

I'm still rather more fascinated with his attitude and his way of doing business than with that of so many other so-called leaders.

At the same time, I do worry about some of Musk's customers.

One, for example, frothed on Twitter to quite a degree.

All I want for the holidays is better navigation software. Having to rely on my phone to get an accurate time of when I get home (in SF no less) is both painful for me and embarrassing when others are in the car. -- Leslie (@Kreative) December 26, 2017

My, what a level of embarrassment. How can one ever, ever get over that?

When it comes to balancing his five ventures — SpaceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Company — Musk says at one point he used to work up to 100 hours a week (for reference, there are 168 hours in a week). Nowadays, Musk commits to working a mere 80 to 90 hours a week. During Tesla's annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said he spends 90 percent of his time divided between SpaceX and Tesla and the remaining less than 10 percent on everything else.

Work even while relaxing

During a 2013 interview at South by Southwest, Musk said he responds to emails while also interacting with his children because they were at an age where they didn't require his undivided attention, reports Business Insider. As part of a speaker series at the Computer History Museum in 2013, Musk noted having a smartphone has been helpful because whether out at drinks, in other social settings, in a car, while walking or in the bathroom, you can do email anytime while you are awake.

Get the right number of hours of sleep

During his 100-hour work weeks, Musk says he would drink eight cans of Diet Coke and fuel up on several cups of coffee. He says he has since cut back and despite working twice as many hours as most Americans, he manages to get about six or six and half hours of sleep. ""Sleep is really great, I find if I don't get enough sleep then I'm quite grumpy,"" Musk said during his Computer History Museum talk. ""I found that I can drop below a certain threshold of sleep and although I would be awake for more hours and I could sustain it, I would get less done because my mental acuity would be affected."""

Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk and Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg are locked in a very public feud over the future of artificial intelligence.

Musk has repeatedly warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence, describing it as a potentially existential threat to the human race.

Zuckerberg has a different view. On Sunday, he responded to a question about Musk's warnings by saying he was tired of the fear-mongering.

""With AI especially, I'm really optimistic,"" Zuckerberg said during a Facebook Live broadcast. ""I think that people who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios -- I just, I don't understand it. I think it's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.""

Musk shot back on Tuesday morning with a tweet saying, ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.""

I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 25, 2017

Musk added that a movie on the subject of AI was ""coming soon,"" but didn't provide details about the film or his involvement.

Musk ignited a global discussion on the perils of AI in 2014. He predicted that humans might be doomed if we make machines that are smarter than us. But he said in a recent interview with the website waitbutwhy.com that his warnings haven't being heeded.

Musk, who's already leading space exploration projects and major tunneling initiatives, is now trying to develop AI that he hopes will have a positive impact on humanity. He's heading up a startup called Neuralink that intends to build devices to connect the human brain with computers.

Zuckerberg is no stranger to AI. He worked last year on developing an artificial intelligence system to help run his life and his home. After about 100 hours of work, he posted a video at the end of 2016 showcasing an AI system called Jarvis, which is voiced by the actor Morgan Freeman.

""My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence,"" Zuckerberg said at the time, ""where we're further along than people realize and where we're still a long ways off.""

Facebook is also developing augmented reality features for smartphones and virtual reality worlds that can be experienced through the company's headset, Oculus.

In his Facebook Live broadcast on Sunday, Zuckerberg said that AI could be a force for good because it helps power self-driving cars and diagnose illnesses.

""If you're arguing against AI, then you're arguing against safer cars that aren't going to have accidents. And you're arguing against being able to better diagnose people when they're sick. I just don't see how, in good conscience, some people can do that. I'm just much more optimistic on this, in general, than probably a lot of folks are,"" Zuckerberg said.

Today on Twitter, Elon Musk dismissed Mark Zuckerberg’s understanding of the threat posed by artificial intelligence as “limited,” after the Facebook founder disparaged comments Musk made on the subject earlier this month.

The beef (such as it is) goes back to a speech the SpaceX and Tesla CEO made to an assembly of US governors. Musk warned that there needed to be regulation on AI development before it’s too late. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal,” he said, adding that the technology represents a “fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.”

Are both Musk and Zuckerberg missing the point?

It’s a familiar refrain from Musk, and one that doesn’t hold much water within the AI community. Pedro Domingos, a machine learning researcher and author of The Master Algorithm, summed up the feelings of many with a one word response on Twitter: “Sigh.” Later, Domingos expanded on this in an interview with Wired, saying: “Many of us have tried to educate [Musk] and others like him about real vs. imaginary dangers of AI, but apparently none of it has made a dent.”

Fast-forward to this Sunday, when Zuckerberg was running one of his totally-normal-and-not-running-for-political-office Facebook Live Q&As. At around 50 minutes in, a viewer asks Zuckerberg: “I watched a recent interview with Elon Musk and his largest fear for the future was AI. What are your thoughts on AI and how it could affect the world?”

Zuck responds: “I have pretty strong opinions on this ... I think you can build things and the world gets better, and with AI especially, I’m really optimistic. I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I think it is pretty irresponsible.”

He goes on to predict that in the next five to 10 years AI will deliver “so many improvements in the quality of our lives,” and cites health care and self-driving cars as two major examples. “People who are arguing for slowing down the process of building AI, I find that really questionable,” Zuckerberg concludes. “If you’re arguing against AI you’re arguing against safer cars that aren’t going to have accidents.”

Someone then posted a write-up of Zuckerberg’s Q&A on Twitter and tagged Musk, who jumped into the conversation with the comment below. Musk also linked approvingly to an article on the threat of superintelligent AI by Tim Urban. (The article covers much of the same ground as Nick Bostrom’s influential book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. Both discuss a number of ways contemporary AI could develop into super-intelligence, including through exponential growth in computing power — something Musk later tweeted about.)

But as fun as it is to watch two extremely rich people, who probably wield more influence over your life than most politicians, trade barbs online, it’s hard to shake the feeling that both Musk and Zuckerberg are missing the point.

While AI researchers dismiss Musk’s comments on AI as alarmist, that’s only in reference to the imagined threat of some Skynet-style doomsday machine. The same experts frequently point out that artificial intelligence poses many genuine threats that already affect us today. These include how the technology can amplify racist and sexist prejudices; how it could upend society by putting millions out of jobs; how it is set to increase inequality; and how it will be used as tool of control by authoritarian governments.

These are real dangers that need real solutions, not just sci-fi speculation.

And while Zuckerberg’s comments on the potential benefits of AI in health care and road safety are heartening, focusing only on the good that artificial intelligence can deliver is — in its own way — as limited as focusing only on the threat. Really, we need to combine both Musk and Zuckerberg’s approaches, and probably listen less to tech billionaires in the process."

Billionaire business icon Elon Musk — of Tesla, SpaceX and more fame — just fired back at Mark Zuckerberg over his grasp of the future of AI, claiming that the Facebook CEO’s “understanding of the subject is limited.”

Ouch… but Musk himself has been accused of knowing little about AI, from Rodney Brooks, the founding director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Brooks is also the cofounder of both iRobot and Rethink Robotics.

He was responding to comments made by Zuckerberg this weekend — he chatted to fans on a Facebook live stream for an hour and a half while grilling meat on his BBQ, no less. The social network supremo had some strong words for AI pessimists (realists?) who believe and argue that care and regulation is needed to safeguard the future of our race before AI becomes mainstream.

Musk is fairly outspoken on this topic. While a proponent of tech and artificial intelligence in particular, he recently called its progress the “biggest risk we face as a civilisation.”

“AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because if we’re reactive in AI regulation it’s too late,” he said at a meeting of U.S. governors this year.

AI is increasingly a critical part of the Facebook business, while Zuckerberg himself has tinkered with the tech to develop his own home automation system, so perhaps naturally he feels differently.

“I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don’t understand it. It’s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,” he said, according to Silicon Valley Business Journal.

The publication evidently tuned in for the full 90-minute grill-fest, alongside over four million others.

AI is a multi-faceted and complicated subject. And not one that 140-character tweets or back-garden live streams are best suited for explaining. This back-and-forth between two of the world’s most influential figures in business will at least help bring this topic to the fore, and encourage deeper discussions around the future of AI.

Zuckerberg and Musk have been involved in drama before. Last year, a Facebook satellite was destroyed when the SpaceX rocket carrying it exploded on launch in Florida. The satellite was part of Facebook’s Internet.org global connectivity program."

On Sunday, Zuckerberg took to Facebook Live talking informally to viewers while at a barbecue. A user submitted a question saying how they had seen a recent interview with Musk in which he said his largest fear for the future was AI.

Musk has been vocal about his fear of AI in the future. Earlier this month for example, he said that AI will cause massive job disruption and that robots ""will be able to do everything better than us."" The Tesla CEO has also advocated a policy of universal basic income to protect people from the fallout of AI disruption.

Zuckerberg however, doesn't agree with Musk's view. During the Facebook Live, Zuckerberg called doomsday scenarios about AI ""pretty irresponsible"".

""I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,"" Zuckerberg said.

""In the next five to 10 years, AI is going to deliver so many improvements in the quality of our lives, "" added Zuckerberg.

A Twitter user posted an article about Zuckerberg's comments. Musk, responding to the tweet, said that he has already spoken to Zuckerberg about this and that the Facebook CEO's ""understanding of the subject is limited.""

Another twitter user replied that he should write a blog post, to which Musk responded jokingly that a movie on the subject is ""coming soon"".

It is an unusually public spat for the two technology CEOs, neither of which have competing businesses. But it highlights the level of debate happening in the technology community over the future of AI.

Musk has previously warned that humans will need to merge with machines or risk becoming irrelevant. And while the two might disagree on the impact AI has, Zuckerberg, like Musk, agrees with the idea of a universal basic income to help cushion any fallout from new technology."

SpaceX has experience building traditional life support systems for its Crew Dragon capsule, a spaceship built for NASA.

But independent spaceflight experts say technologies that don't yet exist are necessary to keep Martian colonists alive.

Musk and SpaceX have yet to detail exactly how hypothetical Mars explorers and colonists will survive.

Industry experts are excited by Musk's vision to back up the human race by putting 1 million people on a new planet, but many have practical questions for the tech billionaire and founder of SpaceX. Above all, they're eager to know how Musk plans to keep people alive on Mars for months or years on end.

Musk's latest talk at the International Astronautical Congress 2017 in Adelaide updated a roughly one-hour presentation that he gave at the same event in September 2016.

""The future is vastly more interesting and exciting if we're a space-faring civilization, and a multi-planet species, than if we're not,"" Musk said on Friday. ""I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there among the stars.""

Musk first unveiled his Mars vehicle design -- which he used to call the ""Interplanetary Transport System"" but now calls the ""Big F---ing Rocket"" (BFR for short) -- during IAC 2016.

The original rocket-and-spaceship vehicle was supposed to tower 400 feet, or slightly higher than a Saturn V moon rocket. It was designed to bring up to 300 tons of spaceship cargo -- about two blue whales' worth of mass -- into orbit around Earth.

Musk's latest BFR design is about 50 feet shorter, and its spaceship is supposed to carry about half the payload. SpaceX has already built and tested key pieces of hardware in hopes of launching its first mission to Mars in 2022.

""That's not a typo. Although it is aspirational,"" Musk said when the date appeared on-screen at the event. ""I feel fairly confident that we can complete the ship and be ready or launch in about five years. Five years seems like a long time to me.""

Musk hopes to fly four additional ships to Mars in 2024, including two cargo missions and two ships carrying the first Martian explorers. From there, an increasing number of missions could establish and grow a colony.

""You can do it, Elon!"" a man shouted from his seat after hearing these details at the conference.

Some spaceflight engineers and experts, however, are wondering whether he can.

""Elon lays out an impossibly large vision, and then revises it slightly downward -- and people say he's being practical. This is no more practical than it was last year,"" John Logsdon, a space policy expert, author, and spaceflight historian at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, told Business Insider. ""There are so many questions on the viability of this plan.""

Big on ambition, thin on details

According to Musk's new plan, two uncrewed missions would pave the way for future human exploration of Mars. The first would locate sources of water in the soil, and the second would set up a chemical factory to turn that water, plus carbon dioxide in the thin Martian air, into oxygen and methane rocket fuel.

After the first people land on Mars, regular cargo launches would resupply them with food and other essentials.

D. Marshall Porterfield, the former director of NASA's Space Life and Physical Sciences Division, said SpaceX's reusable rocket technologies are ""a huge game-changer"" in terms of lowering steep launch costs and enabling such missions.

""He totally changed the economics,"" Porterfield, now a professor at Purdue University, told Business Insider during the university's ""Dawn or Doom"" conference before Musk's latest talk.

A fully reusable rocket and spaceship, as Musk is proposing with the BFR, would compound the savings and open access to space even further by lowering costs 100- or even 1,000-fold, according to Musk.

""We could assemble space exploration capabilities in orbit [around Earth] and launch a mission to Mars from there,"" Porterfield said, adding that the first crewed Martian missions will be like ""vacations"" compared to the ""camping trips"" of the Apollo program.

""The scenario in 'The Martian' is completely doable,"" he said, referencing the sci-fi book and movie in which a NASA astronaut is accidentally stranded at a Martian outpost.

Indeed, SpaceX may have the expertise it needs to get the first explorers to Mars and back alive.

The company already built the environmental control and life support system, or ECLSS, that keeps astronauts alive and comfortable on its Crew Dragon spacecraft.

NASA is counting on Dragon to ferry its astronauts to and from the International Space Station starting in 2018. (Russia's Soyuz spacecraft is current the only ride to orbit -- and it's recently quadrupled ticket prices.) SpaceX is even pondering a privately funded mission around the moon using Dragon and ECLSS.

In his IAC talks, Reddit chats, and other public statements, however, Musk has not detailed how SpaceX will keep the first Martian explorers alive.

When Business Insider contacted SpaceX for details about its Mars life support plans and responses to expert commentary, a spokesperson declined to comment and instead emailed several of Musk's prior public statements.

One came from his IAC 2016 talk, when Musk compared Mars to California in the early US, and said SpaceX is trying to build the Union Pacific Railroad.

""Once that transport system is built, then there's a tremendous opportunity for anyone who wants to go to Mars and create something new or build the foundations of a new planet,"" Musk said at the time.

Musk also said he expects SpaceX's Mars effort ""to be a huge public-private partnership,"" and that the company is ""trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources that we have available."" He added that he hopes his plans spur companies to develop their own competing and innovative approaches, and that colonizing Mars -- no matter who gets the job done -- is his goal.

Porterfield believes the company needs systems that currently do not exist.

""His idea about colonizing? That's going to require ... bioregenerative life support capabilities,"" he said.

Using life to support life

The idea behind bioregenerative life support, which Porterfield worked on at NASA, is to collect a human crew's breath, liquid waste, and solid waste -- then use plants and other life forms to recycle it into food, water, and air.

This would reduce the need for resupply missions and help ensure a crew's long-term survival. It would also make a colony vastly more sustainable, affordable, and independent.

""Biological systems are really resilient,"" Porterfield said. ""They tend to be self-healing, self-repairing, so that's one of the advantages of a bioregenerative life support capability.""

Spacecraft today don't rely on bioregeneration to keep people alive. Instead, they use traditional life support systems -- pumps, filters, compressors, chemicals, and the like. SpaceX's ECLSS is one such system.

Research into these traditional systems flourished during the Cold War, and more recent developments have turned out new capabilities. For instance, the space station recently got a new chemical-mechanical system that can recycle -- with 93% efficiency -- an astronaut's urine, evaporated sweat, and breath into drinking water.

Research into biological life support systems also occurred during the Cold War, though to a far lesser extent -- for example, one Soviet experiment used algae to generate oxygen inside sealed nuclear bunkers. Since then, a few experiments in orbit and on the ground have shown it's possible to grow edible plants in space and in Martian soil.

Yet Porterfield said ""tremendous challenges"" must be overcome before any biology-based technology can fully and reliably keeping people alive in deep space.

""It's not just a module you can stick on to grow some plants in, and have some fresh salads every once in awhile,"" he said. ""We're really talking about technology that replaces what the Earth does. This is our current bioregenerative life support system.""

In his talk at the ""Dawn or Doom"" conference, Porterfield brought up the Biosphere 2 experiment in Arizona as an example of the challenges. Eight people lived in the sealed, three-acre habitat for two years with a bounty of plants and animals -- yet they quickly encountered problems severe enough to require outside help, including pumping in oxygen.

A more compact and successful experiment was NASA's Biomass Production Chamber -- a giant, sealed greenhouse built inside a hyperbaric chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. The chamber broke world records for food production with a variety of crops from the late 1980s through the early 2000s.

But NASA's space greenhouse was scrapped in the 2000s, along with other research into biological life support, due to congressional budget cuts.

""NASA basically gutted the entire future of spaceflight exploration in order to finish building the space station, and we really haven't fully invested in supporting the sciences required to use the space station today so that we can be competitive,"" Porterfield said.

He added that China is poised to overtake the US in bioregeneration with its ""Lunar Palace-1"" experiment, which has sealed four students inside a habitat with plants and animals for a year.

'They really don't have a science program'

A few years ago, when Porterfield worked for NASA, he and some colleagues were invited to SpaceX. Musk pitched a flyby mission to Mars that'd cost about $600 million, and Porterfield and his colleagues were interested.

""They were going to launch a payload, orbit Mars, and bring it back to Earth,"" he said. ""For us it would have been a great opportunity to look at radiation environment out beyond the Van Allen Belts, because right now we're at the space station, where we're shielded from that deep-space radiation."" (Musk has downplayed the risks of space radiation, though new research suggests it could be twice as dangerous at Mars as previously thought.)

Porterfield thought NASA higher-ups would bite, but they ultimately passed on SpaceX's offer.

""During that time, though, I learned they [SpaceX] really don't have a science program, per se, that would enable them to really consider ... bioregenerative or even just greenhouse-type of technologies in a Mars architecture,"" Porterfield said.

Logsdon offered a similarly skeptical assessment.

""SpaceX is a very good engineering firm. Certainly they're going to design a system that makes every effort for high level of safety,"" Logsdon said. ""But they haven't said a word about how people will survive once they get to Mars. It just isn't a part of their capabilities.""

Despite NASA's budgetary de-emphasis on bioregenerative programs, Porterfield said he hasn't noticed any staff migrations that suggest SpaceX might be acquiring expertise to research bioregenerative capabilities (though he noted he does not keep close tabs on SpaceX's hiring efforts).

If Porterfield had a chance to ask Musk any questions about his Mars plan, he said he'd focus on life support.

""I'd directly ask him, 'What are you doing in terms of countermeasures for crew health? What's your thinking in that area? Are you just going to, in the moment of finalizing your Mars architecture, are you going to adopt the current countermeasures and polices that NASA is doing?'"" he said. ""Maybe that's enough. But in terms of other aspects of biological foundations for human exploration, it may not be enough.""

La Monica,"Tesla's stock has been a market darling this year and there is a lot of investor and consumer excitement about the company's new Model 3 electric car.

But one prominent Wall Street analyst thinks that Tesla (TSLA) and its increasingly stretched-for-time CEO Elon Musk should consider merging the company with his other big venture -- rocket company SpaceX.

Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said in a report Tuesday that Tesla's biggest challenge is fierce competition not just from traditional auto makers, but tech companies looking to step up their efforts in the driverless car market. Think Uber, Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL).

""Tesla's addressable market of sustainable transport will attract fierce competition from some of the world's best capitalized tech firms with arguably superior access to capital, talent and business models that can monetize vehicle data and content opportunities,"" Jonas wrote.

Jonas added that this is ""threatening the long-term independence of Tesla as a stand-alone entity.""

Tesla is currently valued at about $50 billion, making it worth more than established auto giants Ford (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Nissan (NSANY) and putting it within striking distance of surpassing GM (GM) and Honda (HMC).

But even though Tesla's stock is still up 40% in 2017, it has plunged more than 20% since it hit an all-time high near $390 a share in mid-September.

Concerns about production delays for the Model 3, which is meant to be Tesla's affordable, mass market car, are weighing on the company.

The fact that Tesla has added yet another new product to the mix -- a Semi truck -- also has investors nervous about Tesla biting off more than it can chew.

And there are lingering questions about whether Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity, a renewable energy company, co-founded by two of his cousins, of which Musk was chairman, will serve as yet another distraction for the still unprofitable Tesla.

Related: Tesla's truck won't be out until 2019...but there are already orders for it

That's where SpaceX comes in. SpaceX, which has backing from Musk as well as venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, mutual fund giant Fidelity and Google owner Alphabet, is valued at $21.5 billion, according to research firm CB Insights.

That makes SpaceX the sixth-most valuable unicorn startup on the planet, albeit a company that's not as big as Tesla.

But Jonas thinks SpaceX has a brighter future than Tesla. He argues SpaceX could be worth as much as $121 billion if everything goes right for the company. The space travel business could be worth as much as $1.75 trillion by 2040, Jonas wrote.

And while SpaceX must contend with the Jeff Bezos-backed Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance -- a joint venture of Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) -- there is far less competition than there is in the automotive world.

""Our preliminary modeling of SpaceX reveals a launch business that could be in a highly dominant position, positioning the company to enter highly profitable markets, such as proprietary satellite broadband,"" Jonas wrote.

Related: Musk trolls Tesla haters on Twitter

Jonas noted that Tesla and SpaceX already share knowledge about manufacturing -- particularly the use of aluminum casting --and that SpaceX employees have often been used to beta test Tesla cars. So a further alliance wouldn't be out of the question.

A merger of Tesla and SpaceX could also reassure Wall Street that Musk will remain as focused on his electric car business as he is on one day setting foot on Mars.

""Investors widely expect Elon Musk to, over time, devote increasing amounts of his time and talents to SpaceX, raising the very real question of who could replace him at Tesla. A combination of efforts between the two firms could address this important issue,"" Jonas wrote.

Jonas added that there seems to be a shift in how Musk has addressed the SpaceX-Tesla speculation in the past year.

During a conference call in August 2016, Musk said, ""I don't think there's a strong product rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla"" and added that while the companies cooperate, ""it's not enough that would justify merging them into one entity.""

Fast forward to August of this year though and Musk said the ""cross-fertilization of knowledge from the rocket and spacecraft history to auto...has really been quite valuable"" and it's helped him think about how Tesla can better make mass-market vehicles.

When Elon Musk isn't creating electric cars or scheming to send humans to Mars, the entrepreneur is attempting to cure Los Angeles of its traffic problems.

On Twitter, Musk recently shared an image of a tunnel in L.A. from The Boring Company, part of a plan to create an underground transportation system.

Musk said the tunnel is 500 feet so far, reaching two miles long in about 3 to 4 months. The goal is to stretch along Interstate 405 from Los Angeles International Airport to U.S. Route 101 in a year.

According to its website, the goal of The Boring Company is to alleviate ""soul-destroying traffic"" by building a high-speed transportation system.

""A large network of tunnels many levels deep would fix congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew,"" read a statement from The Boring Company.

In May, Musk revealed the company began boring a passage underneath Los Angeles.

The Boring Company website notes another benefit to the tunnels is faster adoption of Hyperloop, a transportation system designers once promised could move travelers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes.

While Musk created the idea of Hyperloop, he tasked other entrepreneurs to design and test the concept. Earlier this month, Virgin Group, led by billionaire Richard Branson, said it was investing in startup Hyperloop One.

Along with Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company, Musk also runs SolarCity, which recently helped restore power to The Children's Hospital in Puerto Rico.

We’ve known for months now that Musk’s cleverly named tunnel-digging venture has been testing equipment and technology beneath SpaceX’s Hawthorne, California headquarters and elsewhere in the LA suburb, after the city granted the company a test permit back in August. But this is the first image Musk has shared of what looks like a fully built out underground system similar to what the entrepreneur first unveiled earlier this year in a concept video.

The Boring Company was founded as an experimental effort in alternative urban transportation, with Musk envisioning a series of underground roadways that ferry vehicles to and from destinations using electric tracks. It’s effectively a high-speed subway exclusively for cars. Musk has picked LA as the testing ground both because he works in nearby Hawthorne and because the city’s notorious traffic jams gives the Boring Company a clear-sighted target.

The goal is to reduce congestion and speed up travel times, similar in concept and execution to Musk’s supersonic hyperloop concept. Except while the hyperloop remains only an idea of Musk’s that other third-party companies are trying to bring to life, Musk himself has built out the Boring Company from the get go to really test the viability of the idea and lay the initial groundwork for an underground LA system.

In a post to his personal Instagram containing the same photo, Musk describes this section of the LA tunnel as running parallel to Interstate 405 all the way to Interstate 101, with exit ramps “every mile or so.” Musk writes that “it will work like a fast freeway, where electric skates carrying vehicles and people pods on the main artery travel up to 150 mph, and the skates switch to side tunnels to exit and enter.”"

On Saturday, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO posted the first glimpse of a mostly finished portion of the Boring Company’s test site in California. Said tunnel looks pretty legit by tunnel standards, with cabling, paneled walls, what looks like ventilation, and some kind of track—it’s unclear whether it’s intended to carry construction equipment or prototype vehicles, but it does look far too small to carry the Boring Company’s monstrous Godot drill.

In a subsequent tweet, Musk expressed his desire to keep on boring until the tunnel stretches from the airport to U.S. Route 101, which would be quite a feat as the proposed route would require drilling through Santa Monica, Brentwood or possibly Beverly Hills.

The portion shown off above is “500 ft so far,” he wrote. “Should be 2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole 405 N-S corridor from LAX to the 101 in a year or so.”

Musk was originally restricted to tests on SpaceX company grounds, but received the go-ahead to begin digging the tunnel further from the Hawthorne City Council in August.

Musk’s stated end goal is to build a vast network of tunnels zipping with electrically powered sleds carrying both passenger cars and possibly some form of small people mover at 125 miles per hour, in theory diverting some of L.A.’s infamous gridlock into a faster secondary transportation grid. But he’s also been up front that the Boring Company is sort of just a cool experiment inspired by his woes with traffic.

Even if that experiment is successful, building it on the massive scale shown in his concept videos would require tearing up huge stretches of the city, and thus beating an unfriendly regulatory environment, not to mention billions of dollars in funding.

We’ve asked the Boring Company for some more info, including just what that track is intended to carry, and will update this post if we hear back.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave the public a glimpse of his tunnel under Los Angeles this weekend.

Musk posted a photo on Saturday showing the tunnel dug by the Boring Company, the serial entrepreneur's latest venture. Musk's ultimate goal for the city of LA is to build a network of tunnels that can transport cars and help alleviate traffic in the most-congested US city.

Musk said the tunnel is currently 500-feet long but should stretch two miles in four months. The tunnel is being dug in SpaceX's parking lot at the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard and Rocket Road in Los Angeles.

The Boring Company was granted approval in August by the city of Hawthorne, California, to dig the tunnel so it could prove its electric skate technology. The company wants to build an electric skate that can rocket cars through the tunnel, like so:

So far, the tunnel can only be used for research and development; once the Boring Company has finished testing the electric skate, the city of Hawthorne can request that the Boring Company refill its hole. The company is seeking approval to extend the tunnel under Interstate 405 of Los Angeles International Airport.

The Boring Company is also pursuing projects in Chicago and along the East Coast.

The company was granted state approval to dig a 10.3-mile tunnel beneath the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. It would be the first leg of a Hyperloop system that would extend from Baltimore to New York with stops in Washington and Philadelphia.

A Hyperloop is a nascent transit system that experts say could transport people in pods at speeds exceeding 200 mph."

Morris,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk went decidedly low-brow in an exchange with transportation experts on Friday, following reports of comments in which Musk called public transport a “pain in the ass” and suggested the subway was a great place to bump into a murderer.

The fracas began when Wired on Thursday published comments made by Musk at an artificial intelligence conference earlier this month. Musk said that “public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn’t leave where you want it to leave, doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end?”

Musk further said that using public transit meant rubbing shoulders with “like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer. . . that’s why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.”

A Boring Company spokesman sought to clarify to Wired that Musk was criticizing current public transit systems, not the concept of public transit as such. Musk’s ambition, which he’s pursuing through projects including The Boring Company, is to replace subways and buses with autonomous, individualized ‘pods’ to take riders precisely where they want to go, on demand.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Musk described the report as “misleading and misanthropic,” saying his comments were a “brief digression.”

But critics pounced on Musk’s description of shared transit as an unpleasant safety risk, arguing that Musk’s views were elitist, and that his vision of individualized transit is a pipe dream.

Jarrett Walker, a prominent public transit advocate and consultant, entered the fray by describing Musk’s disdain for public transit as “a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford,” and accusing him, in essence, of attempting to impose his phobia of strangers on everyone.

In cities, @elonmusk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford. Letting him design cities is the essence of elite projection. https://t.co/gtSVgPkfPo https://t.co/CmCpoIJ5NE — Jarrett Walker (@humantransit) December 14, 2017

Musk swiftly tweeted a terse reply to Walker: “You’re an idiot.”

You’re an idiot — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 15, 2017

The exchange triggered a broader Twitter debate about Musk’s opinions on transit, with much of the discourse coming from city planners and urbanists who have long eyed Musk’s dream of individualized transit with suspicion.

Walker, in his summary of the incident, pointed out that “the company of ‘random strangers’ is what a city is.”

One self-described transit advocate even said he had sold his Tesla shares in response to Musk’s comment."
https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/,pos,1.0,3.200139536748327e-20,Elon Musk Reveals His Dislike for Public Transit,2017-12-14 11:00:00,2019-06-24 14:47:28.413668,Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"Elon Musk is a man of many, many interests. Lately, to go along with cars, space, and AI, he has added mass transit to the pile. After launching the Boring Company last year (via a Twitter musing about terrible Los Angeles traffic), the Tesla and SpaceX CEO began digging an experimental tunnel in his own backyard, the parking lot of SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.

He plans, he says, to construct networks of tunnels throughout cities with faster, more efficient boring technology. The tunnels could carry individual cars or eight- to sixteen-passenger ""pods"" on electric skates, traveling up to 150 mph. (Longer tunnels, between cities, would be perfect for hyperloop, another interest.)

Less than a year after its founding, the Boring Company is already talking about taking its mass transit solution to real, live cities. In July, Musk announced that he had “verbal government approval” to build a hyperloop between Washington, DC and New York City, which could carry commuters between the two in less than 30 minutes. (A White House official later suggested that he had, perhaps, given Musk the wrong idea, and that the project had not been approved, verbally or otherwise.) In November, Musk said the company would bid on a project to build a new, faster rail link between downtown Chicago and O’Hare Airport. And in early December, the Boring Company released a map showing a proposed tunnel network in Los Angeles, which could transport both private cars and shared pods between Long Beach Airport in the south, Santa Monica in the west, Dodger Stadium in the east, and Sherman Oaks in the north.

All of which casts a curious light on the fact that last week, Musk revealed he's no great fan of mass transit. The whole sharing space with other humans thing? It's kind of icky.

“There is this premise that good things must be somehow painful,” he said onstage at a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference in Long Beach, California, in response to an audience question about his take on public transit and urban sprawl. “I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn’t leave where you want it to leave, doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end? And it doesn’t go all the time.”

“It’s a pain in the ass,” he continued. “That’s why everyone doesn’t like it. And there’s like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that’s why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.”

When the audience member responded that public transportation seemed to work in Japan, Musk shot back, “What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn’t sound great.” The CEO reiterated his preference for individual transportation, ie, private cars. Preferably, a private Tesla. (Tesla offered those attending Musk's talk the chance to test drive a Model S.)

The Boring Company's proposed ""people pods"", which could carry up to 16 passengers through underground tunnels. The Boring Company

A question, then: Does a public transit builder actually have to love the idea of public transportation? Maybe not. But there's a reason residents of cities with struggling transit systems (like New York and Tampa) get mad when they realize the people overseeing those systems don't actually use them. How can someone fix problems they can't see?

A Boring Company spokesperson says Musk was criticizing today's public transportation systems, not the idea of mass transit itself, and also noted that the company isn't seeking public funding for its work. ""The point is that while mass transit is generally painful, it doesn’t have to be that way and it should be better,"" the spokesperson continued. ""That's why The Boring Company exists—to increase the happiness of both drivers and mass transit users by reducing traffic and creating an efficient and affordable public transportation system.""

There are problems with mass transit, and no doubt Musk, with his knack for innovative thinking, is a welcome presence in the field. But his comments last week didn't focus on the standard roster of travel problems, like delays, crime, and grime. Musk criticized the basic tenets of public transit, the compromises fundamental to a system that serves a community, like set routes, schedules, and the presence of other human beings.

To bust traffic in cities like Los Angeles, Musk proposes to build a system of tunnels 30 to 40 layers below the ground, vast enough to carry all commuters with ease, even during peak rush hour. Transportation planners say this plan does not account for induced demand, the phenomenon where drivers take more and more trips to absorb unused road space. And tunnel engineers seriously doubt Musk can improve tunneling speeds at least 14 times over, as he has promised. ""What does Musk think, we’re all idiots?"" one tunneling industry veteran told WIRED this summer.

Whatever Musk's feelings, the Boring Company has pressed forward on plans to build tunnels in Maryland, Chicago, and Los Angeles. (Musk boasted this week of selling 35,000 branded Boring Company hats, for $20 a pop—a tidy $700,000 in funding. His Twitter bio now reads “Hat Salesman”.) In October, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced the Boring Company had begun work on a hyperloop to connect Baltimore and Washington, DC. A spokesperson for Hogan’s office said the majority of the tunnels would be built under existing state highways, and that Maryland expected to pay very little for the infrastructure project.

Correspondence between the Boring Company and the Maryland Department of Transportation, obtained by WIRED via a records request, suggest Musk’s company plans to use pods in these tunnels. MDOT has granted the Boring Company a conditional permit to build two transportation tunnels underneath the Baltimore Washington Parkway, provided the company gives the state detailed ground settlement monitoring plans, tunnel segment drawings, and safety plans, among other documents. The tunnels will stretch 10.1 miles in all.

In Chicago, Musk plans to bid for the opportunity to construct a long-planned high-speed transit link between the downtown and O’Hare International Airport. Today, the trip takes about 40 minutes by train; Mayor Rahm Emanuel hopes to cut that time in half. Emanuel’s office did not reply to requests for comment on the city's plans with Musk.

Meanwhile, planning continues in Los Angeles County, home of the Boring Company, its experimental tunnel, and its twin tunnel boring machines, named Godot and Line-Storm. Last month, the boring operation filed an application with the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering to build a 6.5-mile, proof-of-concept tunnel between the San Fernando Valley and Westwood, a continuation of a two-mile route already under construction in Hawthorne. The Boring Company has said its Los Angeles tunnels could carry individual cars or pods on electric skates. A map released by the Boring Company shows ambitious tunneling plans criss-crossing throughout Los Angeles county.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told Forbes this summer that the city had “almost announced a partnership” between the Boring Company and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but that the plan was in a holding pattern as the company decided whether to bid on a Metro project. Garcetti’s office did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.

Musk does seem to be a fan of carsharing, if not actually sharing physical space with strangers. In his Master Plan Part Deux, a 2016 outline of what’s to come for electric car company Tesla, the inventor indicated he wants to launch his own car-sharing service. Once Teslas reach full autonomy, he wrote, their owners should be able to add their vehicles to a shared fleet and “have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost.” He says this scheme—“like AirBnB for your car”—could make private car ownership accessible to those with limited incomes. But a totally autonomous Tesla doesn't exist yet, though Musk promised one would make a hands-off trip across the United States by the end of this year. In the meantime, transit commuters, enjoy your cramming.

Want to raise $700,000 for your business? Follow Elon Musk's lead and sell some hats.

Earlier this year, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX apparently got really frustrated with Los Angeles traffic and tweeted that he wanted to dig some tunnels to alleviate the problem. Hence, The Boring Company was born. With this pet project, Musk aims to dig a 6.5-mile tunnel to prove the concept in Los Angeles, with plans for more extensive tunnels in the city to follow.

Sounds great, but digging tunnels requires approval from government officials, which may take a bit (that's not a drill joke).

There's no doubt in my mind that Musk is completely self-aware of his status as, let's be honest, a messiah-like figure among those who admire his business acumen and his potential to save the world. Perhaps that's why a man who can generate pre-orders with a tweet dropped this head bomb back in March.

So, while The Boring Company may have had a slow start on its primary mission of digging tunnels, it certainly has seen success as a merch company. Musk is aware of this and in on the joke.

Now, he's started boasting sales of said $20 hat, reporting the latest figure, as of Dec. 12, at 35,000. That's $700,000 in sales. (Presumably, the company keeps the profits after the cost of manufacturing and shipping the hats.) It's a smart and low-overhead fundraising idea for any company pre-launch to drum up intrigue, excitement and early adopters.

The money is a great start for the nascent Boring Company, but a drop in the bucket for Musk. After all, Tesla, according to Bloomberg data, burns through $480,000 an hour, or about $8,000 a minute.

In October 2014, Musk ignited a global discussion on the perils of artificial intelligence. Humans might be doomed if we make machines that are smarter than us, Musk warned. He called artificial intelligence our greatest existential threat.

Now he is hoping to harness AI in a way that will benefit society.

In a recent interview with the website waitbutwhy.com, Musk explained that his attempt to sound the alarm on artificial intelligence didn't have an impact, so he decided to try to develop artificial intelligence in a way that will have a positive affect on humanity.

So Musk, who is already the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), is now heading up a startup called Neuralink. The San Francisco outfit is building devices to connect the human brain with computers. Initially, the technology could repair brain injuries or cancer lesions. Quadriplegics may benefit from the technology.

But the most amazing and alarming implications of Musk's vision lie years and likely decades down the line. Brain-machine interfaces could overhaul what it means to be human and how we live.

Related: When Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos left everyone in their dust

Today, technology is implanted in brains in very limited cases, such as to treat Parkinson's Disease. Musk wants to go farther, creating a robust plug-in for our brains that every human could use. The brain plug-in would connect to the cloud, allowing anyone with a device to immediately share thoughts.

Humans could communicate without having to talk, call, email or text. Colleagues scattered throughout the globe could brainstorm via a mindmeld. Learning would be instantaneous. Entertainment would be any experience we desired. Ideas and experiences could be shared from brain to brain.

We would be living in virtual reality, without having to wear cumbersome goggles. You could re-live a friend's trip to Antarctica -- hearing the sound of penguins, feeling the cold ice -- all while your body sits on your couch.

But many technical hurdles remain. Musk believes it will be eight to 10 years before this kind of the technology will be ready to use by people without disabilities. Musk's companies have made a habit of achieving what seemed impossible. But he's also notorious for aggressive deadlines that his companies don't meet.

Neuralink told waitbutwhy.com that it would need to simulate one million brain neurons before a transformative brain-machine interface could be built. If current rates of progress hold, it won't reach that milestone until 2100.

Related: Investors call for Tesla changes. Musk tells them to buy Ford.

In the meantime, there are many reasons for humans to be wary of implanting a computer in their brain. Any digital technology can be hacked. Humans might be unwittingly turned into malicious agents for unsavory causes. Computers crash too. If the interface fails, that could imperil our physical health.

With a brain-machine interface recording our lives, all of our experiences would be stored in the cloud. Privacy would be threatened. Governments or others would have incentives to access that information and track behavior.

If our brains merge with machines, our thoughts would become indistinguishable from what we'd downloaded from the cloud. We could struggle to know if our beliefs and views came from personal experiences, or from what the internet sent to our brains. Humans would be putting enormous trust in the maker of the brain-machine interface to share good information with them.

As Musk sees it, our options are limited.

""We're going to have the choice of either being left behind,"" Musk told waitbutwhy.com, ""and being effectively useless, or like a pet."""

After weeks of anticipation, details on Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface company Neuralink have finally been revealed. In a detailed report on the website Wait But Why, Tim Urban recounts insights gleaned from his weeks meeting with Musk and his Neuralink team at their San Francisco headquarters. He offers an incredibly detailed and informative overview of both Musk’s latest venture and its place in humanity’s evolution, but for those of you interested in just the big picture, here’s what you really need to know about Neuralink.

Your Brain Will Get Another “Layer”

Right now, you have two primary “layers” to your brain: the limbic system, which controls things like your emotions, long-term memory, and behavior; and the cortex, which handles your complex thoughts, reasoning, and long-term planning. Musk wants his brain interface to be a third layer that will complement the other two. The weirdest thing about that goal may be that he thinks we actually already have this third layer — we just don’t have the best interface for it:

We already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you have your computer or your phone or your applications…The thing that people, I think, don’t appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg…If you leave your phone behind, it’s like missing limb syndrome. I think people—they’re already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything.

The goal of Neuralink, then, is eliminating the middleman and putting that power we currently have at our fingertips directly into our brains. Instead of one person using their phone to transmit a thought to another person (“Dinner at 8?”), the thought would just go from one brain to the other directly.

Thankfully, we’ll be able to control this completely, Musk tells Urban: “People won’t be able to read your thoughts — you would have to will it. If you don’t will it, it doesn’t happen. Just like if you don’t will your mouth to talk, it doesn’t talk.”

Musk Is Working with Some Very Smart People

Musk met with more than 1,000 people before deciding on the eight who would help him shape the future of humanity at Neuralink. He claims assembling the right team was a challenge in and of itself, as he needed to find people capable of working in a cross-disciplinary field that includes everything from brain surgery to microscopic electronics.

The crew he landed is a veritable supergroup of smarties. They have backgrounds from MIT, Duke, and IBM, and their bios include phrases like “neural dust,” “cortical physiology,” and “human psychophysics.” They’re engineers, neurosurgeons, and chip designers, and if anyone can bring Elon Musk’s vision to life, it’s them.

The Timeline For Adoption Is Hazy…

Neuralink won’t come out the gate with a BMI that transforms you into a walking computer. The first product the company will focus on releasing will be much more targeted. “We are aiming to bring something to market that helps with certain severe brain injuries (stroke, cancer lesion, congenital) in about four years,” said Musk.

“ I think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability.” – Musk

The same way SpaceX was able to fund its research on reusable rockets by making deliveries to the ISS or Tesla was able to use profits from its early car sales to fund battery research, these earliest BMIs to treat diseases or the disabled will keep Neuralink afloat as it works on its truly mind-bending technologies.

As for when those technologies, the ones that allow healthy people to channel their inner telepaths, will arrive, Musk’s fairly optimistic timeline comes with several contingencies: “I think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability…It is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities.”

…Because The Hurdles are Many

Those are just two of the hurdles Neuralink faces. Elon Musk might make innovation look easy, but even going to Mars seems relatively straightforward in comparison to his plans for his latest company.

First, there are the engineering hurdles to overcome. The company has to deal with the problems of biocompatibility, wirelessness, power, and — the big one — bandwidth. To date, we’ve never put more than roughly 200 electrodes in a person’s brain at one time. When talking about a world-changing interface, the Neuralink team told Urban they were thinking something like “one million simultaneously recorded neurons.” Not only would they need to find a way to ensure that the brain could effectively communicate with that many electrodes, they also need to overcome the very practical problem of where to physically put them.

The engineering is only half the battle, though. Like Musk mentioned, regulatory approval will be a big factor in the development and adoption of Neuralink’s tech. The company also faces potential skepticism and even fear from a public that doesn’t want anyone cutting into their brains to install some high-tech machinery — according to a recent Pew survey, the public is even more worried about brain computer interfaces than gene editing. There’s also the not-entirely-unfounded fear that these computers could be hacked.

Add to all that our still very, very incomplete understanding of how the brain ticks exactly, and you can see that the Neuralink team has its work cut out for them.

Neuralink Won’t Exist in a Vacuum

Thankfully, they won’t be working to remake our minds alone — many other universities and research institutes are pushing brain interface technology forward. Facebook’s Building 8 is working on its own BCI, MIT is creating super-thin wires for use in brain implants, and other cyborg devices are already in the works to help the paralyzed walk again and the blind regain their sight. Each new development will push the field forward, and the team at Neuralink will be able to learn from the mistakes and successes of others in the field.

Just like other electric cars were on the road before Tesla came along, brain computer interfaces are not new — the tech might just need a visionary like Musk to elevate it (and us) to the next level."

But instead of fearing A.I., Musk has another pan for fighting the robots: merging them with the human brain. “Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence,” he mused onstage at a conference in Dubai in February.

Musk isn’t waiting for someone else to develop the technology, however. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk was launching a brain-computer interface start-up called Neuralink, which is developing a “neural lace” technology that would involve “implanting tiny brain electrodes that may one day upload and download thoughts.” Not much was known about the start-up at the time; Neuralink had been registered as a medical- technology company last summer, but progress in the largely untested biotech space is slow-going, mostly because implanting anything in the brain involves invasive and potentially dangerous surgery.

Now, Musk has officially confirmed that Neuralink is real, and that he is serious about the technology. He’ll serve as C.E.O of the company., he told Tim Urban in an interview with Wait But Why published Thursday, placing his commitment to Neuralink on par with Tesla and SpaceX.

The company, Musk explained, will initially seek to treat people with disabilities, but eventually its goal will be to upend human language using brain interfaces. Instead of having to describe difficult-to-explain ideas, you could send a picture from your brain to someone else’s to explain it. “There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low-data rate called speech or typing,” Musk said, describing what he calls consensual telepathy. “If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person.” Medical applications to treat people with brain injuries or disabilities could be developed in the next four years, Musk says; for telepathy and non-medica uses, Musk says that depending on regulatory approval timing, it could be done in the next eight to 10 years.

Musk isn’t the only Silicon Valley billionaire exploring the potential for telepathic communication. At Facebook C.E.O Mark Zuckerberg’s F8 developer’s conference this week, the company hinted at its own plans for a brain-computer interface service for users with disabilities. “What if you could type directly from your brain?” Regina Dugan, who leads Facebook’s Building 8, a secretive hardware branch of the company, said at F8 on Wednesday. Facebook reportedly has 60 scientists and engineers working on silent-speech communications, creating technologies that would let its users type thoughts from their brains at 100 words per minute.

Investors in Musk’s other ventures may be wary of the 45-year-old technologist taking on another project. Musk is already trying to revolutionize space travel, start a colony on Mars, cover America’s roofs with solar panels, transform the electric grid, convert the world’s automobile infrastructure to electric, and build supersonic transportation systems—when he’s not entertaining harebrained schemes to bore underground tunnels in Los Angeles to solve the city’s traffic problem. Then again, Musk appears perfectly on track with the rest of his companies: Tesla, which recently acquired another Musk entity, SolarCity, is on a stock-market tear, making Tesla more valuable than Ford and putting Musk on track for a $1.4 billion windfall. SpaceX recovered from a launch-pad accident last year and recently relaunched and successfully landed a used rocket, marking a first in the history of spaceflight. And Musk still manages, somehow, to sleep six hours a night. Perhaps he was just getting bored."

In fact, he often revels in sharing his fails, which can involve spectacular explosions.

He's also seen his ventures face down imminent collapse, especially when the bottom fell out of the economy about a decade ago. But Tesla recovered to become one of the most valuable automakers and SpaceX is today an undeniable leader in commercial space-faring.

What inspires Musk to persevere time and again? Well, we know he's concerned about the impending energy and climate crises that confront humanity, hence his interest in renewable energy, zero-emission vehicles and moving us to Mars in case the planet can't be saved.

These concerns obviously motivate him, but what about the inspiration to continue on down such a long road filled with countless setbacks?

Turns out one surprising source is J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings.""

When one young student from India asked Musk via Twitter how the classic tome filled with hobbits, orcs, wizards and elves inspired him, the serial executive was quick to respond with his takeaway from the epic tale of adventure:

""Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter.""

Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 20, 2017

In a way it's comforting to know that even billionaires often feel they're walking into oblivion, but Musk also knows the feeling of making it through to the other side, just like some certain hairy-footed heroes."

Saturday on Reddit, Elon Musk took to Reddit to join a massive internet audience in an AMA (ask me anything) questions thread to follow up on his International Aeronautical Congress (IAC) 2017 presentation. While Musk is typically candid and open about the progress of his various endeavors, he dedicated the AMA time and space to take questions specifically related to the IAC presentation — namely, what SpaceX is working on. As such, most of the questions users posed (and the ones he answered) were of a technical nature, though the mood was still lighthearted.

Rocket Science

One of the first questions, collected on the r/SpaceX subreddit leading up to the AMA, was about the Raptor’s thrust. It was one of the highest ranked questions at the AMA’s outset, and the first Musk answered.

Another question wondered just how the dry mass and thrust of the rockets would affect their return to Earth — namely, whether they would land by “hover-slam.” Musk responded that “Landing will not be a hoverslam,” and explained that the thrust to weight ratio will actually “feel quite gentle” and that as the ratio of thrust to weight at launch (also around 1.3) it will “pretty much look like a launch in reverse. . .”

Musk also provided some insight into the design of the rockets, and gave some context as to their design’s function and purpose. When one user asked about how the BFS will manage the temperature of propellents in zero gravity, Musk explained the venting procedure — adding that a cryocooler could be added in the future.

When user CMDR-Owl asked about what progress we’ll see in terms of development and testing over the next five or so years before SpaceX’s first planned launch, Musk explained that they’ll be starting “with starting with a full-scale Ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance,” adding that:

Next step will be doing orbital velocity Ship flights, which will need all of the above. Worth noting that BFS is capable of reaching orbit by itself with low payload, but having the BF Booster increases payload by more than an order of magnitude. Earth is the wrong planet for single stage to orbit. No problemo on Mars.

3D printing has already become beneficial to many industries, and naturally the question or whether it will benefit rocket production was a good one to ask. Musk responded that although most of the Raptor’s parts will be machine forged, some could be 3D printed.

Life on Mars

Speaking on life on Mars, while the focus was mainly on the rocket technology that will get us to there (and potentially elsewhere), users did have questions about what SpaceX needs to do to ensure that when we get to the Red Planet, we’ll be able to survive. Reddit user foxyjim99 asked about considerations such as food (namely, how you would calculate the amount needed for a mission and ensure that the need is met) — vitally important, but admittedly not something that SpaceX has as a primary focus. Musk responded that “Our goal is get you there and ensure the basic infrastructure for propellant production and survival is in place,” comparing the work that SpaceX is doing is roughly analogous to building “the equivalent of the transcontinental railway” — and as for terraforming Mars to make (and keep) it habitable, other companies and millions of people will need to be involved.

To that end, when user adammrxifgnqph asked if there were plans to send up additional satellites before the Mars mission, to facilitate communication, another user jumped in to ask about Mars-to-Earth communication. Musk’s response? “If anyone wants to build a high bandwidth comm link to Mars, please do.” Whether meant in jest, a challenge, or a call to action, user general-information pointed out that the concept interplanetary transmission is pretty cool. Musk responded to the user’s thoughts with an eloquent “Nerd,” but then offered a few more thoughts — ensuring us that when we go to Mars, we’ll probably be able to brag on social media about it.

The AMA was definitely a treat for those interested in the technical aspect of designing and building the rockets, but Musk didn’t keep it too serious:

Elon Musk is clearly not your typical CEO. Not only is he, through SpaceX, attempting feats of space travel and exploration never before attempted, but he’s communicating with the public about his efforts with a level of transparency that’s very atypical. There are some who think that Musk’s ambitious plans of getting to Mars within the near future are impossible — or at the very least, not probable. But whether or not SpaceX is able to accomplish exactly what they are intending, Elon Musk is proving that everyone is invited to be included in that process."

Morris,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed a trove of new details on the company’s plan to colonize Mars.

He discussed technical details about the giant rocket that he says will take passengers to the Red Planet, the road map for getting to its first launch, and insights into SpaceX’s broader strategy in an “Ask Me Anything” forum on Reddit Saturday.

Musk was his typical freewheeling self during the AMA, quoting the cartoon Bob the Builder and responding to a question about spaceship design with the highly technical insight that “tails are lame.”

He also gamely responded to questions about tangential details of settling Mars, including speculation that settlers might use a compressed version of the Internet. Musk observed that data would take between 3 and 22 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars. “So you could Snapchat, I suppose. If that’s a thing in the future,” he wrote.

More substantively, Musk clarified the scope of SpaceX’s ambitions on Mars. Though he has shared images of vast Martian cities in his presentations on Mars colonization, he said SpaceX isn’t focused on building those cities itself.

“Our goal is get you there and ensure the basic infrastructure for propellant production and survival is in place. A rough analogy is that we are trying to build the equivalent of the transcontinental railway. A vast amount of industry will need to be built on Mars by many other companies and millions of people.”

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

That means SpaceX will be designing and building things like systems for creating fuel from Martian resources, work that Musk said is “pretty far along.” But they won’t be focused on issues like how colonists grow food.

Musk also reiterated previous claims that SpaceX is designing the new Mars rocket – still code-named BFR, which stands for exactly what you think it does – to be as safe and reliable as today’s commercial airliners. That will be crucial if plans to use the BFR for transportation around Earth come to fruition.

Musk also shared some details about the game plan for testing the BFR ahead of its first scheduled flight in 2022.

“[We] will be starting with a full-scale Ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers in altitude and lateral distance,” Musk wrote. “Those are fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don’t need the high area ratio, deep space Raptor engines.

“[The] next step will be doing orbital velocity Ship flights, which will need all of the above.”

SpaceX’s progress on its Falcon 9 rocket in recent years – especially its unprecedented success in landing and reusing rockets – has fascinated observers and re-energized public dialogue about space."

Here are the highlights of the Q&A.

SpaceX plans to put satellites around Mars before any manned mission

Musk’s talk at IAC a few weeks ago raised a lot of eyebrows — the rumored BFR, or “Big Fucking Rocket,” was documented at least in concept, as was a plan for colonizing Mars. But while the rosy hued predictions of a massive city resupplied by countless rockets was compelling, there’s a lot that has to happen first.

One step is putting SpaceX orbiters around Mars to collect the kind of specific data the company needs in order to do repeated landings. Asked if he has plans to launch multiple such satellites, Musk merely replied “yes,” confirming speculation but obviously not much more.

Considering the short timeline SpaceX is operating on in terms of crewed Mars missions, these satellites would likely have to be launched in the next couple years, well before a full-scale test of the BFR platform.

We need an interplanetary internet

Several users asked about problem of information exchange: often at more than 20 light-minutes away, Mars wouldn’t be easy to browse the web from.

After calling a user a nerd for fantasizing about the possibility of a space internet, Musk agreed that a new protocol or system would be necessary. Probably, he speculated, users on Mars would request websites or media and it would have to be relayed over a sort of interplanetary backbone to caching systems on or around the red planet.

At nearer distances it wouldn’t be quite such a problem. “3 light-minutes at closest distance,” Musk wrote. “So you could Snapchat, I suppose. If that’s a thing in the future.”

SpaceX “chickened out” on Raptor thrust

The Raptor engines that are being tested for interplanetary trips were once slated to have about 300 tons of thrust force, but reduced later to 170. One user asked why this was the case. Musk first answered simply that “we chickened out.”

In a more detailed follow-up answer, however, he explained that first, they were able to do so because the payload mass had decreased. But large, complex engines capable of major throttling put too many eggs in one basket, he implied; smaller engines capable of many stages of throttling are better for fiddly operations like vertical landings. They’ll be mostly forged, not 3D printed.

The company is focusing on reliability above all, he wrote in answer to a related question:

The flight engine design [compared with existing test versions] is much lighter and tighter, and is extremely focused on reliability. The objective is to meet or exceed passenger airline levels of safety. If our engine is even close to a jet engine in reliability, has a flak shield to protect against a rapid unscheduled disassembly and we have more engines than the typical two of most airliners, then exceeding airline safety should be possible.

Test flights for on-planet travel are planned

Some found Musk’s idea of using rockets to go from point to point on Earth rather unrealistic, but hey, why not at least try it? Musk said that full scale tests will begin in the next couple years, first with rockets staying low (a couple hundred kilometers) and eventually working their way up to orbital flights.

He noted that multiple rocket stages will be continue to be necessary, at least on this planet: “Earth is the wrong planet for single stage to orbit. No problemo on Mars.”

There’s a “kinda weird” space tanker coming

In the IAC presentation, Musk showed two BFRs refueling by putting their engine ends together and having fuel flow between them.

At first, Musk explained, the BFR tankers will just be the same thing as passenger and cargo versions of the craft, but without a payload in the front. But the company is working on dedicated tanker craft with “an extremely high full to empty mass ratio” — by which he means they’ll be mostly empty space.

“Warning: it will look kinda weird,” he added.

To explain Musk’s success, others have pointed to his heroic work ethic (he regularly works 85-hour weeks), his ability to set reality-distorting visions for the future, and his incredible resilience.

But all of these felt unsatisfactory to me. Plenty of people have these traits. I wanted to know what he did differently.

As I kept reading dozens of articles, videos, and books about Musk, I noticed a huge piece of the puzzle was missing. Conventional wisdom says that in order to become world-class, we should only focus on one field. Musk breaks that rule. His expertise ranges from rocket science, engineering, physics, and artificial intelligence to solar power and energy.

In a previous article, I call people like Musk “expert-generalists” (a term coined by Orit Gadiesh, chairman of Bain & Company). Expert-generalists study widely in many different fields, understand deeper principles that connect those fields, and then apply the principles to their core specialty.

Based on my review of Musk’s life and the academic literature related to learning and expertise, I’m convinced that we should all learn across multiple fields in order to increase our odds of breakthrough success.

The jack of all trades myth

If you’re someone who loves learning in different areas, you’re probably familiar with this well-intentioned advice:

“Grow up. Focus on just one field.”

“Jack of all trades. Master of none.”

The implicit assumption is that if you study in multiple areas, you’ll only learn at a surface level, never gain mastery.

The success of expert-generalists throughout time shows that this is wrong. Learning across multiple fields provides an information advantage (and therefore an innovation advantage) because most people focus on just one field.

For example, if you’re in the tech industry and everyone else is just reading tech publications, but you also know a lot about biology, you have the ability to come up with ideas that almost no one else could. Vice-versa. If you’re in biology, but you you also understand artificial intelligence, you have an information advantage over everyone else who stays siloed.

Despite this basic insight, few people actually learn beyond their industry

Each new field we learn that is unfamiliar to others in our field gives us the ability to make combinations that they can’t. This is the expert-generalist advantage.

One fascinating study echoes this insight. It examined how the top 59 opera composers of the 20th century mastered their craft. Counter to the conventional narrative that success of top performers can solely be explained by deliberate practice and specialization, the researcher Dean Keith Simonton found the exact opposite: “The compositions of the most successful operatic composers tended to represent a mix of genres…composers were able to avoid the inflexibility of too much expertise (overtraining) by cross-training,” summarizes University of Pennsylvania researcher Scott Barry Kaufman in a Scientific American article.

Musk’s “learning transfer” superpower

Starting from his early teenage years, Musk would read through two books per day in various disciplines according to his brother, Kimbal Musk. To put that context, if you read one book a month, Musk would read 60 times as many books as you.

At first, Musk’s reading spanned science fiction, philosophy, religion, programming, and biographies of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. As he got older, his reading and career interests spread to physics, engineering, product design, business, technology, and energy. This thirst for knowledge allowed him to get exposed to a variety of subjects he had never necessarily learned about in school.

Musk is also good at a very specific type of learning that most others aren’t even aware of — learning transfer.

Learning transfer is taking what we learn in one context and applying it to another. It can be taking a kernel of what we learn in school or in a book and applying it to the “real world.” It can also be taking what we learn in one industry and applying it to another.

This is where Musk shines. Several of his interviews show that he has a unique two-step process for fostering learning transfer.

First, he deconstructs knowledge into fundamental principles

Musk’s answer on a Reddit AMA describes how he does that:

It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.

Research suggests that turning your knowledge into deeper, abstract principles facilitates learning transfer. Research also suggests that one technique is particularly powerful for helping people intuit underlying principles. This technique is called, “contrasting cases.”

Here’s how it works: Let’s say you want to deconstruct the letter “A” and understand the deeper principle of what makes an “A” an A. Let’s further say that you have two approaches you could use to do this:

Which approach do you think would work better?

Approach #1. Each different A in Approach #1 gives more insight into what stays the same and what differs between each A. Each A in Approach #2 gives us no insight.

By looking at lots of diverse cases when we learn anything, we begin to intuit what is essential and even craft our own unique combinations.

What does this mean in our day-to-day life? When we’re jumping into a new field, we shouldn’t just take one approach or best practice. We should explore lots of different approaches, deconstruct each one, and then compare and contrast them. This will help us uncover underlying principles.

Next, he reconstructs the fundamental principles in new fields

Step two of Musk’s learning transfer process involves reconstructing the foundational principles he’s learned in artificial intelligence, technology, physics, and engineering into separate fields:

In aerospace in order to create SpaceX

In automotive in order to create Tesla with self-driving features

In trains in order to envision the Hyperloop

In aviation in order to envision electric aircraft that take off and land vertically

In technology in order to envision a neural lace that interfaces your brain

In technology in order to help build PayPal

In technology in order to co-found OpenAI, a non-profit that limits the probability of negative artificial intelligence futures

Keith Holyoak, a UCLA professor of psychology and one of the world’s leading thinkers on analogical reasoning, recommends people ask themselves the following two questions in order to hone their skills: “What does this remind me of?” and “Why does it remind me of it?”

By constantly looking at objects in your environment and material you read and asking yourself these two questions, you build the muscles in your brain that help you make connections across traditional boundaries.

Bottom line: It’s not magic. It’s just the right learning process

Now, we can begin to understand how Musk has become a world-class expert-generalist:

He spent many years reading 60 times as much as an avid reader

He read widely across different disciplines

He constantly applied what he learned by deconstructing ideas into their fundamental principles and reconstructing them in new ways

At the deepest level, what we can learn from Musk’s story is that we shouldn’t accept the dogma that specialization is the best or only path toward career success and impact. Legendary expert-generalist Buckminster Fuller summarizes a shift in thinking we should all consider. He shared it decades ago, but it’s just as relevant today:

“We are in an age that assumes that the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable… In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual’s leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which in turn leads to war.”

If we put in the time and learn core concepts across fields and always relate those concepts back to our life and the world, transferring between areas becomes much easier and faster.

As we build up a reservoir of “first principles” and associate those principles with different fields, we suddenly gain the superpower of being able to go into a new field we’ve never learned before, and quickly make unique contributions.

Understanding Musk’s learning superpowers helps us gain some insight into how he could go into an industry that has been around for more than 100 years and change the whole basis of how the field competes.

Elon Musk is one of a kind, but his abilities aren’t magical.

https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/elon-musk-has-delivery-issues,pos,1.0,7.075527156438678e-24,Elon Musk Has Delivery Issues,2017-01-10 14:15:54,2019-06-24 14:47:42.790025,Jeffrey Rothfeder + Isaac Chotiner + Anna Shechtman + Lauren Collins + Masha Gessen + Charles Bethea + Levi Tillemann + Anthony Lydgate,"Just before President-elect Donald Trump met with leaders from Apple, I.B.M., Amazon, Facebook, and other tech companies in mid-December, the transition team made a somewhat puzzling announcement: Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity, who would be attending the session in Trump Tower, had been named to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a new committee intended to advise the President on economic policy. The appointment seemed odd chiefly because Musk’s political views—he has been pro-immigration and against the Keystone XL Pipeline while supporting a carbon tax on businesses and expressing passionate concern about climate change—would seem to veer far from Trump and his party. Still, whatever their ideological differences, Trump and Musk are not such an unlikely duo; they have many qualities in common. Both are outsized businessmen and public figures who have enjoyed hoopla and credulous press for their projects despite checkered records of success. Musk is best known as an innovator with unorthodox ideas. He created a car company from the ground up, building luxury electric cars with a devoted following. He jumped into solar energy and battery development on a big scale, vows to colonize Mars, and has said that we are probably living in a computer-simulated world. But, while his grand gestures inspire awe and curiosity, they often fall short in the execution. Since 2011, Tesla has failed to meet Musk’s product-launch, production, and financial-performance promises more than twenty times, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. Even a private showing, in early January, of Tesla’s new Gigafactory, in Storey County, Nevada—which Musk claims is on schedule to mass-produce lithium-ion batteries at rock-bottom costs by 2018—didn’t instill confidence in Musk’s ability to achieve his stated goals. As the Pacific Crest Securities research analyst Brad Erickson said in a note, the tour left ""much to the imagination."" And in September an explosion destroyed an unmanned SpaceX rocket on the launch pad during a fuelling exercise—an incident that called into question the viability of Musk’s radical notion to refuel craft en route, with astronauts on board. A little more than a year earlier, a NASA-funded SpaceX rocket carrying cargo destined for the International Space Station exploded two minutes after lift-off, destroying the payload. A NASA report on that incident raised questions about quality standards at Musk’s company. The first unmanned SpaceX flight since the September accident is scheduled for later this month. Musk, however, is nothing if not self-assured, a quality he brings to an upcoming task: he has promised to devise an entirely new system for making automobiles, with levels of efficiency and productivity that have never been achieved before. He intends to do this with something he calls a “machine that builds the machine,” a nearly fully automated factory that will assemble cars at speeds greater than any other global automaker. Beginning in 2018, this plant, an extension of Tesla’s current facility in Fremont, California, is slated to produce as many as half a million vehicles each year, and Musk has previously promised to increase output by some fifty per cent every year. This is an extraordinary leap in production: in 2016, Tesla produced fewer than eighty-four thousand cars. In the auto industry, Musk’s production assertions are viewed as the manufacturing equivalent of vaporware—an advance that is promised but has very little chance of becoming a reality. The most efficient automakers—companies such as Toyota and Honda that have spent decades studying, designing, and perfecting manufacturing systems and processes—are unable to approach anywhere near the levels of production that Tesla, which isn’t fifteen years old, is aiming for. Indeed, a prolific auto plant in the U.S., running three six-and-a-half-hour shifts a day, produces just more than four hundred thousand cars a year—and only if it operates at peak efficiency virtually all of the time, without interruptions to deal with parts shortages, incorrectly sized or mismatched components, or design changes. The disparity between real-world factory output and Musk’s goals likely means that many of the nearly four hundred thousand people who have already put down a thousand dollars to reserve a Tesla Model 3, which Tesla says will cost about thirty-five thousand dollars, will have to wait until 2019 or later for their cars. Even one of Tesla’s most stalwart supporters in the investment community, the Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, has reached the conclusion that the Model 3s will be late, and that there will be fewer of them than advertised. In November, he wrote, “We continue to forecast a Model 3 launch at the very end of 2018 (more than 1 year later than company target) with 60k units in 2019 and 130k units in 2020.”

Musk does not give many specifics about how he will produce so many cars, so quickly, in ways that have eluded his more experienced competitors. But he is unambiguous about one foundational principle: his ramp-up in production can come about only by eliminating humans from the manufacturing process as much as possible. “You really can't have people in the production line itself, otherwise you drop to people speed,” Musk said on an earnings call in August. In this context, it’s worth noting that the aim of the Trump advisory committee that Musk was appointed to is to figure out ways to “make it attractive for firms to create new jobs.” Musk’s plan for a fully automated, so-called “lights-out factory”—because robots can work in the dark—is a strategy many in the industry consider to be a short-sighted. Humans can help improve efficiency by identifying shortcomings and conceiving of ways to do things that will shave time and cost from manufacturing processes. “You grow into automation,” Jay Baron, president and C.E.O. of the Center for Automotive Research, told me. “You don’t start with it.” In one of his many public claims about his new plant, Musk expressed confidence that the assembly line would eventually move at about one metre per second, which Baron calculated as one car every fifteen seconds. Such a pace is twenty times the assembly line’s current speed—it’s an almost comical pace, and one that raises serious questions about what Tesla would have to sacrifice to maintain this speed on the line. There are upwards of thirty thousand components in a typical car, and while Teslas have fewer, because its electric-propulsion system is a bit simpler than a gasoline-powered engine, making them is still a complicated process. At the speeds that Musk is anticipating, it would be virtually impossible for Tesla’s network of suppliers to feed the assembly line with parts that meet high-quality standards without interruption. In addition, automakers budget a great deal of time to randomly inspect partially built cars for flaws and errors that could indicate larger problems with other vehicles on the line. Musk hasn’t yet addressed these contingencies, all of which will affect the safety of his vehicles, and Tesla declined to comment further. Although the company’s cars have been given high marks by Consumer Reports and Car and Driver for their on-road performance, Consumer Reports’ 2016 Annual Auto Reliability Survey ranked Tesla twenty-fifth out of twenty-nine brands. The magazine cited a slew of issues with the seventy-five-thousand-dollar (or more) Model X S.U.V. crossover, “including frequent malfunctions of the falcon-wing doors, water leaks, and infotainment and climate-control system problems.” Other concerning information has come out in recent months. As the Wall Street Journal reported, a design engineer for Tesla named Cristina Balan noticed in 2014 that Model S cars on the assembly line had an observable gap between the headliner (the material on the interior of the car’s roof) and the trim on the adjacent support pillar. Worried that other, more critical parts didn’t fit or meet tolerances, and upset that people were paying more than a hundred thousand dollars for shoddy workmanship, Balan told her managers and Musk about the problem. Over the next few months, Balan says she was demoted, harassed, and ultimately forced to quit—even though she had been so integral to the development of Tesla’s power system that her initials were engraved on each battery. Balan is now in arbitration with Tesla over her departure from the company. When Balan first left the company, she didn’t ask for severance pay or even that her sacrificed stock options be allowed to vest, but only for a private meeting with Musk, which was rejected. She told me, “I wanted to alert Elon, without lawyers or V.P.s present, that his company was in trouble. People are afraid of losing their jobs if they speak up and this will get worse as they try to mass-produce automobiles in a company that isn’t ready to do that.” Tesla denies that Balan was forced to quit over the issues she raised."

Not even the brightest minds in tech can escape one of Twitter's big faux pas: sending a direct message as a public tweet.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and potential candidate for real-world Tony Stark, sent a tweet out to John Carmack, who works as chief technology officer for VR company Oculus.

""Do you have a sec to talk,"" the tweet said with Musk's phone number.

There's one problem: it's clear the tweet was meant to be a private message. Instead, it was readily visible to Musk's 16.7 million Twitter followers.

The tweet was immediately deleted, but by then the number had spread.

CNBC called it, and got a greeting from game designer David Jaffe, who created the hit PlayStation series God of War. ""By the Gods you've done it,"" said the message, reports CNBC. ""Somehow you've found your way here to me. I offer you my congratulations and my respect.""

Both Musk and Carmack have experience in building rockets. Carmack once ran his own aerospace company, Armadillo Aerospace. Also, as Carmack pointed out on Twitter, he and Musk helped found the Commercial Spaceflight Foundation, to promote and pursue safe, commercial space travel.

Others pay attention to what he does and how he does it. And now, finally, they can call his cell number and experience a quirky bit of emotional intelligence.

Seriously. Not kidding. The reason is Musk's Twitter account. He's a regular user, but even a technically savvy person like Musk can make a blunder, and that's what he did. In the process of trying to reach John Carmack, chief technology officer at Facebook's virtual reality subsidiary Oculus, he openly posted his cell-phone number.

Musk quickly deleted the tweet, but with 16.7 million followers, not fast enough to keep someone from noticing and passing it on.

Most high-profile and well-off people likely would have immediately changed the number to avoid contact with the hoi polloi. And certainly, with multiple companies and outrageously big plans, Musk doesn't have time to spare for chitchat with several million of his nearest and dearest.

Instead, he displayed a sense of humor and recognition of his own limitations. When you dialed, the call went to voice mail, playing a copy of a hidden message from the video game God of War. The title has a couple of phone numbers hidden deep within the game play, each leading to a different message.

CNBC reporter Michelle Castillo called Musk's cell and heard something that began as follows: ""By the gods you've done it! Somehow you've found your way here to me. I offer you my congratulations and my respect.""

I haven't called his number directly so don't know how much of the message is left there. You can find out what the whole thing would say to game players by calling 1-888-447-5594 or listening to the copy (pretty funny in its own right) below:

No one is perfect, and the more adulation that surrounds you, the more you need to remember your own fallibility. Musk's mistake was as simple as prematurely hitting send on an email. He likely was on autopilot and forgot to check whether he was sending a direct message or an open tweet.

We've all done something similar and perhaps deleted the evidence, knowing how unlikely it was that someone else would preserve the moment. Musk didn't have that option.

But instead of hiding from the problem, he used humor--and time apparently spent playing video games--to leave the message on his old number. It was a case of emotional intelligence, understanding your own limitations and the reactions of others."

Richard Drew/AP

The Tesla CEO’s recent comments about public transportation triggered a firestorm of criticism. Here’s why.

Like many tech entrepreneurs, Elon Musk is trying to reinvent public transit. But his comments at an event last month, as reported by Aarian Marshall in Wired, made many people wonder whether he understands the business he’s trying to disrupt: “I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn’t leave where you want it to leave, doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end? And it doesn’t go all the time.” “It’s a pain in the ass,” he continued. “That’s why everyone doesn’t like it. And there’s like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that’s why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.” When the audience member responded that public transportation seemed to work in Japan, Musk shot back, “What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn’t sound great.” These comments ignited a firestorm of criticism from transit advocates (myself included), and some thin-skinned replies from Musk. Urban planning guru Brent Toderian quickly created the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedOnTransit, which is now gathering testimonials from people around the world about wonderful encounters they’d had with “a bunch of random strangers” on buses and trains. Elon Musk may say bad things about public transit, but I asked Twitter to share their #GreatThingsThatHappenedOnTransit! As usual, Twitter responded in spades. Here are some of my favourites for posterity - please enjoy & share! https://t.co/C55k9o0gKc — Brent Toderian (@BrentToderian) December 19, 2017 But Musk’s views need to be taken seriously, because many influential people share them. What’s more, many people view him as an expert on whatever topic he touches. If Musk is going to lead an urban transportation revolution, we must all understand the attitudes he brings to the project.

Musk expresses two of the most common complaints about big-city transit: “Transit doesn’t do exactly what I need it to do.”

“Transit requires sharing space with strangers, which is icky.” Note that these aren’t the usual complaints about “failing transit.” Instead, they attack transit for succeeding. Like an airline, an urban mass transit system doesn’t go to your door, and it doesn’t protect you from the company of strangers, and that’s exactly why it can offer cost-effective mobility to so many people. Effective transit doesn’t go to your door Musk complains that “transit doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end.” Of course, we all want to go from a specific point A to a specific point B at a given time. But in an efficient transit system there isn’t a service that does exactly that, because not many people want to do exactly that at a given time. Instead of doing exactly what you want, an efficient mass transit network is designed to do most of what thousands of people want. It is by being mostly useful to so many people that buses and trains attract lots of riders. And carrying lots of riders is how buses and trains deliver so much liberty and opportunity to citizens while taking so little space. To be elite is to be a minority, and it makes no business sense to design transit around elite tastes. If you’re really going to replace those services in a dense urban setting—as inventors have been trying to do for decades—you will need to match that efficiency in using scarce urban space. Musk’s “Loop” concept for relieving traffic congestion with a network of tunnels begins by moving people in small pods of 8 to 16 people (or in their own cars, riding aboard electric skates). Even if all the many technical and regulatory barriers could be overcome, this is a much less efficient use of space than subways are today. All those crash-safe walls between travelers take a lot of room. What’s more, a Boring Company video shows you driving your car into a parking space that becomes an elevator into a tunnel—an incredibly low-capacity use for valuable urban real estate. Whole city blocks would need to be leveled to provide enough elevators for everyone to do this at rush hour. Effective transit is crowded with strangers Musk doesn’t want to share a vehicle with “a bunch of random strangers.” But the presence of random strangers is what a city is, and what successful transit is. The unique achievement of transit is to transport so many people in so little space with so little labor. Crowding—however much it bothers some people—is the essence of transit’s success.

Overcrowding is something else. When a vehicle is so full that nobody can get on, that causes a denial of service, which is a bad thing. So transit systems want to be crowded but not overcrowded. They don’t want to leave passengers behind, and they do what they can to prevent that. This means that if you decide not to ride transit because it’s too crowded, somebody else will be happy to take your place there, delivering the same level of efficiency. So the only definition of “overcrowding” that matters is the one that prevails in the culture at large—the one that determines how much personal space people will give up to fit another person on board. Those famously packed Japanese subways and trains that Musk hates, for example, reflect a prevailing Japanese attitude on that question that differs from the American one. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... So Musk can imply that there’s something wrong with transit because it’s too crowded—an example of the Yogi Berra fallacy—but cities and transit agencies shouldn’t care. If they’re crowded, they’re succeeding. The danger of elite projection By now you may be thinking: Who cares about all this theory? Urban transit is too crowded by my standards! Or it’s not doing a good enough job of taking me where I want to go. This is where you have to decide if you want transit to have the greatest possible benefit to your entire city—in terms of displacing car trips and fostering inclusive prosperity—or whether it’s more important that it take care of you. The most common falsehood about transit, the one that underlies most of the comments transit agencies receive and many of the worst mistakes in transit planning, is this: “Transit would be better for everyone if it were better for me.” A special danger arises when relatively wealthy people take this view, demanding that expensive mass transit systems be designed according to their personal tastes. I call this mistake elite projection, and explore it here. Many poor transit investments have arisen from a too-small group of fortunate people assuming that everyone shares their tastes and priorities. They forget that to be elite is to be a minority, and it makes no business sense to design transit around elite tastes if what you really want are lots and lots of riders."

Taken out of context, Musk’s Thursday tweetstorm—which touched on all those subjects—might seem strange. But it all goes back to a fracas that erupted earlier this month after Wired published comments made by the CEO at an artificial intelligence conference. Musk said that “public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn’t leave where you want it to leave, doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end?”

Musk called the Wired report “misleading and misanthropic.” But that didn’t stop critics from lashing out at the billionaire entrepreneur’s description of shared transit as an unpleasant safety risk.

And that’s when things escalated.

Jarrett Walker, a high-profile public transit advocate and consultant, jumped into the debate, describing Musk as an elitist and calling his disdain for public transit as “a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford.”

Musk’s response was short—“You’re an idiot”—and it only poured more fuel on an already fiery debate.

After the initial eruption, all seemed quiet until NYT columnist and economist Paul Krugman retweeted out a story from Fortune with one comment “Elon Musk’s idea of a cogent argument, ‘You’re an idiot.'”

It took a couple of days, but Musk fired back with a string of tweets explaining his reasoning, and declaring his love for some public transit.

Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 21, 2017

I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 21, 2017

Later, Musk took things officially too far.

For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 21, 2017

Still, Musk says public transit doesn’t fully solve the problem “as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight.”

However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 21, 2017

The upshot? Tunnels. Multi-level tunnels. Which is what his other business, The Boring Company, just happens to be pursuing."

His approach was documented by his Caltech colleague David Goodstein in the book Feynman’s Lost Lecture about physics classes Feynman taught in the 1960s:

Once, I said to him, “Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.” Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.” But he came back a few days later to say, “I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t really understand it.”

Feynman didn’t mean all human knowledge must be distilled into an introductory college course. His point was that we need to build our grasp of science and technology from the ground up if we are to master it, not to mention reimagine how it works. Feynman was famous as a student for redoing many of physics’ early experiments himself to build a foundational understanding of the field. By mastering these first principles, Feynman often saw things that others did not in quantum mechanics, computing, and nuclear physics, earning him the Nobel Prize in 1965.

Elon Musk’s companies approach problems in a similar way. Whether it’s reaching Mars or boring tunnels through the earth, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX loves to talk about basic math. On investor calls and press conferences, Musk often muses on the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of what he’s trying to do.

Bret Hartman / TED Musk runs the numbers at the TED conference on April 28.

Take The Boring Company, Musk’s latest “hobby” aimed at banishing Los Angeles’ snarled traffic. On Apr 28, at a TED conference, Musk explained his proposal to deploy continuous tunnel-boring machines that link cities through a network of deep underground tunnels. The company’s promotional video shows vehicles zipping along city streets before stopping on car-sized elevators built into the pavement. Underground tracks whisk them off to their destination at speeds of more than 130 miles per hour (200 kilometers per hour) before depositing them back at the surface to finish the last leg of their journey. He wants to do all this for one-tenth of today’s costs compared to the estimated $1 billion per mile price tag for Los Angeles’ new subway extension.

To illustrate his idea, Musk did some back-of-the-envelope calculations outlining “a straightforward series of steps:”dig narrower tunnels with faster machines that drill continuously rather than the slow, manual and often inefficient methods used today. His of the math is summarized below:

1 ""If you just do two things you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement, and then go beyond that. The first thing to do is cut the tunnel diameter by 2 times or more. A single road tunnel has to be 26 to 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars. But if you shrunk it to 12 feet, what we're attempting, which is plenty for a skate to get through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area by a factor of 4. The tunnel costs scales with the cross-sectional area. That's roughly half an order of magnitude improvement right there. Then, tunneling machines tunnel half time and then stop and the rest of the time is reinforcements for the tunnel walls. If you design the machine to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing, that will give you a factor of two improvement. Combine that, and it's a factor of 8. Also these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limit. I think you can get a factor of two, maybe even four or five on top of that. There’s a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in cost per mile. Our target actually is that we have pet snail named Gary from....Sponge Bob Square Pants. Gary is capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel boring machine. We want to beat Gary.""

First, dig a smaller tunnel. Replacing a typical subway tunnel (about 28 feet across) with one half that size (14 feet across) reduces the area by a factor of four (since area = π x radius2). Since tunnel costs are correlated with area, a $1 billion tunnel could now cost roughly $250 million.

Noah Berger / MTA A San Francisco subway tunnel.

Second, speed it up. Tunneling machines today work half the time and then stop for reinforcement of tunnel walls. Musk proposes continuous tunneling and reinforcing (which is not yet possible), cutting costs in half again. A hypothetical tunnel would then cost about $125 million.

WSDOT Tunnel segments for a Seattle highway tunnel.

Finally, drill faster. Today’s boring machines are nowhere near their “power or thermal limits.” That, he estimates, would cut costs by as much as five-fold. Now a $1 billion tunnel costs something more like $60 million (or even $25 million in an optimistic scenario).

WSDOT

Does it all add up? “Nothing is impossible, but all of it is very difficult,” says Gregory Hauser, a civil engineer at Dragados who recently managed the replacement of Seattle’s Alaskan Way Viaduct, the largest underground highway project in the US. “I think [The Boring Company] is on par with SpaceX.” Hauser said Musk’s calculations elide serious technical complexities, and today’s technologies are not up to the job. But after 40 years of incremental innovation, most of it from outside the US, “I’m all for it,” he said. “The industry needs new thinking and technology.”

Executing on these ideas will require the world’s most advanced engineering, but spotting unexpected solutions just takes an uncommon clarity of mind. It’s a trick Musk has repeated at each of his companies. Musk described behind Tesla’s manufacturing technology at the company’s 2016 annual meeting: reconfigure today’s inefficient factories.

2 I actually think the potential for improvement in the machine that makes the machine is a factor of 10 greater than the potential on the car side. I think maybe more than a factor of 10. I’ve really come to appreciate that over the last two to three months when I’ve been on the production floor all the time and running production personally at a detailed level. I don’t even have a desk or an office Im just standing on the production floor….. You can think of its as designing a modern system on chip or computer…..There’s crazy potential for improvement here on production with significantly less en engineering effort we can make dramatic improvements in the machine that makes the machine.I think a lot of people will not believe us about this but I’m absolutely confident that this can be accomplished. You design a factory like you design an advanced computer. Once you explain this to a first-rate engineer, the light bulb goes on…..They spend huge amounts of effort trying to get fractions of percent of improvement on the product itself but actually the same amount of effort yields orders of magnitude more results if you focus on building the machine the builds the machine. Lot of engineers don’t realize this is possible. They think there’s like a wall. They’re basically operation according to these invisible walls and we’re in the the process of explains those walls don’t exist and I think it’s going to be pretty amazing.

“The most important point I want to make is [that] the true problem, the true difficulty, and where the greatest potential lies is building the machine that makes the machine. In other words, building the factory … like a product,” said Musk at the annual meeting (starting at 2:20), predicting a new factory would deliver a “ten-fold improvement” in productivity.

His solution? ”I do my favorite thing which is apply physics first principles,” he said. “It’s like the best tool possible.”

This time the factory was reduced to a different equation: output = volume x density x velocity. Need to bring down the cost of batteries? Fill as much of the factory’s volume possible with equipment. Instead of using 3% of the volumetric space, Tesla plans to use at least 30% to get more production per unit of space. Need to produce 500,000 cars per year rather than the 50,000 Tesla has managed so far? Speed up the assembly line by a factor of seven from its typical 0.2 meters per second to 1.5 meters per second. Then build factories as a series of mini facilities, each one iterating on the design of the last so incremental improvements can be rolled out to Tesla’s battery, solar panel, and car plants.

Reuters/James Glover II Building a better battery.

SpaceX seems to have sprung from the same thinking. The moment of SpaceX’s conception is not documented, but Ashlee Vance’s book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future comes close. On a flight back from Moscow after the Russians dismissed Musk’s offer to buy retooled intercontinental ballistic missiles, Musk was furiously crunching numbers on his laptop. As the plane ascended, Vance recounted the moment when Musk’s companions on the flight, two aerospace engineers, first saw the spreadsheet laying out how he planned to build a cheaper, faster rocket:

Musk wheeled around and flashed a spreadsheet he’d created. “Hey, guys,” he said, “I think we can build this rocket ourselves.” “We’re thinking, Yeah, you and whose fucking army,” [SpaceX founding team member Jim] Cantrell said “But, Elon says, ‘No, I’m serious. I have this spreadsheet.’” Musk passed his laptop over to [future NASA administrator] Mike Griffin and Cantrell, and they were dumbfounded. The document detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk’s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. The spreadsheet also laid out the hypothetical performance characteristics of the rocket in fairly impressive detail. “I said, ‘Elon, where did you get this?’” Cantrell said. Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he’d borrowed Rocket Propulsion Elements, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, and Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion, along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made much cheaper than what the Russians were offering.

This is not to say Musk will realize his most ambitious goals: landing on Mars, electrifying much of the world’s transportation fleet, and accelerating the transition from a fossil-fuel to a carbon-free economy. But each is closer than most thought possible in such a short time. The seed of each idea was planted by calculating what physics dictates is possible, not extrapolating from the status-quo. This defined the arena of possibility using little more than high-school math.

Musk is trying to spread the word. He explained his thinking to Tesla’s shareholders as it applied to the design of the Gigafactory in 2016. Instead of extracting tiny gains in the design of the car (a highly-engineered product where most cost and material savings were squeezed out long ago), Musk turned his attention to the factory where he said the same amount of effort yielded an order of magnitude more results.

“Once you explain this to a first-rate engineer, the light bulb goes on,” said Musk. “Lot of engineers don’t realize this is possible. They think there’s like a wall. They’re basically operating according to these invisible walls and we’re in the process of explaining those walls don’t exist. And I think it’s going to be pretty amazing.”"

And he wants you—especially if you are a NASA string-puller or deep-pocketed futurist—to help him get there.

Sporting Tony Stark facial hair, Musk outlined SpaceX's plan today at the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. It involves a slew of new technology: gigantic, reusable rockets; carbon fiber fuel tanks; ultra-powered engines. Plus spaceships capable of carrying a hundred or more passengers to the Red Planet, landing, then returning to Earth to pick up more. Musk doesn't just want to go to Mars: He wants to build a civilization there. Which means he'll need all that sweet gear to make it cheap enough to work.

By Musk's admittedly loose estimates, buying yourself a single ticket to Mars right now (using non-existent tech) would probably cost around $10 billion. The same amount of cash could buy you a few square blocks in Midtown Manhattan. But once the so-called SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System is fully operational, he estimates that a person will be able to travel to the Red Planet for around $200,000, roughly the same as a two-bedroom in Madison, Wisconsin. The ITS—Musk says the name needs some workshopping—would accomplish these cost cuts primarily with lighter materials, stronger rockets, and reusable technology.

Take a ride with Elon through his Martian fantasy. You and 99 or more other passengers board a huge crew vessel atop a massive new rocket—combined, they are about as tall as a 40-story building. Forty-two Raptor engines rumble to life below, and soon you and your fellow pilgrims are gunning through the upper atmosphere at tens of thousands of miles per hour. After depositing you in orbit, the first stage booster drops back to Earth, and flies itself back to the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. After some indeterminate refurbing, a crane attaches another spaceship on top. Except this one has no people. It's full of fuel. The rocket launches again, and releases the spaceship, which meets your spaceship in orbit and transfers its fuel load into your ship's tanks. Repeat a few times until your ship is topped off. Then, you head for Mars.

Thanks to six vacuum-optimized engines accelerating your ship to about 19,014 mph, you and the other pilgrims will reach Mars in just over three months. Along the way, you guys will have so much fun playing zero-G games, watching movies, hanging out in the on-board pizza shop. (Elon. Seriously.) ""It will be like, really fun to go, you’ll have a great time,"" Musk insists. (Several years of submarine service leave me slightly skeptical that any amount of pizza and zero-G can turn ""locked in a tube"" into a ""great time,"" but who cares, off to Mars!)

Upon arrival, heat shields on the ship's belly will create mild friction with Mars' scant atmosphere to help you brake. But the real stopping power will come from supersonic retropropulsion—basically, firing engines at the planet in the same way SpaceX lands its Falcon 9 rockets. Except this ship will be going many, many times faster than that, and the crew capsule is way heavier. Then again, Mars' gravity is about one-third that of Earth's, so maybe everything will be cool. Hell, I'm not a physicist, people. Welcome to your new home!

OK, cool. Why are you here again? Saving humanity. As Musk put it at the beginning of his speech: ""I really think there are two fundamental paths [for humans]: One path is we stay on Earth forever, and some eventual extinction event wipes us out.""

What!?

""I don’t have a doomsday prophesy.""

OK, whew.

""But history suggests some doomsday event will happen.""

Elon, that's by definition a doomsday prophesy!

""The alternative is, become a spacefaring and multi-planetary species.""

Mars, he points out, is one of the best bets for setting up humanity's Battlestar Galactica starter kit. It’s close by, it has lots of water (frozen beneath the surface). For farming, the atmosphere is has vital nutrients like carbon dioxide and nitrogen. And the gravity is just 37 percent that of Earth, which means you’d be able to lift friggin' anything and dunk like Michael in Space Jam. Plus, red never goes out of style.

And importantly, ITS is not a one-way system. Using methane fuel harvested from the Martian regolith, Musk says, the spaceship would be able to lift free from Mars' weak gravity and return to Earth. This part of the plan is crucial to cutting those interplanetary costs. If commercial aircraft weren’t reusable, a red eye might cost you half a million dollars or more. But just like reusable jetliner makes it possible for you to fly anywhere in the continental US for under a grand, Musk says his reusable system will make Mars cheaper than most mortgages.

Musk's ultimate vision is a Martian city of millions. This will take thousands of ships, tens of thousands of trips. And, in his estimation, about 40 to 100 years. But all that starts small. Despite a recent pre-launch explosion, Musk still hopes to send a Dragon 2 capsule to Mars in 2018—when Earth and Mars' orbits bring the planets closest to one another. Then again, and again, every 27 months, when Earth and Mars again perigee, SpaceX will transport two to three tons of equipment to the Martian surface.

Pardon the mixed metaphor, but this whole thing redefines the word moonshot. Musk has always stated that his goal for SpaceX is to get to Mars. All these ISS resupply contracts and communications satellite launches are just ways to build capital and develop technology on the way to that goal. In response to an audience member asking whether Musk wanted to go to space, the SpaceX CEO replied: ""I’ve gotta make sure if something goes wrong on the flight and I die, there’s a good succession plan and the mission of the company continues and doesn’t get taken over by investors who just want to maximize profit and not go to Mars. That’s my biggest fear."" Real talk.

But SpaceX doesn't have the money to do this on its own. As Elizabeth Lopatto from The Verge brilliantly pointed out this morning, the whole point of this today's speech is to pique the interest of other monied space fanatics. Musk is rich, and SpaceX is doing pretty good business sending satellites into orbit (notwithstanding the odd explosion now and then), but the company is nowhere near making the billions necessary to jumpstart its Mars ambitions.

How far to go? Well, SpaceX just did a successful test-fire of the Raptor engine, which has three times the propulsive power as the Merlins it uses on the Falcon 9. “I’m amazed it didn’t blow up on its first firing,” Musk says. The company's engineers have also made progress on the carbon fiber fuel tanks. As any distance bicyclist will tell you (ad naseum), carbon fiber has amazing strength to weight ratio (just don’t put it in a clamp!). But making a mold big enough, without cracks, and having it cure at the right temperature is an enormously difficult challenge. Musk says he hopes to have the first developmental spaceship ready to operate in about three years. If things go super well, the one could be ready to depart in about 10 years.

But he's hedgy: “I don’t want to say that’s when this will occur."" And success is not a foregone conclusion. “This is a huge amount of risk, will cost a lot, and there’s a good chance we won’t succeed,"" he says. “But we’re going to try and do our best.” So, feeling inspired?"

Hong + Elon Musk,"In perhaps the most eagerly anticipated aerospace announcement of the year, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has revealed his grand plan for establishing a human settlement on Mars.

In short, Musk thinks it’s possible to begin shuttling thousands of people between Earth and our smaller, redder neighbor sometime within the next decade or so. And not too long after that—perhaps 40 or a hundred years later, Mars could be home to a self-sustaining colony of a million people.

“This is not about everyone moving to Mars, this is about becoming multiplanetary,” he said on September 27 at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. “This is really about minimizing existential risk and having a tremendous sense of adventure.”

Musk’s timeline sounds ambitious, and that's something he readily acknowledges.

“I think the technical outline of the plan is about right. He also didn’t pretend that it was going to be easy and that they were going to do it in ten years,” says Bobby Braun, NASA’s former chief technologist who’s now at Georgia Tech University. “I mean, who’s to say what’s possible in a hundred years?”

And for those wondering whether we should go at all, the reason for Musk making Mars an imperative is simple.

“The future of humanity is fundamentally going to bifurcate along one of two directions: Either we’re going to become a multiplanet species and a spacefaring civilization, or we’re going be stuck on one planet until some eventual extinction event,” Musk told Ron Howard during an interview for National Geographic Channel’s MARS, a global event series that premieres worldwide on November 14.

“For me to be excited and inspired about the future, it’s got to be the first option. It’s got to be: We’re going to be a spacefaring civilization.”

Mars Fleet

Though he admitted his exact timeline is fuzzy, Musk thinks it’s possible humans could begin flying to Mars by the mid-2020s. And he thinks the plan for getting there will go something like this:

SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System Watch an animation of Elon Musk's vision for how to send humans to Mars.



It starts with a really big rocket, something at least 200 feet tall when fully assembled. In a simulation of what SpaceX calls its Interplanetary Transport System, a spacecraft loaded with astronauts will launch on top of a 39-foot-wide booster that produces a whopping 28 million pounds of thrust. Using 42 Raptor engines, the booster will accelerate the assemblage to 5,374 miles an hour.

Overall, the whole thing is 3.5 times more powerful than NASA’s Saturn V, the biggest rocket built to date, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon. Perhaps not coincidentally, the SpaceX rocket would launch from the same pad, 39A, at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The rocket would deliver the crew capsule to orbit around Earth, then the booster would steer itself toward a soft landing back at the launch pad, a feat that SpaceX rocket boosters have been doing for almost a year now. Next, the booster would pick up a fuel tanker and carry that into orbit, where it would fuel the spaceship for its journey to Mars.

Once en route, that spaceship would deploy solar panels to harvest energy from the sun and conserve valuable propellant for what promises to be an exciting landing on the Red Planet.

As Musk envisions it, fleets of these crew-carrying capsules will remain in Earth orbit until a favorable planetary alignment brings the two planets close together—something that happens every 26 months. “We’d ultimately have upward of a thousand or more spaceships waiting in orbit. And so the Mars colonial fleet would depart en masse,” Musk says.

The key to his plan is reusing the various spaceships as much as possible. “I just don’t think there’s any way to have a self-sustaining Mars base without reusability. I think this is really fundamental,” Musk says. “If wooden sailing ships in the old days were not reusable, I don’t think the United States would exist.”

Musk anticipates being able to use each rocket booster a thousand times, each tanker a hundred times, and each spaceship 12 times. At the beginning, he imagines that maybe a hundred humans would be hitching a ride on each ship, with that number gradually increasing to more than 200.

By his calculations, then, putting a million people on Mars could take anywhere from 40 to a hundred years after the first ship launches.

And, no, it would not necessarily be a one-way trip: “I think it’s very important to give people the option of returning,” Musk says.

Colonizing Mars

After landing a few cargo-carrying spacecraft without people on Mars, starting with the Red Dragon capsule in 2018, Musk says the human phase of colonization could begin.

For sure, landing a heavy craft on a planet with a thin atmosphere will be difficult. It was tough enough to gently lower NASA’s Curiosity rover to the surface, and at 2,000 pounds, that payload weighed just a fraction of Musk’s proposed vessels. For now, Musk plans to continue developing supersonic retrorockets that can gradually and gently lower a much heavier spacecraft to the Martian surface, using his reusable Falcon 9 boosters as a model.

And that’s not all these spacecraft will need: Hurtling through the Martian atmosphere at supersonic speeds will test even the most heat-tolerant materials on Earth, so it’s no small task to design a spacecraft that can withstand a heated entry and propulsive landing—and then be refueled and sent back to Earth so it can start over again.

The first journeys would primarily serve the purpose of delivering supplies and establishing a propellant depot on the Martian surface, a fuel reservoir that could be tapped into for return trips to Earth. After that depot is set up and cargo delivered to the surface, the fun can (sort of) begin. Early human settlers will need to be good at digging beneath the surface and dredging up buried ice, which will supply precious water and be used to make the cryo-methane propellant that will power the whole enterprise.

As such, the earliest interplanetary spaceships would probably stay on Mars, and they would be carrying mostly cargo, fuel, and a small crew: “builders and fixers” who are “the hearty explorer type,” Musk said to Howard. “Are you prepared to die? If that’s OK, then you’re a candidate for going.”

While there will undoubtedly be intense competition and lots of fanfare over the first few seats on a Mars-bound mission, Musk worries that too much emphasis will be placed on those early bootprints.

“In the sort of grander historical context, what really matters is being able to send a large number of people, like tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people, and ultimately millions of tons of cargo,” he says. “I actually care much more about that than, say, the first few trips.”

In short, his vision for establishing a settlement on Mars is more an endurance sport than a sprint.

Rocket Man

But Musk is used to that. In 2001, he founded SpaceX with one goal in mind: put humans on Mars. At the time, he recalls, he found himself thinking about why, after the successful Apollo missions to the moon, humans hadn’t visited Mars—or reached very far into space at all.

“It always seemed like we should have gone there by now, and we should have had a base on the moon, and we should have had space hotels and all these things,” he said to Howard. “I’d assumed that it was a lack of will … it was not a lack of will.”

Pull Quote I think what we want to avoid is a replay of Apollo. Elon Musk, SpaceX

Instead, resources devoted to space exploration were scarce, and government spaceflight programs couldn’t assume the kind of risk that a private endeavor could tolerate. With an accumulated fortune from his time at Paypal, Musk founded a company dedicated to building rockets and vastly improving the vehicles that form the foundation of an interplanetary journey.

Contracts with private clients and the U.S. government followed, and now SpaceX is working on a version of its Dragon capsule that can send humans to the International Space Station.

Over the years, the company has had many high-profile successes—including landing the first suborbital reusable rocket stages on land and at sea—and its share of failures, with rockets exploding on the launch pad or en route to orbit.

That’s no surprise for any big technology development. But putting humans on Mars is a completely different challenge from sending humans into orbit, or even to the moon, especially when the goal isn’t just a few casual trips.

“I think what we want to avoid is a replay of Apollo,” Musk says. “We don’t want to send a few people, a few missions to Mars and then never go there again. That that will not accomplish the multiplanetary goal.”

Funding Muskville

Musk’s ultimate vision of a second, self-sustaining habitat for humans in the solar system is grand and lofty, but by no means unique. What makes Musk’s plan stand out from centuries of science fiction is that he might actually be able to make it happen—if he can bring costs down to his ideal levels.

“Entrepreneurs are able to look at questions that we think about, but we’re not quite ready to go there yet, things like supersonic retrograde propulsion,” said NASA administrator Charlie Bolden during a panel at the IAC.

""I think we can quibble over the numbers and the dollars and the timeframes and all, but we shouldn’t lose the fact that this guy went out on the international stage today and just laid it all out on the line,"" Braun adds. ""I found it refreshing.""

But for Mars to be a viable destination, Musk says the cost of the trip needs to come down to about $200,000, or the average price of a house in the United States. Trouble is, that’s a significant decrease from current cost estimates.

Musk doesn’t anticipate being able to do all of this on his own and said to Howard that some sort of synergistic relationship between governments and private industry will be crucial.

“I think we want to try to get as much in the way of private resources dedicated to the cause, and then get as much as possible in the way of government resources, so that if one of those funding sources disappears, things continue.”

But combining different management styles, abilities to assume risk, sources of funding, and working with old institutional road maps will be a challenge, to say the least.

How might that all work? “With difficulty,” says space policy expert John Logsdon, professor emeritus at The George Washington University. “It will involve breaking things.”

For instance, reaching Mars in the 2020s will require a bit of a kick in the pants for SpaceX on the technology front. The massive rocket featured in the simulation is much more powerful than anything in the company’s current arsenal. The first iteration of that futuristic rocket, a gargantuan stepping stone known as the Falcon Heavy, has already been delayed for years.

These types of delays are one of the reasons why space policy experts are skeptical about the timing of Musk’s plan, which he acknowledges is murky at best.

“Based on past performance, I don’t know how you could say, well, yeah he’s missed all these other deadlines, but this time he’s gonna do it,” Logsdon says. “So I think the reasonable posture is that I’ll believe it when he does it.”

If humans do manage to touch down on Mars, Musk thinks the momentum from such an achievement will propel additional developments, just as early explorers searching for glory, gold, and spices drove improvements in ship technology and global industry.

Ultimately, Musk believes this kind of endeavor will bring Mars out of the realm of science fiction and transform it from a world fraught with difficulty and danger to one that humans might actually enjoy living on—including Musk."

SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk on Tuesday laid out his plans for colonizing Mars and then sending humans out among the stars. But buried in his announcement were a host of fascinatingly specific details stripped straight from sci-fi novels.

Here’s a roundup of what caught our attention:

Warm Mars up

He casually mentioned TRANSFORMING AN ENTIRE PLANET. We’re not just talking about a little “HAB,” like the one from The Martian movie and book. No, he’s talking about transporting a million people to the Red Planet. All those people would need places to live and work, and as part of that process, Musk suggested we could make oceans and an atmosphere if we could just “warm Mars up.”

Warming the entire planet would cause its ice to melt, releasing water vapor and helping create more of an atmosphere. Temperatures from Mars today range from 70 degrees in the day near the equator to -100 degrees at night. It gets significantly colder than that at the poles. And to protect humans from the radiation, the new Martians would simply build their own magnetic field, which would block charged particles like our Earth atmosphere.

We're going multiplanetary

Musk pointed out that most species on Earth end up dead. If we don’t want to go the way of the dinosaurs and dodos, we need to spread ourselves among the stars, he said. The title of his presentation was officially “Making humans a multiplanetary species.” Said Musk: “Eventually history suggests there will be some extinction event.” Well that’s a cheerful thought.

Slush methane powered

The spaceship that would take those humans to Mars, along with virtually everything they’d need to survive? It would be powered by methane slush, which could be manufactured on Earth and on Mars. Slushy methane would be easier to deal with than kerosene or other fuels that normally power rockets, and SpaceX has already built a massive carbon fiber tank to test out the technology needed to hold in the fuel. The price would be around $200,000 for a person and their belongings, he suggested. Without a lower cost, you’d have to be a billionaire with a space obsession in order to get yourself to the Red Planet…oh right. That’s actually exactly what he’s talking about.

Bonus fact: the first ship would be called ""Heart of Gold,"" which is the name of the spaceship from the famous novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

""Obviously it's going to be a challenge to fund this whole endeavor,"" Elon Musk says of Mars colonization plan. Yeah, you could say that. — Nathan Bomey (@NathanBomey) September 27, 2016

Enjoy a 30 day trip

Getting yourself to Mars could take just 30 days, once the system is optimized for frequent use. Musk said it’s possible today to get anywhere on Earth in 24 hours, and he envisions a spacecraft in which people will play 0-g games, watch movies and attend lectures as they whip through space at around 62,000 mph. We’re guessing he doesn’t fly commercial much, though. We’ve seen how people behave when they’re stuck on a plane for just a couple of hours. Toenail clippers? Loud talkers? Yeah, 30 days with those people?

You can come home, but may not make it

If you wanted to come home, that would be an option, even if you never used it. Because the spaceships will be resusable, they’ll effectively be on a constant loop between Earth and Mars, Musk said: Return flights would likely be free, he said with a laugh. The risk of death would be high, too, and kids probably would be barred.

He also said he wouldn't take the first flight because he wants to see his kids grow up, and also worries that if he dies, someone would screw up his SpaceX plans. (As a reminder, today we have a method of transportation that kills about 30,000 people every year, so maybe let’s weigh the odds. And yes, that IS also why Musk's Tesla is developing self-driving cars.)

Bonus: Mars pizza

Need we say more? Ok, for context, he repeatedly mentioned how moving people to Mars would require everything from steel foundries to pizza restaurants. After all there’s no lumber, running water or vegetation on which to forage. We’d have to start nearly from scratch.

If we're gonna have a sustainable pizza place on Mars, we're gonna need cows to make the milk to make the cheese. Space cows. — Jeremy Grosser (@JeremyGrosser) September 27, 2016

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who laid out his Mars plans today at a press conference, hopes to eventually make the cost of taking a trip to Mars equal that of the average US home, at around $200,000 per ticket. Still, there's a long road ahead to funding the complex architecture of a stable Earth-Mars transportation system.

To cement his commitment to the project, Musk says the only reason he's personally accumulating wealth — through his various ventures in renewable energy, electric cars, and space transport, is to help make this radical idea a reality. ""As we show that this is possible, that this dream is real, I think the support will snowball over time,"" Musk said onstage today at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico.

Not Elon Musk, though. And it has paid off handsomely. In the last nine days, the iconic entrepreneur has gotten almost $5 billion richer, according to Bloomberg data.

Musk is currently worth $21.3 billion, putting him in the 37th spot on Bloomberg's ranking of the wealthiest people in the world.

The surge in Musk's wealth is twofold.

On July 27, his aerospace company, SpaceX, closed a $350 million equity funding round, pushing the value of the company to $21.2 billion, according to financial data analytics company CB Insights.

In 2015, SpaceX was worth only $12 billion. The jump in valuation added $4 billion to Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg.

Tesla's stock price also surged 7 percent on Thursday, after the company announced its quarterly results — this despite some investors' concerns about Tesla's ability to deliver on its Model 3 production promise.

The increase in share price added $800 million to Musk's fortune, according to Bloomberg.

Though making nearly $5 billion in just over a week is the sort of financial success that most only dream about, being CEO of multiple high-performing companies has its downside, according to Musk.

He opened up about it on Sunday, tweeting, ""The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress.""

But that, he says, is part of what it means to be a multi-billionaire entrepreneur trying to change the world.

""If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell,"" he says."
http://fortune.com/2017/08/03/elon-musks-tweets-about-mental-health-are-a-reminder-that-great-highs-often-come-with-invisible-terrible-lows/,pos,1.0,8.633130582131212e-23,Elon Musk Opens Up About Unrelenting Stress,2017-08-03 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:47:55.279282,Ellen Mcgirt,"In a series of tweets earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke candidly about stress and his mental health.

When asked about his picture perfect online life, the CEO responded, “The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don’t think people want to hear about the last two.”

The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2017

When asked if he were bipolar, Musk tweeted, “yeah.” Then added, “Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for.”

Then finally this: “If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn’t fair to blame hell …”

A lot of people felt that last one.

It’s important to point out that a bipolar disorder diagnosis can only be confirmed by a physician. The condition, which requires medical management and support, is nothing to be ashamed of. But Musk’s tweets were an important window into the life of someone who more than occasionally suffers under the weight of the ambitions he once readily signed up for.

“Anyone with many responsibilities – especially those that impact other people – are certainly at risk for high amounts of stress,” explains Dr. Richard Yep, the CEO and executive vice president of the American Counseling Association in Alexandria, Va. It’s a short trip to burn out, anxiety, anger, and depression, he says. “The feeling of ‘never being able to please everyone’ can lead to a feeling of isolationism,” he says. “It would not be surprising to see that those entering the executive ranks – or those who have been ‘the boss’ for many years – will begin to feel stress and anxiety that then could lead to various mental health challenges,” he says.

The stigma of admitting to the effects of stress or a diagnosed condition is profound. “Senior executives managing their disorders are dealing with their issues, and at the same time, they are putting up their guard,” says Wendy Murphy, head of the Human Resources Practice at RSR Partners, an executive search and leadership consulting firm. Organizations that want to better help high potential executives cope with mental illness need to have policies in place that are directed by a trusted chief people officer (or his or her equivalent), who has the ear of senior management. Those policies need to feed the human part of leadership – such as the candid conversations that let people set boundaries, ask for support, and take time-outs to care for themselves. “If those partnerships don’t exist, or if the executive is surrounded by the wrong people, the situation can bleed into risk.”

Younger rank-and-filers who are living with some sort of mental or physical limitation have found an unexpected ally in novelist and essayist Esmé Weijun Wang.

Wang, who lives with late-stage Lyme disease and schizoaffective disorder, has been dealing with various illnesses since she was a pre-teen. Her essay on her thoughts on diagnosis is a must-read. Here’s a snapshot of her 2013: “I spent most of that year spinning in and out of different harrowing beliefs: there were spiders in my brain, my husband had poisoned my tea, there were cameras spying on me in every corner of the flat, and so on. 2013 was also the year that I surrendered my last benchmark of sanity, otherwise known as my full-time job at a fast-paced startup company.”

And yet, in spite of everything, she persisted. She’s moved on from her work in health care, to produce an extraordinary amount of writing, winning awards both for her novel, The Border of Paradise, and her forthcoming essay collection, The Collected Schizophrenias. Her message? If she can succeed, so can you.

She is the founder of The Unexpected Shape, an online resource for “ambitious people living with limitations.” We all have them. “It’s the shape that our lives take when we realize the boundaries that exist around it,” she says. “Our lives can look beautiful within that shape.”

It is a true trove of candid advice – she offers an e-mail course called A**-Kicking With Limitations – but where she really excels is in erasing the intersection between illness and achievement. “The key thing to remember is that you are still you and even if it feels like your illness or your mental health condition is really taking over your life there are still aspects of you that have nothing to do with that,” she said in an interview with Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls. The contributions we make through our work are a vital part of who we are.

Of course, we need C-Suites to be committed to designing systems that support people with invisible limitations, particularly those who don’t have the embedded privileges of someone like Elon Musk.

But back to Musk for a moment. To answer his assertion, yes, people do want to hear about the lows and unrelenting stress. By publicly grappling with the unexpected shape of his own life, even briefly, Musk added an admirable element to an important conversation.

Technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has been digging deep into the future of travel — and he thinks some marvels will arrive sooner than many would expect.

Motoring from Los Angeles to New York City in a fully autonomous car?

By the end of 2017, he predicted during an interview in Vancouver on Friday as part of a conference sponsored byTED, the non-profit that provides a forum for a wide range of ideas by leading thinkers.

“November or December of this year, we should be able to go from a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point during the entire journey,” said Musk, who is CEO of Tesla, the luxury electric-car maker which is trying to stay at the cutting edge of self-driving technology, according to a remarks provided by TED.

Underground car travel via a network of new tunnels excavated by a Musk startup dubs The Boring Company?

Cars carrying passengers at 124 miles per hour atop skate-like platforms will whisk through the tubes, as seen in a video that accompanied Musk's appearance Friday. He wasn't as specific about a time frame on that one. The cars slide onto the platforms at street level, descend down an elevator and then they automatically go flying through the tunnels. Speaking of tunnels, Musk has also supported the idea of a hyperloop, which are tubes that he envisions connecting cities where people could fly along in comfort at jetliner-like speeds.

And how about the Tesla semi-truck?

Coming in the fall. A teaser image released Friday showed a shadowy big rig with headlights like those on Tesla's Model X and Model S autos and a continuous design across the truck's front cabin, TechCrunch reported.

“With the Tesla Semi, we want to show that an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi,"" Musk said Friday. ""If you had a tug of war competition, the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.”

It's not the first time that Musk has made big predictions at TED. During a 2013 appearance, Musk, who is also CEO of rocket maker Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, talked extensively about manned missions to Mars. In that forecast, he was looking much farther into the future.

""I really think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets ... compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event,"" he said.

The South Africa-born businessman said during his that appearance that he started thinking about travel breakthroughs while studying at Queen's University in Canada and then the University of Pennsylvania.

""I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?"" said Musk. ""I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production. That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century, independent of environmental concerns.""

Not that it will be easy. In developing his space launch business, Musk and his company have seen more than their setbacks, which usually come in the form of spectacular explosions.

For instance, there was the September 2016 explosion of a SpaceX Falcon rocket while it was being tested at Florida's Cape Canaveral.

Nonetheless, Musk's company learned from the setback.

In March, SpaceX successfully relaunched a used Falcon 9 rocket, successfully demonstrating the reliability of new technology that Musk said would lower the cost of space exploration and travel. The relaunch was made possible by the company's ability to let rockets land back on pads after they take off, an innovation that only came about after several fiery failures.

Other breakthroughs could be on the way. Musk was talking about solar power before solar provider SolarCity became part of Tesla.

Asked if he could picture a future in which Americans get most of their power from solar sources, Musk offered an optimistic answer.

""I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power, and most likely a majority, and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years,"" said Musk, who defined plurality as ""more from solar than any other source.""

Musk's The Boring Company released a map this week, sketching out a potential new tunnel system for Los Angeles that would transport cars and mass transit.

The underground transportation system, which the Boring Company is calling Loop, would ferry autonomous electric skates around tunnels at 125 mph to 150 mph. Transportation would be point-to-point, rather than regularly stopping at multiple stations like a subway train.

His company, which is less than a year old, envisions fixing congestion in cities -- a near universal problem. Commutes could be quicker and more pleasant.

If completed, the roughly 60-mile system would position Los Angeles as the home of one of the nation's largest underground transportation systems. The city has long lagged behind the rest of the country in terms of public transportation.

The golden age of subway construction passed decades ago. Tunnels cost billions of dollars to build, and most cities struggle to maintain existing systems. Yet Musk -- motivated by a hatred of L.A. traffic -- is modifying tunnel equipment to build a network of low-cost tunnels to try and solve congestion.

Musk's tunnel ambitions aren't limited to Los Angeles. The Boring Company has government permission for a 10.1-mile stretch in Maryland, and is bidding to build a high-speed subway from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport.

But can Musk pull it off?

Transportation experts warn that Musk has taken on a Herculean task.

""The viability of the business model is a significant hurdle probably only eclipsed by the complexity of the environmental review and the possibility of legal challenges,"" cautioned Juan Matute, associate director of UCLA Lewis Center and the Institute of Transportation Studies.

But Musk has a track record of accomplishing some feats. His auto company, Tesla, has made electric cars desirable, despite its issues keeping up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, SpaceX -- where Musk is also the CEO -- has created low-cost, reusable rockets.

According to a Boring Company spokesperson, the Los Angeles project will require no public funding. It is counting on decreased tunneling costs to fundamentally upend the economics of building and operating a transit system.

""It's refreshing that somebody has this idea,"" Clifton Hood, the author of 722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York, told CNN Tech. ""It's been about 100 years since anyone thought about doing this. But it sounds like a fantasy.""

UCLA's Matute said Hong Kong is the world's only transit system that doesn't require public subsidies to break even. It has the advantage of profits coming not from transportation, but from real estate development.

By not seeking public funding, The Boring Company is returning to the early days of subway systems. They were privately operated and built in new residential and commercial developments. This effort increased the value of developments, which made money for the businesspeople who owned the land and subways. When the Great Depression hit, governments stepped in and public funding became the norm.

So far, The Boring Company has completed a short tunnel segment by SpaceX's Los Angeles headquarters. It has applied for an excavation permit for a 6.5-mile route in Los Angeles, shown in red on the map below.

A spokeswoman with the city's Bureau of Engineering said it will review the application in the coming weeks and meet with the Boring Company to determine next steps.

""L.A. has always been a place where innovators come to build new ideas that can change our lives. Looking forward to exploring how Elon Musk's Boring Company could help us build a better future for our city,"" Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted recently.

Spokesmen for the mayor and the Boring Company stressed that there would be a robust public discussion before moving forward. The Phase 2, roughly 60-mile tunnel network is a concept, not a finalized plan.

However, Matute cautions that the tunnels could become congested. Loop will use a lift to deliver vehicles from the tunnels to surface-level streets.

But if these streets are ever congested, there may be no space to place vehicles, triggering a line in the tunnel.

Traditional subway systems don't face this problem, as dedicated underground stations provide a place for people to board and exit trains.

Yonah Freemark -- the founder of The Transport Politic, a website tracking public transportation -- warned that the impact of Musk's Loop on existing transportation systems needs to be understood. Tunnels might make vehicle transportation more appealing, causing increased traffic on roads and near stations.

It's also unclear if Loop will connect with Los Angeles's existing mass transit systems.

""We're all in a bit of darkness about what's going on,"" Freemark said. ""Putting some lines on a map is not being open about your plans."""

The company, dedicated to building an underground transit network, has yet to build a working subterranean system. However, it has been piling up permits (paywall) and endorsements from government agencies, and dug a test tunnel in the parking lot of SpaceX in Hawthorne, California (Musk is founder of both companies).

The Boring Company published the map on its website on Dec. 5. It shows a 6.5-mile proof-of-concept tunnel through Los Angeles (for which it claimed to have filed permits) and a Phase 2 expansion (blue on the map) that would stretch for more than 50 miles through major arteries of the city. The Boring Company warned the map is intended as “a concept, not as a finalized alignment” and it wanted to cooperate with county and city governments, as well as the general public.

Musk, who is CEO of the Boring Company as well as Tesla and SpaceX, has done something similar before with great fanfare, and even less approval. In July, Musk caused a stir by announcing a 500-mile underground transit link between major US cities on the east coast.

He later tweeted that the Los Angeles route could be built in parallel with a New York-Washington DC track, followed by connections to San Francisco and a Texas loop (Hyperloop recently held a route competition to pick the most feasible ones). The only problem? None of the cities had publicly confirmed any of Musk’s plans at the time, and all denied any talks had even begun.

A White House spokesman later said the Trump administration had “promising conversations” with Musk, apparently the source of Musk’s verbal approval. In October, Maryland governor Larry Hogan tweeted (paywall) his administration was proud “to support The Boring Company to bring rapid electric transportation to MD — connecting Baltimore City to D.C.” The state issued the Boring Company a utility permit to dig 10 miles of tunnel below state-owned portions of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Musk has been teasing the arrival of the tunnels for months. In October, Musk wrote on Twitter that his company had bored 500 feet of the 2 miles (10,560 feet) that it plans to complete over the next four months. It received approval to build a two-mile test tunnel in August from Hawthorne’s city council."

Universal basic income is a system in which all citizens receive a standard amount of money each month to cover basic expenses like food, rent, and clothes.

On Monday, Musk doubled down on his initial support for the concept.

""I think we'll end up doing universal basic income,"" Musk told the crowd at the World Government Summit in Dubai, according to Fast Company. ""It's going to be necessary.""

The economic forecasts for the next several decades don't bode well for the American worker. In March, President Barack Obama warned Congress about the looming threat of job loss, based on several reports that found that as much as 50% of jobs could be replaced by robots by 2030.

The downside of that projection is that millions of people would wind up out of a job — a possibility Musk discussed at the summit.

""There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better,"" he said. ""I want to be clear. These are not things I wish will happen; these are things I think probably will happen.""

Executives who have endorsed UBI — a group that includes Y Combinator President Sam Altman and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes — also say automation would dramatically increase a society's wealth.

""With automation, there will come abundance,"" Musk said. ""Almost everything will get very cheap.""

That money theoretically could be redistributed to give people financial security even if they didn't work. UBI advocates often point to reduced costs as a reason the system could be cheaper to implement than most might assume.

""Because a very small amount of people have an almost unimaginable amount of money at the very top, a basic income could actually decrease almost everyone else's income tax burdens except for theirs,"" Scott Santens, a UBI advocate, wrote for The Huffington Post.

Musk retains some skepticism about the effects of UBI. He has voiced concerns about what would happen to people's sense of purpose if they had less of a need — or no need — to work.

""If there's no need for your labor, what's your meaning?"" Musk said. ""Do you feel useless? That's a much harder problem to deal with."""

https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/6/14520608/elon-musk-trump-tesla-business-deal-economic-advisory-team,pos,1.0,4.54660164728276e-35,Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist,2017-02-06 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:48:03.010466,Feb,"Alongside “alternative facts” and “night Twitter,” “crony capitalism” has become a key phrase for the Trump era. The term describes a market where success is determined by political favor rather than consumer choice. Modern Russia is a classic example: if you want to succeed in the Russian oil business, you’re better off making friends with Putin than studying up on drill mechanics. The US isn’t quite there yet, but when Trump starts badgering companies to keep factories in the US — while refusing to divest from his own globe-spanning real estate business — many see a new era of US crony capitalism in the making.

Picking winners and losers is a troubling government practice for lots of reasons, but it’s particularly embarrassing for the businesses playing the game. If a company spends enough energy currying favor with the government, it starts to look like it’s doing so at the expense of its own product. What’s the point of building Google when the government can force everyone to use Alta Vista?

Musk is working hard to make friends with Donald Trump

It’s surprising, then, to see Elon Musk working so hard to make friends with Donald Trump. Musk is usually held up as a model entrepreneur — someone using bold ideas and compelling products to tackle some of the world’s most urgent problems. But since Trump was elected, he’s been behaving an awful lot like a crony capitalist. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO joined the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum in December, and raised eyebrows among climate hawks by defending Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson’s bid for secretary of state the following month.

More recently, Musk joined CEOs from across the industry in condemning Trump’s haphazard immigration restrictions, but it came just as Musk was joining up to Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Thus far, he’s shown no sign of withdrawing from the initiative, or the larger advisory forum. Even Travis Kalanick, usually cast as the Lex Luthor of the tech world, bowed out of the president’s advisory group after facing boycotts from riders and drivers alike.

Musk has also bowed out of some of the new administration’s biggest legal fights. On Saturday, 97 tech companies filed a joint amicus brief against Trump’s immigration ban, a tangible show of legal resistance against the controversial order. Signers included Apple, Google, Microsoft, Uber, and even Musk’s old home PayPal. Tesla and SpaceX were notably absent from the list. Suddenly, Musk is the only tech CEO working to stay on the new president’s good side. (Update: Tesla and SpaceX joined the lawsuit on the afternoon of February 6th, after this piece was published.)

Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2017

Musk has defended his advisory role as a way to influence Trump for the better, particularly on issues of climate and space travel. Over the weekend, he touted two small successes, adding the travel bans to the agenda at a White House meeting and raising the issue of climate change to the same group. In each case, it’s hard to say how effective he was at influencing policy. Given the largely ceremonial role of both groups, there’s plenty of reason to be skeptical.

There’s also a more cynical explanation. Musk’s businesses have long benefited from government support, and given Trump’s eagerness to throw elbows, there’s reason to think that support might melt away if the president felt slighted. That’s not normally how we think of Musk, who’s more associated with startup self-reliance than government largesse — but the dynamic was in place long before Trump arrived on the scene. Musk always had the soft power of government on his side, and it’s been an important force in making his ambitious bets pay off. The political winds may have shifted, but Musk can’t. This is the logic of crony capitalism: if you want to survive, you have to stay on the ruler’s good side.

For Tesla, government support is often quite direct. Right now, every Tesla buyer in the US walks off the lot with a $7,500 federal tax credit, with additional credits ranging up to $25,000 depending on the state and model. A similar credit lets you deduct up to 30 percent of the cost of home solar panels, a tax break that has fueled the growth of Musk’s SolarCity business, which recently merged with Tesla.

If Trump ever turned on Musk, the damage to his companies would be immediate and disastrous

There are good policy arguments for each credit — particularly the solar installations, which can play a crucial role in the larger power grid. But those federal tax breaks have been central factors in Tesla and SolarCity’s success, and both businesses will be badly damaged if the measures are revoked. With Trump and congressional Republicans eager to roll back environmental measures, it’s not hard to imagine those tax breaks coming under fire in the next budget.

Beyond the federal subsidies, Musk’s businesses have benefited from a number of local tax breaks and one-off grants, with some estimates putting the total amount of government subsidy as high as $4.5 billion. There’s also SpaceX, which relies heavily on federal contracts as well as the broader push toward privatized space flight.

Those aren’t necessarily bad deals for the government, and I don’t bring them up to cast Musk as a freeloader. Tesla and SpaceX really do create jobs and solve problems that governments otherwise couldn’t. But the sheer scale of the subsidies shows how much Musk would have to lose in a protracted feud with the president, and how vulnerable he is to the logic of crony capitalism. If Trump ever turned on Musk, the damage to his companies would be immediate and disastrous. Like a Russian oligarch, his success depends on staying in the government’s good favor.

It’s hard to say how this bargain ends

Musk is not alone in this. Nearly all of the businesses he’s disrupting are more reliant on government support — most notably the Detroit automakers, the United Launch Alliance, and the oil industry in general. Most major corporations benefit from government policy in some way, if only through trade and tax deals. We’ve seen CEOs from Ford, AT&T, and Boeing all playing nice with Trump for similar reasons.

But while it’s common in the business world at large, that dynamic is still rare among recently founded tech companies, which often take a more adversarial stance toward the public sector. The comparison to Uber is instructive: having spent years waging total war against municipal governments, Kalanick and his company now have more to fear from drivers and customers than the president.

It’s hard to say how this bargain ends. Trump’s executive order on immigration was his administration’s first major flash point, but less than a month into his first term, it won’t be the last. The threat to Tesla and SpaceX will remain constant, while the cost of aligning with Trump will only grow. Musk’s bet may still pay off like he wants, with greater influence and better policy, but it seems less likely by the day. Instead, he may join Chris Christie and Ted Cruz as would-be advisors who lost their dignity trying to stay in Trump’s good graces. For a business hero like Musk, that would be a long way to fall.

""I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting,"" he said. ""But I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.""

He’s had a 5,000-figure jump in cap sales in just the past two days. At $20 per cap, that means Musk has raised $700,000 to date.

The Boring Company, first drummed up by Musk last December after a particularly soul-crushing bout with L.A. traffic, was founded to find a quick and cost-effective way to dig networks of tunnels for vehicles and high-speed trains. By February, a giant hole meant to be a demonstration project appeared on the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne, Calif., the details of which were reported by Bloomberg.

Musk, who founded and now runs SpaceX and Tesla, introduced the branded baseball hat in March. Since then, Musk has provided periodic updates on hat sales via Twitter. The progress reports have ramped up in recent months as Musk decided to “cap” sales at 50,000 caps.

Elon Musk turned his attention earlier this year to a more earthly pursuit: digging tunnels. “Traffic is driving me nuts,” he wrote last December, apparently while stuck in gridlock on a Los Angeles freeway. “Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging . . .” Thus, The Boring Company was born. Its first mission: connect the subterranean parts of Los Angeles via tunnel system. Its second: sell a bunch of hats. And while the first goal has yet to coalesce, Musk’s wild success with the second has seemingly surpassed even his own expectations.

Musk introduced the branded baseball cap back in March, and it’s become something of a recurring in-joke on his Twitter account. “Almost 4,000 hats sold so far,” he tweeted on October 18. “Whoever buys the 5,000th gets a free hat with their hat!” The next day, another update: “Now at 6,400 hats . . .”

When Musk announced earlier this month that he would cap (sorry) sales of the $20 hats at 50,000 units, sales of the limited-edition headgear boomed. The next update came days later, on December 10. “Over 30,000 hats sold!” Musk said. A few minutes later he added: “After 50k hats, we will start selling The Boring Company flamethrower.” On Tuesday, he gave a numerical update: “35,000,” he tweeted. In other words, at $20 a pop, Musk has sold $700,000 worth of baseball caps.

As for the tunnel, Musk claimed via tweet this summer that the first and arguably most actionable part of the digging process, which took place in the SpaceX parking lot, was complete. “No longer waiting for Godot,” he tweeted in June, referring to the name of his company’s tunnel-digging machine, which Musk says is more powerful than other equivalent technology on the market. “It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in L.A.” To dig any further into the city of Los Angeles, Musk will need to obtain permits from the city. Whether he will actually see his tunnel project to completion is anyone’s guess, but he may, at the very least, be able to make $1 million off merchandise sales, assuming the next 15,000 hats move just as quickly."

I don't think there are two brains more un-alike that Musk's and Trump's on planet Earth. Adding to all this is Musk's endorsement of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State — a stunning development given Musk's ardent belief that global warming is an existential threat and that humanity needs to exit the fossil-fuel era as quickly as possible.

It's important to remember that Musk runs two companies (and really three, given Tesla's 2016 acquisition of struggling SolarCity) that have been highly dependent on the US government for everything from Department of Energy loan guarantees back when Tesla was facing extinction in 2008-09 to SpaceX's billion-dollar-plus launch contracts with NASA.

Musk has often been dinged for this — often by right-leaning GOP and probably Trump supporters who thinks Musk lives off government handouts — but Musk hasn't sought to diminish the debt his companies owe to the American people. You could argue that he's now going about paying it back, in a Trump-friendly manner, by increasing his US-based manufacturing operations at Tesla and SpaceX, including the construction of a massive battery factory in Nevada.

Musk could be hiring tens of thousands of American workers over the next decade. He could build numerous factories. He could colonize Mars and create vast new opportunities to construct Red Planet casinos, golf courses, and gilded human habitats for the Trump Organization.

Seriously, Musk is by nature a visionary who also has to function as a businessman, which I quite honestly think isn't second-nature to him. Instead, he operates opportunistically, and in Trump and possibly even more so Tillerson he sees a very big opportunity, once that he's already enhanced by gaining White House access.

'The unpriced externality'

With Tillerson, Musk has clearly found a person who can pressure Trump on a carbon tax, something that Musk called for in late 2015, during a speech at the Sorbonne in Paris.

""We have to fix the unpriced externality,"" he said, pointing out that pollution is classic negative externality in economic terms that causes harm to all, but cost to none. He called it a ""hidden carbon subsidy of $5.3 trillion per year.""

Tillerson supported a revenue-neutral carbon tax when he was at ExxonMobil as the best way to de-incentivize carbon generation. Economist and policymakers often agree, but some also think a carbon market would be a more effective means to halting global warming.

So with Musk, in the first order, we have a connect-the-dots between his reversal of sorts on Trump and his enthusiasm for Tillerson.

Secondarily, Musk knows that Tesla — and to a lesser degree SpaceX — can give Trump winning headlines about jobs, although detrimentally for Trump they would be jobs in California and Nevada rather than in Ohio or Pennsylvania (SolarCity operations are another story, as the company is now doing business in Buffalo, NY). For Trump, that's a priceless externality and his administration may be willing to reward Musk copiously, with everything from tax breaks to environmental regulations.

Finally, as many have pointed out, if Trump wants to give a speech about going to Mars and become a terra-cotta-tinged JFK, Musk will be more than happy to see his and SpaceX's stock rise with NASA, where although SpaceX is a customer, it's now confined to low-Earth orbits, leaving the deep-space fun to the guys who went to the Moon.

Outdealing the deal king

Musk has now joined the auto industry in quickly figuring out that Trump cares more about his brand than he does about the specifics of any deal — regardless of his fading reputation as the greatest dealmaker of all time.

Car companies are thrilled about Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes and roll back fuel-economy regulations, and their excitement has been dampened by the threat of a border tax on imported cars and parts (they'll just haggle over the specifics while they swell their balance sheets and continue building highly profitable pickups and SUVs).

To appease Trump, they'll invest some millions and hire at the margins in the US, while hedging against an inevitable sales downturn. The President gets the headlines, and they the get the sweet deal.

Likewise, Musk sees the best chance he's ever likely to have to get his carbon tax. And he knows that he was going to hire potentially tens of thousands of workers anyway, given that he has to fulfill almost 400,000 advance orders for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market vehicle and increase Tesla deliveries to 500,000 annually in less than two years. He already had the job-creating headlines, ready to go.

Give the CEOs what they want

I know this is going to sound cynical, but although Trump ran on being a business guy who would show the Washington political elites how it was done, he really hasn't been much of business force for a long time. And he's certainly no match for contemporary CEOs, especially the technologically sophisticated ones from Silicon Valley and the Big Kahunas from the multinational sphere, the crowd that Tillerson has run with.

Musk has always been a bit outside this framework because he truly is in it for the species — his companies are just a means to an end: saving the planet. But he knows how to grab his piece of the pie. He didn't secure NASA launch contracts and turn Tesla into a $40-billion-market-cap company because he's an amateur.

While he was doing that, Trump was hosting TV shows, peddling his brand around the globe, and exploiting the political prospects of conspiracy theories. Everything the new President did was spectacularly visible, of course, and that enabled him to undertake a hostile takeover of the US electorate, fueled by rage, mendacity, and heightened economic inequality, post-financial crisis, in the US.

So we're seeing what look like win-wins for Trump and the business world. In truth, they're ephemeral victories for the President and outright conquests for industries who priorities can rapidly dovetail with Trump's needs.

And for Musk, the possibilities are boundless. I'm not kidding: Mars is a two-year spaceflight away, on a SpaceX rocket. Tesla is already worth almost as much on paper as Ford, and Tesla only sold about 80,000 vehicles last year. Of course he's changed his tune on Trump. He can't lose."

The Verge co-founder Josh Topolsky got half-way through asking Musk if he thought our existence was simulated before the Tesla CEO jumped in to finish his question for him. ""I've had so many simulation discussions it's crazy,"" Musk explained. ""You've thought about this?"" Topolsky asked. ""A lot,"" Musk replied. ""It got to the point where every conversation was the AI / simulation conversation, and my brother and I agreed that we would ban such conversations if we were ever in a hot tub.""

""We've banned this conversation from hot tubs""

His argument — one presumably honed in the soothing waters of many a jaccuzi — goes that the incredibly fast advancement of video game technology indicates we'll be capable of creating a fully lifelike simulation of existence in a short span of time. In 40 years, Musk explained, we've gone from Pong to massively multiplayer online games with millions of simultaneous players, games with photorealistic graphics, and stand now on the cusp of a new wave of virtual and augmented reality experiences.

""If you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will become indistinguishable from reality,"" Musk said. ""Even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is now, let's just imagine it's 10,000 years in the future, which is nothing on the evolutionary scale."" Given that we're on that trajectory and that these games are increasingly playable on any device, Musk said, the odds that we are living our lives in base reality — that is, ""real"" reality — is one in billions.

It's not necessarily a bad thing

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. ""If a civilization stops advancing then that may be due to some calamitous event that erases civilization,"" Musk said, presenting two options. ""Either we're going to create simulations that are indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will cease to exist.""

Does it mean that the man famously worried about the dangers of artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence himself? Or are we avatars being guided by creatures in another reality? Perhaps those figures are themselves being controlled by a third existence? Maybe it's simulations all the way up, and we're just the game inside the game, like the versions of Minecraft built inside Minecraft?

There are billions of possibilities here, but one thing's for sure — you can see why Musk banned this topic of conversation in his hot tubs."
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/elon-musk-tesla-space-x-paypal-hyperloop-simulation,pos,1.0,2.9939077243656298e-15,Elon Musk: 'Chances are we're all living in a simulation',2016-06-02 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:48:12.279530,Alex Hern,"Elon Musk wears many hats. He’s the co-founder of online payments behemoth PayPal, the founder of private space flight pioneers SpaceX, the chief executive of electronic car manufacturers Tesla, and the original doodler of utopian transport concept Hyperloop. He’s also outspoken about the dangers of AI research, the need for blue-sky thinking in technology, and his desire to colonise another planet.

So it’s no surprise that over the course of an interview at California’s Code conference, Musk revealed a number of things we didn’t know before. Here’s some of them.

He’s afraid we’re all in a simulation

Musk is no stranger to the work of philosopher Nick Bostrom, who has warned before that superintelligent AI might wipe out humanity. Musk cited that fear as a reason for investing in AI company DeepMind, before it was bought by Google. But now he’s introduced the world to another concept popularised by Bostrum: the simulation problem.

The problem is that if realistic simulations of the universe are possible, then there would very quickly be far more simulations of reality than actual reality. Without any reason to assume we’re in reality rather than a simulation, the chances of us randomly happening to be in the one option among billions that isn’t fake is billions to one.

“Forty years ago we had Pong – two rectangles and a dot. That’s where we were,” Musk explained. “Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year. And soon we’ll have virtual reality, we’ll have augmented reality.

“If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality.”

And, Musk pointed out, if we aren’t in a simulation, the most likely reason for that isn’t that we are the first civilisation ever; instead, it’s that no civilisation has ever advanced far enough to simulate reality.

When Bostrum described the argument in 2003, he presented it as an unappealing trilemma: basically no civilisations last long enough to develop simulations, the civilisations that do develop simulations are so different from our own that they wouldn’t simulate us, or we are almost certainly in a simulation already.

Musk says he has had “so many simulation discussions it’s crazy”. Less philosophically minded people might wonder if it’s just the number of discussions that’s the crazy thing.

He wants to be King of Mars

SpaceX is on track to launch people to the Red Planet in 2024, Musk says. Mars is a long way away, though, so the people wouldn’t actually arrive until 2025.

Before then, the plan is “establishing cargo flights to Mars”, getting the first delivery there by 2018 in the company’s planned “Red Dragon” ships. A rocket every two years or so after that could provide a base for the people arriving in 2024 to survive.

No stranger to mild megalomania, Musk pondered what it would mean to be the head of the company shipping the first people to Mars, and decided he’d be in a position to decide the government of the planet. Although he felt that direct democracy would work best, he also declared himself “King of Mars”. You can vote for any leader you want, as long as it’s Elon.

Not every late car is Tesla’s fault

The Model X was famously delayed by a number years, and for many analysts, Tesla’s biggest roadblock ahead is scaling up from a niche manufacturer to a mainstream company. But Musk pointed out that not every delay to the Model X was something in Tesla’s control.



One shipment of carpets for the car boots, for instance, was caught up in a shoot-out on the Mexican border. “Border patrol wouldn’t give us the truck because it had bullet holes in it”, he said, adding that other delays came because of tsunamis, hailstorms, factories burning down, sinking ships and earthquakes. “One thing that makes a car very difficult is it’s an integrative product with thousands of components,” he added, and so delays tend to cascade. “Things move as fast as the least lucky and least competent supplier.”



Only one AI firm actually scares him

He won’t say which one (but we’re going to guess that it starts with G and rhymes with “we’re all going to die at the hands of super-intelligent robotsoogle”).

And only one tech company is a Tesla competitor

But this time it’s not Google. “They’re not a car company, so they’d potentially license to other companies. I wouldn’t say they’re a competitor.”

Apple, however? “That’ll be more direct,” he admitted. The Apple car is the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley, and the company has even poached several Tesla engineers – something Musk has been rather dismissive of. And even now, he’s not particularly concerned, estimating that Apple won’t be able to make a lot of cars till around 2020. “Is that too late?”, he asked. We think we know his answer.

Musk is going to go to orbit

For someone so into spaceflight that he’s built his own rocket ships, it’s odd that Musk hasn’t been in to space himself. But he says it’s on his to-do list.

“I’ll probably go to orbit in four to five years,” he said. “Orbit is really different than space.”

So there you have it. Musk in space. But is space just a simulation?"

Why would Musk say this? Because he is one of those aliens.

It’s easy to get a kick out of Musk’s quirky quotables. But the closer you look at his words and actions, the more you’ll start to see: He’s an alien who came from another galaxy to help save humanity. Here’s proof.

SpaceX

SpaceX is just a front so he can have somewhere to store his own space transportation vehicles without raising suspicion. (All those “failed” launches—totally staged.) Why is Musk so hell-bent on getting rockets to leave our atmosphere? Because eventually, he needs to get home.

The plan to blow up Mars

Musk raised more than Stephen Colbert’s eyebrows when he recommended that we “drop thermonuclear weapons over the poles” of Mars. Why would anyone want to lob nukes at an innocent planet? He claims it might warm the atmosphere up enough to make Mars hospitable. But he really wanted to destroy it. I mean, if your own race had long been at odds with the extraterrestrials that reside on Mars, you’d want to blow them up, too. It’s part of the reason he came to Earth. Luckily there now seems to be some kind of treaty in place.

The plan to land on Mars

People are onto his plan and now he keeps making the Mars jokes to throw us off track.

The plan to “die” on Mars

Musk has said several times that he wants to retire and expire on the Red Planet. But this is really just so people won’t notice that he went back to his own planet.

Tesla

No entrepreneur in their right mind would get into the electric vehicle business, which currently represents only about 0.1 percent of all cars sold. Yet Musk is pouring billions into his “secret master plan” to get transportation off fossil fuels, reduce global emissions, and therefore prevent a catastrophic warming of the planet. What’s more, he proposed this way before we even knew how much trouble we were in.

Autopilot

He accidentally put the autonomous feature on Tesla’s cars too early, forgetting that humans weren’t as intelligent as his own race.

Advertisement

Powerwalls

What’s really inside those Tesla Powerwalls? That’s just it: No one knows.

The Gigafactory

No one needs a factory that big. He had to build it that big so the giant solar array on the roof would be powerful enough to help him communicate with his friends back home. Which is also why he wants to build an internet in space.

Advertisement

His knowledge of the sun

“A lot of people don’t appreciate that our sun is a giant fusion explosion,” he said last year. He’s right—people never would.

Advertisement

His knowledge of interplanetary law

Why would he have an entire proposal for how to run a government on another planet? Because he ran a government on another planet.

Advertisement

His knowledge of how comfortable Dragon 2 would be for traveling through the Solar System

BECAUSE HE ALREADY DID IT.

He lives in Bel-Air

Come on, buying a house in Bel-Air is something you’d do if the only things you knew about LA were from what you learned on TV shows.

Advertisement

His ex-wife affectionally calls him a cyborg

“I do think of him as the Terminator. He locks his gaze on to something and says, ‘It shall be mine.’ Bit by bit, he won me over.” This is something that Justine Musk, his ex-wife, actually said.

The Hyperloop



Sure, it’s not a new idea. But no one paid attention to this concept until he proposed it and gave us a few hints about how to do it right. This idea—which makes a lot more sense in a place without an Earth-like atmosphere—is obviously the way they get around back where he comes from. And the fact that he just left the idea out there, letting all these Earthbound companies get the glory? Brilliant.

Bioweapon Defense Mode

And apparently we’re gonna need this Tesla feature. Because...

He keeps warning us about World War III

“I think we need to acknowledge that there’s certainly a possibility of a third World War, and if that does occur it could be far worse than anything that’s happened before,” he said last year. Ominous as fuck! HE KNOWS.

Advertisement

He keeps warning us about the robot apocalypse

Why do you think he started Open AI? Why doesn’t he want autonomous military tech? Why is he worried that Google is becoming too powerful? He’s seen it all happen before, you guys. He’s here to stop it.

He can travel through time

Musk makes weird comments all the time where it’s completely obvious that he already knows what’s going to happen. Consider last night’s exchange with Joshua Topolsky at the Code conference:

Advertisement

How could he have possibly guessed that Topolsky was going to ask that?

Another example: He called Apple’s car a missed opportunity. Apple’s car has not even been made yet—how would he know? Only if he had already seen it. By traveling through time.

He doesn’t behave like a human

He has been known to sleep at his desk (because he doesn’t need to sleep, obviously) and he thinks cars are built like babies. Then he tries to share things that make him seem like he has emotions, but he fails.

He met with Trump in the White House, surprisingly endorsed former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, and kicked off the second phase of his Hyperloop competition.

But in classic Musk fashion, he still set aside some time to talk about some of his more whimsical plans, like a tunnel under Los Angeles and "" neural lace.""

In that context, we decided to round up Musk's 13 craziest ideas yet. Scroll down for a closer look:"

He wants to save lives by making safer, self-driving cars, and save humanity by starting a colony on Mars. But he also wants to save humanity from traffic.

Elon Musk thinks being stuck in traffic is “soul-destroying” — but, he has a solution: tunnels. Musk has been tweeting about tunnels for a month now, and even said he’s going to build a tunnel boring machine and start digging. In developed cities, we can’t widen roadways, and elevated highways are ugly. So, we dig.

“Without tunnels, we will all be in traffic hell forever,” Musk told The Verge via Twitter DM today. “I really do think tunnels are the key to solving urban gridlock. Being stuck in traffic is soul-destroying. Self-driving cars will actually make it worse by making vehicle travel more affordable.”

No word on if “The Boring Company” is a real thing (or part of SpaceX of Tesla) or not — we’ve asked Musk for some additional details — but we know he dreams big and it wouldn’t be wise to count him out. Musk tweeted yesterday that he was going to start digging in “a month or so,” starting across from his desk at SpaceX in Los Angeles. Somehow I suspect Musk’s tunnel boring won’t be boring."

That’s a technical term for direct cortical interface, and it’s something that the SpaceX and Tesla CEO takes very seriously, in case you thought he might just be having a laugh.

Musk discussed the potential of a functional neural lace at Recode’s Code conference last year, speaking earnestly about its benefits in terms of being able to help humans keep pace with advancements in AI that threaten to render us vastly inferior to complex virtual intelligences.

Maybe next month — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017

Here’s how Musk described the potential of a neural lace in terms of solving human limitations when it comes to computing, and helping us keep pace with AI’s progress:

The fundamental limitation is input/output. We’re already a cyborg, I mean you have a digital or partial version of yourself in the form of your emails and your social media and all the things that you do and you have basically superpowers with your computer and your phone and the applications that are there. You have more power than the president of the united states had 20 years ago. you can answer any question, you can videoconference with anyone anywhere, you can send a message to anyone instantly, you can just do incredible things. But the constraint is input/output. We’re I/O bound – particularly output bound. Your output level is so low, particularly on a phone, your two thumbs sort of tapping away. This is ridiculously slow. Our input is much better because we have a high-bandwidth visual interface to the brain, our eyes take in a lot of data. So there’s many orders of magnitude difference between input and output. Effectively merging in a symbiotic way with digital intelligence revolves around eliminating the I/O constraint, which would be some sort of direct cortical interface […] a neural lace.

He went on to specify that this would potentially require only minimally invasive procedures, since “veins and arteries […] provide a complete roadway to all of your neurons, since they’re high blood flow.”

This isn’t the first time Musk has tweeted about making progress on the neural lace concept; he said in August that he might have something to share on the subject in a few months time, which fits loosely with a potential update on the subject next month, which he suggested this morning."

Everything you do from, basically, nursery school onward, is directed at receiving that all important fat envelope from the university of your dreams.

But super-entrepreneur Elon Musk has a message for both degree-obsessed young people and companies desperate to hire them: chill out already.

When asked in a 2014 interview about what university degrees he looks for on a resume, Musk explained that though credentials can be a nice signal of someone's abilities, they are absolutely not a prerequisite for achieving incredible things (or getting hired by Musk).

More evidence we're way too obsessed with degrees.

Given, as Musk points out, that some of the best-known names in tech -- from Bill Gates to Larry Ellison to Steve Jobs -- failed to graduate, the fact that greatness and gold-plated degrees don't always go together seems hard to argue with.

And that's not only true when you're talking about revolutionary geniuses. One recent analysis of job postings found that, to save themselves the hassle of sifting through more resumes, companies are increasingly demanding degrees for positions whose current occupants perform perfectly well without them. This degree inflation means companies end up paying 30 percent more for talent than they need to.

How to thrive without a degree.

The takeaway for hiring managers is pretty simple: yes, using degrees as shorthand for ability is a time saver, but it's also costly. You'll end up paying more for your people than you need to and also miss out on some exceptional talent.

But as AngelList noted when it recently flagged the Musk video in its weekly newsletter, Musk's dismissive attitude toward academic accolades should also serve as a reminder to young people that, if you put all your energy into grades and diplomas, you're almost certainly not focusing enough on what really matters -- skills, and the ability to continue updating them throughout your career.

Naval Ravikant, co-founder of AngelList, offered three pieces of advice to those starting out in the newsletter:

What to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long. The best teachers are on the internet. The best books are on the internet. The best peers are on the internet. The tools for learning are abundant. It's the desire to learn that's scarce."

December 18, 2017 2 min read

A whopping 16.7 million people follow Elon Musk on Twitter, where he shares his musings about how artificial intelligence is a danger, updates about progress at SpaceX and Tesla and, lately, jokes about selling merchandise for his latest venture, The Boring Company.

I know it’s a little off-brand, but kids love it — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 11, 2017

It’s true that Musk is working on a lot of intriguing, high profile projects, but those aren’t the only things that make the currently self-described “hat salesman,” a Twitter power user. Stacy Minero, Twitter’s Director of Brand Strategy, says that in addition to breaking news on Twitter, Musk is adept at using the platform to make his customers and fans feel heard.

“He responds to tweets from everyday followers, which just blows up Twitter because it's like an adrenaline rush when he responds to you. He takes advice,” Minero explains. “[He] has this direct connection with users that that makes people feel special and makes them feel like there's a spotlight on them.”

But that conversation also extends to actual change. Minero cited one interaction in which a Connecticut-based customer shared with Musk that people were using a Tesla charging station in the area for parking instead of simply charging like they were supposed to.

“[After that tweet,] he instituted a rule that you could charge for 30 to 45 minutes and after that you would incur a fee,” Minero says. “So actually listening to feedback from customers as a way to improve either service or products. That's one of the things you can do on Twitter as a CEO, is use it as a live learning lab to actually improve products and services.”

Who are some other CEOs and founders you like to follow on Twitter? Let us know in the comments."
https://la.curbed.com/2017/12/18/16748436/elon-musk-tunnels-los-angeles-criticism-explained,pos,1.0,5.965623684950334e-21,Elon Musk’s LA tunnels: Why experts are so skeptical,2017-12-18 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:48:20.478435,Dec,"Elon Musk has made no secret that he wants to solve Los Angeles’ traffic woes with underground tunnels, where cars could bolt below the city at speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. The billionaire entrepreneur says his project, dubbed Loop, would be a “significant public benefit” that unsnarls traffic.

He claims he can finish burrowing a 17-mile tunnel between Sherman Oaks and LAX by the end of 2018.

It’s also no secret that Musk’s accomplishments fall short of his big aspirations. In November, Rolling Stone described him as having “managed to sell the world on his capability to achieve objectives so lofty that from the mouth of anyone else, they'd be called fantasies,” without ever having to back them up.

Building tunnels beneath Los Angeles is not likely to be an exception.

The Boring Company, Musk’s tunneling company, is already at work building a test track beneath a two-mile stretch of 120th Street in Hawthorne, and it has applied for permits from the city of Los Angeles to do more tunneling. But large infrastructure projects require much, much more than building permits.

State law demands that they be heavily scrutinized. There’s rigorous environmental analysis, public hearings and outreach, and government reviews before they can even break ground. The Expo Line we know today, for example, was first studied by Metro in 2000.

Three construction and transportation experts we interviewed said, more or less, that Musk’s talk of building a tunnel by the end of next year is just that—talk.

Reached by Curbed, a spokesperson for Boring Company dismissed the criticism, and alluded to the fact that Musk has previously broken into two industries—with Tesla and SpaceX—experts once said it would be challenging to thrive in.

“It’s important to frame The Boring Company in this context,” wrote spokesperson Sam Teller. “Elon has built successful companies in two of the most technologically complex and highly regulated industries on earth. Thorny regulatory frameworks are a fact of life, not an insurmountable obstacle.”

That said, here are five reasons experts said Angelenos should all be skeptical of Musk and his claims:

1. Environmental analysis alone would take years

Big construction projects, like Musk’s tunnel, are strictly regulated by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). It requires a fastidious environmental impact review (EIR) designed to rigorously evaluate any and all potential impacts a project could have. Along with an exhaustive analysis of a project’s effect on its local environment, the EIR process generally requires extensive public outreach.

“Technology doesn’t take precedence over the environmental process,” says Joshua Schank, the leader of Metro’s Office of Extraordinary Innovation. “You can have the fastest tunneling machines and the greatest mode of transport, but none of that affects the political or environmental process.”

Juan Matute, the associate director of UCLA Lewis Center and the Institute of Transportation Studies, where he also teaches a CEQA course, agrees.

“CEQA review is a very long process. It can vary project to project, but given how new this is, that it’s a novel technology with, maybe, novel construction methods, there isn’t precedent,” Matute says. “If it’s truly something new, you actually don’t have to just produce the paper, you have to do the full analysis. So, it would go through the community process.”

He estimates the EIR would take at least three to four years—even longer if someone sued. Metro’s Schank points out that the point of the entire environmental analysis is to make sure the public has ample opportunity to raise objections or concerns about a proposed project.

“California requires a substantial amount of community outreach and due process before a project can begin,” says Schank. “We live in a democracy, and we’ve decided that no single entity can simply start construction without a rigorous examination.”

2. There are lots of risks where Musk wants to tunnel

Matute says there are plenty of other state laws that govern where construction or tunneling can and cannot take place. For example, risks like old oil wells and earthquake faults, both common in subterranean west Los Angeles, come with their own construction rules.

The Boring Company tunnel under LA A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Oct 28, 2017 at 1:51pm PDT

“Elon has released only about 0.1 percent of the details needed to evaluate the merits or environmental impacts of the proposal,” says Matute. “There are profound generalized impacts and countless specific hazards, like oil wells, that will mire bored tunnels in years of environmental review.”

The point of these rules, perhaps obviously, is to minimize risk during construction and operation. Reasons to not tunnel through earthquake faults are obvious. Oil wells carry the risk of methane fueled explosions, like the one that blew out a Ross Dress For Less store in 1985.

These types of risks dictate the exact route Musk’s hypothetical tunnel could eventually take under Los Angeles. Only after an exact route is determined could Musk move onto the next stage of the construction process.

3. Musk needs permission from property owners to drill beneath their land

Should his project make it through the environmental review process, Musk would also need permission from property owners—both public and private—to dig below their land. This process is called easement, and it can be extraordinarily challenging. For example, Beverly Hills’ refusal to grant Metro easement for its Westside subway extension tied up the project for nearly two decades.

“The best way to do this would be to negotiate with the state of California and build it under the freeway system,” Matute says. “But those roads are built for 65 mph, not more than 100, and you’re going to need to take wider turns. Inevitably it’ll go under private property, and all it takes one person’s refusal before you have to re-engineer everything.”

Experts say if Musk were to try and build alone, it would be virtually impossible for him to get the necessary easements. Public agencies such as Metro are empowered by law to use eminent domain to use private property for public purposes, but there’s no equivalent a private business.

“The biggest question for me with a project like this is if you have the right to in order to pass underneath all these private properties,” says David Schmidt, COO of Skanska USA, part of the construction company that’s building Metro’s Regional Connector and the Westside Subway (it also built the Expo Line). “It takes an enormous amount of effort on the part of a public agency when they want to do a tunneling project. As a private company, I don’t know how you would actually pull that off very easily. So much would have to be granted from the city, it would have to be a public private partnership.”

Across the road and below the ground A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jun 29, 2017 at 11:35pm PDT

Similarly, UCLA’s Matute says existing legal barriers might be so great, that Musk might have better luck lobbying the state legislature to exempt the project.

“If I were Elon Musk, and I had a lot of money and not a lot of patience, I would look to the state legislature to exempt the project,” says Matute. “And that is a lobbying process. Whether or not that’s politically viable at this moment, and whether or not it could still be challenged, can be an open question.”

Incidentally, in October, the Boring Company hired Capitol Strategies Group to lobby in Sacramento.

4. Tunnels would probably cause more traffic

Ironically, the experts we spoke with seem to think that Musk’s project might actually end up making more traffic. The problem boils down to the fact that there would be limited surface space for people to enter the tunnel, which would likely mean users would have to queue up.

“The demand for public transit on the Sepulveda corridor is huge,” says Metro’s Schank. “The 405 is jammed all day every day, and putting a few people into a pod isn’t going to make much of a difference. The congestion at the entry points and exit points would be enormous. You can’t improve the capacity in the corridor without addressing how people get to the corridor itself.”

Matute pointed out the same issue. “If it’s a four minute trip from Brentwood to Hawthorne, but there’s a 20 minute line to get into the tube, you haven’t really done much,” he says.

5. Who will benefit?

There’s the question of how much it would cost to use. Musk has repeated multiple times that he would build and operate Loop without any public money. This means that if the system were ever to become operational, it would likely employ a toll-style fare system for use. Federal law requires that large transportation projects be accessible to people of all different income levels.

“When you’re building a major transportation project, you can’t just build it for a privileged class of users. Access has to be provided for everyone,” Schank says. “Federal law says you can’t build a new transportation system that would going to disproportionately benefit the wealthy.”

The question then becomes how much would it cost to use, and whether or not an equitable system would be financially viable.

“Technically, I don’t think it’s that hard. But, for me, I think, ‘Why would you run cars in it? Why wouldn’t you run fixed rail?’” said Schmidt. “I don’t know for a fact, but it seems to me you can certainly have more people riding on a train than in cars on sleds. You’d want to really look at what kind of volume you can move through the tunnel to make the call about how viable a project like this would be.”

But Musk doesn’t like the public transit. He called it a “pain in the ass” in an interview with Wired this month.

“That’s why everyone doesn’t like it,” Musk said. ”And there’s like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that’s why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.”"

And billionaire tech titan and SpaceX boss Elon Musk is working on an aggressive and admittedly ambitious time schedule to get there — in particular to Mars. What would it be like to travel to Mars in Musk's spaceship? The first trip to Mars is planned for 2022, which is an ""aspirational"" date, according to Musk. ""I feel fairly confident we can build the ship and be prepared for launch in about five years,"" Musk says. That first voyage to Mars, however, would carry cargo but no people.

The orbits of Mars and Earth only sync up every two years, so the next chance for a trip to Mars would be in 2024, and that's when Musk wants to send two rockets with passengers. To get to Mars, Musk and his team at SpaceX have designed the spaceship, currently referred to by its codename, ""BFR,"" and have built the facility where it will be produced.

I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars. Elon Musk SpaceX CEO

The flight to Mars will take between three and six months, says Musk. As such, passengers will share cabins. Each one of 40 cabins could fit between five and six passengers but will be more comfortable for two or three people. So Musk estimates each rocket will comfortably transport about 100 passengers to Mars on a single flight. The cabins in the rocket to Mars will be 9 meters, or about 30 feet, in diameter, Musk says. That means the cabin will he 825 cubic meters, or bigger than the cabin of an A380, the large, luxurious commercial airline often used for international flights. There will be a storage area, galley and entertainment area on the spaceship, says Musk. ""I think probably a good situation for at least BFR version one,"" says Musk of the travel conditions.

Musk tweeted the five-part video simulation of the SpaceX plan to get to Mars embedded above on September 25, 2017. It is based off 2016 plans, but gives a good feel of what the journey to Mars could be like. ""The great thing about going to space is there is no friction, so once you are out of the atmosphere, it is smooth as silk — no turbulence, nothing. There is no weather, there is no atmosphere,"" he explains. Upon arrival on Mars, one of the first differences space travelers will notice is the color of the night sky — as it's reverse of what you experience on Earth: ""Blue sunrise and sunset, Red during the day,"" Musk tweets, responding to a photo posted by World and Science. Also, upon landing, the very first Mars visitors will step out onto a ""rocky, dusty ground,"" says Musk, describing the surface of the Red Planet. Visitors — especially the first pioneering space travelers — won't arrive with anything waiting for them. Musk's dream is to make the first step. ""Our goal is get you there and ensure the basic infrastructure for ... survival is in place. A rough analogy is that we are trying to build the equivalent of the transcontinental railway. A vast amount of industry will need to be built on Mars by many other companies and millions of people,"" says Musk, via a Reddit Ask me Anything. That also means you won't be able to post your epic Instagram shots immediately. When asked whether Mars travelers would be able to communicate back with Earth, Musk says: ""If anyone wants to build a high bandwidth comm link to Mars, please do."" But eventually, with further missions, crews will build cities on Mars: ""Over time, terraforming Mars and making it a nice place to be,"" says Musk.

To get back to planet Earth, the first missions will also have to build fuel depots on Mars, Musk says. Musk's mission is rooted in both a belief that a large extinction event will make the Earth uninhabitable and his persistent, unfettered optimism for the future. He founded his Hawthorne, Calif.-based aeronautics company in 2002 to ""revolutionize space technology"" and enable multiplanitary human existence.

""Fundamentally, the future is vastly more exciting and interesting if we are a space faring civilization and multi planetary species than if we are not. You want to be inspired by things. You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great and that is what being a space-faring civilization is all about,"" says Musk. ""It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.""

After all, the 46-year-old inventor and investor shoots rockets into space, talks confidently of colonizing Mars, and has built in Tesla a car and solar energy company that the market values at tens of billions of dollars despite it having yet to turn a profit.

But I believe I know something that Musk doesn’t: Transportation systems don’t just get us from point A to point B. They shape the entire way cities look and feel and grow.

Let me back up a bit. One of Musk’s current big ideas is to build a vast network of tunnels underneath greater Los Angeles. Cars riding on wheeled platforms called “electric skates” would speed along at more than 120 miles per hour. “You should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX in five or six minutes,” Musk said in a TED Talk interview earlier this year. That drew great applause from the audience: Interstate 405, the highway that now carries most traffic the 10 miles between the Los Angeles neighborhood and the airport, is the nation’s most congested.

This vision is not just a pipe dream. His tunnel-boring company -- called the Boring Company, of course -- has already been given permission to dig a 1.6-mile test tunnel underneath Hawthorne, Calif., where the company is headquartered. It’s now under construction. (The Boring Company was also recently given permission to dig a 10.1-mile tunnel in Maryland as part of Musk’s proposed “hyperloop” transportation system.) Crucial to Musk’s idea is that he envisions developing cheaper tunnel-boring technology -- so cheap that one could essentially build an infinite number of tunnels underground. “You can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network,” Musk has said.

But while the engineering vision is incredible, Musk doesn’t seem to know much about how transportation affects what is around it. Musk, like many people, apparently thinks of transportation simply as getting from one place to another. But as I wrote in my first book, How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl and the Roads Not Taken, if you create a well-used new way of moving, you create a new way of living. Subways created subway cities. Streetcars created streetcar suburbs. The postwar interstates created linear cities along the superhighways’ spines. And Los Angeles’ elevated freeways and limited-access roads created sprawling neighborhoods below that, to this day, people both love and love to hate.

With this in mind, you can see where Musk goes wrong. He talks of the built environment as if it were static -- as if you could have all of these tunnels going between places and nothing would change up on the ground.

But of course if you had high-speed tunnels under Los Angeles, developers would build to dovetail with them: things like apartments, office buildings and retail. Churches and schools would spring up in new places. Musk envisions his tunnels as helping get people to Pasadena in minutes. But if these tunnels really work, then Pasadena would have new residents living there, and it and wouldn’t be like present-day Pasadena anymore. Giant parking garages might develop above tunnel stations. Or if some driverless car scenario minimizes the need for parking, even-denser collections of apartments and shopping and office centers would come.

Sure, Musk’s envisioned L.A. tunnel system looks pretty cool. An animated video on the Boring Company website shows what looks like a Tesla sports car in torturously slow regular traffic on a city street. Then, like some Q-designed vehicle in a James Bond movie, the car rolls onto an electric skate in the parking lane. The skate drops down beneath the surface and is ferried off to the tunnel system. The skate-carried car rockets along at a breathtaking speed until it is delivered back up to a surface street, where the driver continues on his or her journey.

But you can see the shallowness (forgive the pun) of Musk’s thinking in that in the videos these deep tunnels have only a light amount of traffic in them. In the real world, of course, they would fill up very quickly. I was reminded of the influential Swiss architect and planner Le Corbusier from the 1920s, whose sketches of his proposed new cities of towers showed only a few cars on their highways. We all know how that worked out.

I was curious as to what Musk or an associate would say about my criticisms, but I couldn’t get anyone to talk to me. I did reach a Boring Company spokesperson, who referred me to their website’s FAQ section. There, I found a very interesting discussion about the engineering aspects of the tunnels, but nothing about land use.

So how could a new layer of cheaper tunnels be put to more beneficial use than what Musk envisions? Well, it may not sell many Teslas, but one answer might be a more complete subway or bus system, combined with bicycling and walking networks aboveground. The nice thing about those is that we have a history of pleasant urban spaces being built around them and some models to work with.

Whatever is done, one should always remember that transportation determines land use, either by design or in unintended ways. Another lesson is that one should be wary of geniuses bearing gifts. They may be well-intentioned, but they may not know everything about what their packages contain."

Elon Musk is a lot of things. Billionaire, space adventurer, transport revolutionary, but not, he says, the inventor of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency coin that crossed the $10,000 valuation threshold early on Tuesday.

Musk, co-founder of PayPal, Tesla boss and CEO of Space Exploration Technologies, responded to a blogpost circulating on several crypto-currency sites claiming that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin who has never been conclusively identified.

“Not true,” Musk said on Tuesday in a tweet. “A friend sent me part of a BTC [bitcoin] a few years, but I don’t know where it is.”

Musk was responding to a post on Medium last week in which writer Sahil Gupta floated the idea that based on Musk’s history of innovation across tech disciplines, his understanding of economics and cryptography and his coding abilities, it was possible that he was the author of the original document that proposed a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, “cryptocurrency” – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.

The speculation comes as Bitcoin’s astonishing rise in valuation is prompting new warnings of an asset bubble. Bitcoin’s value has surged more than tenfold this year and has jumped by 20% in the last three days alone. The total value of bitcoin in circulation now exceeds the stock market values of companies including Boeing, McDonald’s and Disney.

In his post, Gupta suggested that even if Musk is not the originator, the sector needs his expertise. Membership of Coinbase, one of the largest platforms for trading cryptocurrency, has almost tripled to 13 million in the past year.

“If Elon is Satoshi, it seems like this knowledge would become public at some point anyway. But if it were public now, Elon could offer guidance as the currency’s ‘founding father’.”

The dizzying surge in valuation is reportedly melting the resolve of cryptocurrencies’ fiercest critics.

In September, the JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, said if he found employees trading cryptocurrency, he would “fire them in a second, for two reasons: It is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous”.

Dimon is now said be considering systems to help clients trade contracts linked to the cryptocurrency.

Musk meanwhile is pressing ahead with efforts to revolutionize transport systems. His private space-launch company SpaceX, currently valued at $21.5bn, is ramping up its launch schedule of rockets that are able to take off, deliver a payload into space, then land back on a platform stationed in the Atlantic, to every two to three weeks.

In May, SpaceX laid out plans to put 4,425 satellites into space to provide global high-speed internet. The SpaceX CEO said he wants to land at least two cargo ships on Mars by 2022.

Musk’s more prosaic, earthly ambitions, also continue to unfold. Earlier this month, Musk unveiled Tesla’s first electric semi-truck.

With typical hyperbole, Musk vowed that the new truck would “blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension”.

The new vehicle, he claims, will reduce the overall cost to 20% less per mile compared with diesel trucks and boast faster acceleration, better uphill performance, a 500-mile (805km) range at maximum weight at highway speed, and “thermonuclear explosion-proof glass” in the windshield.

Once again, ""Star Trek"" has me thinking about the future.

But rather than the likelihood of far-off tech like warp drive or transporters, Sunday's installment on CBS All Access of ""Star Trek: Discovery"" has me wondering about super-entrepreneur Elon Musk's place in history. (Disclosure: CBS is CNET's parent company.)

The show, set in the 23rd century, briefly name-checked the Tesla Motors and SpaceX founder in a short list of famous inventors that also included the Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of the warp drive.

Now playing: Watch this: 'Star Trek: Discovery' name checks Elon Musk

To be remembered and revered more than two centuries from now, Elon Musk would have to achieve some pretty remarkable tasks. He certainly has ambitions -- like colonizing Mars -- that are audacious enough to place him among history's most famed innovators.

But what are the odds that we remember his name 200 years from now?

Quitting while he's ahead

If Musk decided tomorrow that he's tired of running two major companies, helping his cousins run another (Solar City) and overseeing an ever-expanding number of speculative side projects including computer-brain interfaces (Neuralink), futuristic transit (Hyperloop) and tunnels (The Boring Company), his legacy might fade rather quickly. Still, he'd have to shut down all of the above efforts, forbid anyone else from taking them on and disappear to a desert island to finally do something besides work.

The notion that Musk would go full Howard Hughes seems unlikely, though. And even if he did go away suddenly, he's also far from the only person pursuing the goals of popularizing electric cars, increasing human access to space and revolutionizing high-speed transit on (or around) Earth. Also if any of his goals were still eventually achieved by others (and I would argue none of them is there quite yet) and were to play a major role in our society, then his legacy as a popularizer and early innovator of these concepts should guarantee him at least a footnote in future history e-books, a la Hughes or Amelia Earhart.

But what would it take for him to join the ranks of the Wrights, Edison, Da Vinci or, of course, the original Tesla?

Delivering the grand vision

Musk's greatest accomplishments so far are building Tesla Motors into a truly competitive automaker and making rockets reusable. Ironically, neither of these crowning achievements would likely put him on par with the Wright Brothers or someone who invents a real warp drive.

That's not to denigrate how truly impressive his feats are. Making electric cars sexy and desirable was laughable 20 years ago, and it's still cool to watch a Falcon 9 landing, even as that becomes de rigueur. But across the grand sweep of the history of transportation innovation, these are important incremental steps rather than revolutionary breakthroughs like flight or light-speed travel.

Even if we all end up driving EVs, I think we'd probably end up remembering Nikola Tesla before Tesla Motors in the 23rd century.

If the Hyperloop or 30-minute rocket rides become the preferred choice of travel in the future, Musk probably comes close to joining the Wright Brothers in the great pantheon of innovators remembered for years to come.

But if we're also taking rocket rides to colonies on Mars, the moon and beyond as Musk hopes, then, yes, I can see Star Trek's fictional future reference becoming a reality.

If that happens, I'm sure we'll be teaching about Musk's great ""Guadalajara moment"" in school just like we were taught about what happened at Kitty Hawk.

But as the cliche goes, ""space is hard"" and there's a lot of work to be done between landing a rocket on a droneship in the ocean and landing one carrying colonists on the Red Planet. There's also plenty of questions to answer, like: What about the toilet paper?

If Musk's name is associated with a successful off-Earth colony when it finally happens, though, he will earn much more than a footnote in history.

As cool as that sounds, Silicon Valley's version of Tony Stark hasn't said much about his mysterious Boring Company, which now employs six people and shares office space with SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Just what are its goals? How does he expect to disrupt tunneling? And when will LA traffic ever improve? Musk still isn't talking, but documents the Boring Company provided to the city of Hawthorne, and comments employees made to the city council, provide a few tidbits.

Those clues provide a clearer picture of what Musk is up to. Good thing, too, because the Hawthorne city council just gave the Boring Company permission to begin digging a 1.6-mile tunnel so it can test its technology. Which, by the way, doesn't seem terribly innovative so far.

The Boring Company

For those who've been too busy ordering a Tesla Model 3 or watching SpaceX launches to keep up with Musk's latest Big Idea: The Boring Company launched in January, less than a month after Musk tweeted a complain about Los Angeles traffic and pledged to ""build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging."" He envisions a transportation Upside Down that duplicates LA's maze of highways underground. But wait. It gets weirder. A series of tunnels—30 or even 40 levels of them—could shuttle individual cars on electric skates at more than 120 mph. Need to travel beyond the city? No problem. Elon's got a plan for that too. He's proposed a 200-mile tunnel connecting New York and Washington, DC, via hyperloop. (You remember hyperloop, yeah? That's Musk's plan to whisk people hither and yon in tubes at something like the speed of sound.)

To make this happen at cost and speed commensurate with his taste for disruption, Musk must first conquer tunneling. Like the stodgy space and auto industries, boring seems ripe for revolution. Digging any tunnel of consequence takes years, costs millions, and requires navigating labyrinthine bureaucracies. Seemingly minor problems can prove debilitating: When Seattle's boring machine, Big Bertha, unexpectedly hit a lead pipe and damaged its cutting blades, it spent two years stranded underground.

Musk thinks he can do it faster and cheaper than anyone else—including, presumably, this guy—by tweaking the tools and engineering. So he bought a used boring machine, named it Godot (the man sure does hate waiting), and dug a test trench 160 feet long and 16 feet deep in the SpaceX parking garage. Pleased by those results and eager to hone his skills, Musk wants to keep going beyond SpaceX property and into, or rather under, the city of Hawthorne. Now the city council has given it the go-ahead, after a vote of four to one. (There are still more a few more papers to sign before work on the tunnel can begin, including permits from state departments of transportation and labor.)

City of Hawthorne

The Test Tunnel

The Boring Company's plan calls for extending that tunnel 1.6 miles to a point somewhere beneath 120th Street. The company insists the five-month construction process won't interrupt traffic, and says locals won't even know there's work going on because the tunnel will be 22 to 44 feet beneath the surface of the road.

""We won't have construction crews walking down the street, we won’t have any trucks or excavators working in those areas,"" says Brett Horton, SpaceX's head of construction. ""Everything that we’re doing is underground."" (He said a number of SpaceX employees work for the Boring Company part-time.)

The tunnel will be a relatively trim 13.5 feet in diameter, just wide enough to test the electric skate—which appears to be the main point of digging this hole to begin with. ""The test tunnel project would involve SpaceX engineers repeatedly testing personal vehicle types suitable for placement on the skates; refinement of the design and technology; and general data collection on performance, durability, and application,"" the Boring Company wrote in documents submitted to the city council.

The company assured city leaders that no humans will travel through this tunnel or ride on the electric skates that will zip through it (though that sounds like a blast). It didn't explain why that testing must happen underground, and company officials declined to comment for this article.

Open Questions

Even less clear is what this tunnel has to do with Musk's plan to ratchet up boring speeds. ""We haven’t reinvented tunneling,"" Horton told the council members. ""We’re using a proven machine that was used in the Bay Area for a sewer project. We’re using proven technology and proven means and methods in terms of construction. Everything we’re doing has been done before.” Documents submitted to the council suggest Godot will bore 3 inches per minute, or 60 feet per day—no faster than the industry standard.

Instead, the company seems to consider this a big experiment, an opportunity to learn the tunnel boring biz, test a few hypotheses, and explore how it might make good on Musk's pledge to increase tunneling speeds by a factor of 14.

Folks who already understand how tunneling works express skepticism. ""What does Musk think, we’re all idiots?"" says Gary Brierley, who has been designing and managing the construction of tunnels and other projects in the LA area for 50 years. ""He thinks people who have been doing this all their lives wouldn’t improve this if they could?"" Brierley says running the actual machine is only one part of a huge process that simply takes time: constructing tunnel support walls behind the machine's cuts, hauling soil to the surface, monitoring deformation or damage as construction moves along. And that all comes after filing reports, obtaining permits, hiring contractors, and tending to the myriad other bureaucratic hassles that so rarely yield to promises of innovation and disruption.

""It’s all interesting what he’s doing,"" Brierley says. ""It’s not a bad thing that people are talking about tunnels."" And, to be fair to Musk, he has hushed critics who said he couldn't launch his own rockets or build a successful startup automaker."

To make a half-hour trip, the BFR would have to travel thousands of miles per hour, with a maximum speed of about 16,700 miles per hour, according to SpaceX. The flight would expose passengers to sensations they don’t usually encounter while traveling, like intense gravitational forces and weightlessness. The spaceship would definitely need to stock barf bags.

Musk explained in a tweet that travelers would experience g-forces between 2 and 3, which means twice or three times their body weight. “Will feel like a mild to moderate amusement park ride on ascent and then smooth, peaceful, and silent in zero gravity for most of the trip until landing,” he said.

“That may not be a very comfortable way to travel,” said Ge-Cheng Zha, a mechanical and aerospace professor at the University of Miami who studies supersonic flight. “Not everyone can take it.”

The ride will be most intense during landing and takeoff. The rapid acceleration and deceleration could lead to motion sickness. So could a quick peek out the window during a particularly twisty maneuver. “There’s a disconnect between the g-force and what the person sees, which can lead to severe motion sickness,” said Andy Feinberg, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland who studies astronaut health (and applied to be an astronaut himself in 1979).

Feinberg has flown aboard NASA’s now-retired zero-gravity plane, which simulates weightlessness by taking a series of dives. The speed of the aircraft matches the speed of the passengers as they fall, which creates the experience of free-falling. Feinberg remembers not everyone on board could handle the shifts.“The NASA people, the astronauts, and I were having the time of our lives,” he said. Everyone else around them was throwing up.

Aside from the flight experience and the discomfort it may bring, there’s a host of other factors Musk and his engineers will need to consider before the BFR becomes reality. While the actual trip may indeed take about a half-hour, preparing and unloading the passengers could take hours. The nature of the travel could increase the time required for security checks, luggage checks, and whatever new safety procedures flight attendants may have to present. (At least some flight attendants, for what it’s worth, seem game for the BFR. While it’s too soon to give a “definitive opinion” on rocket travel, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International, said flight attendants have the “flexibility to adapt to new conditions.”)

There’s also the question of fuel. Launching the BFR, which will stand 106 meters tall, nearly double the height of the Falcon 9, will require tremendous energy, Zha said. A rocket is much harder to get off the ground than, say, a supersonic plane, he said. The Concorde, a now-retired commercial supersonic airliner that carried passengers from New York to London in under three hours, among other destinations, used about three times as much fuel as a Boeing 747. “The reason we use rockets for space delivery is because there’s no other options,” Zha said. “On Earth, airplanes are way more efficient.”

The transport system will also face questions from the U.S. government and other nations in the BFR’s flight path about the rocket’s safety risks and environmental impact. The rocket’s introduction would require the regulation of an entirely new commercial industry.

Still, many won’t be deterred. The BFR doesn’t exist yet, so the coolness factor outweighs all others. Asked whether he would hitch a ride on the BFR, Feinberg said, “in a second.”"

""Why are you in here?"" NTB Scanpix/Heiko Junge/via REUTERS Most people don't like to have their time wasted with unnecessary meetings.

But Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX, has a strategy to keep things moving, a former SpaceX employee posted on Quora.

The former employee relayed a story where Musk once called out an employee in a meeting. He wrote:

""One of my close friends started there a couple years before me. He worked (and still does) in an analysis group, so meetings made less sense when you could just walk over and ask someone a question. He told me a story one time (this is paraphrased):

""Elon to a meeting member: 'You haven't said anything. Why are you in here?'""

The former employee further explained Musk's rationale for making such a blunt proclamation.

""That may be borderline rude, but it makes sense,"" he wrote. ""Don't be in a meeting unless there's a purpose for it; either to make a decision, or get people up to speed. In most cases, an email will suffice.""

Musk isn't the only CEO who values running an efficient meeting — Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and CEO, employs the ""two-pizza rule"" to cut down on meeting bloat.

His thinking is simple: Meetings should be small enough that two pizzas would feed the entire group. If not, the meeting would probably be too big and unproductive.

Bezos also told Fortune in 2012 that some meetings with senior executives began with silent reading time, during which all attendees familiarized themselves with a memo describing the matter at hand, took notes, and mulled over the issues before beginning the discussion. That way, he said, he gets everyone's attention immediately — because no one likes to waste time in a conference room."

An artist's rendering of what a Falcon Heavy rocket launch would look like. (SpaceX.)

Shortly after he founded SpaceX, Elon Musk paraded a mock-up of his Falcon 1 rocket down Independence Avenue in the nation's capital, with a police escort, hoping to get the attention of leaders in Washington. Later, he had a plan to land a greenhouse plant on Mars, which he hoped would reinvigorate interest in space.

Since then, his rocket company has pulled off an array of increasingly important — and improbable — feats, from winning billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts to landing rocket boosters on ships at sea.

But nothing would quite solidify Musk’s merry-prankster, ringmaster status than his recently announced plan to use the often-delayed launch of his Falcon Heavy rocket into a cross-promotional marketing campaign for Tesla, one of his other companies. In tweets on Friday and Saturday, Musk said that SpaceX plans to pursue putting a Tesla Roadster on to the top of the rocket, launching it into an orbit around Mars, while playing David Bowie’s “Space Oddity.”

Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn’t blow up on ascent. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 2, 2017

Why?

“I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future,” he wrote on Twitter.

After some confusion Saturday over whether he was serious or not, the plan was confirmed by the company, which appeared to be taken aback that it was tweeted out seemingly spontaneously.

SpaceX, which had hoped to launch Falcon Heavy years ago, has said that after several delays it would finally launch in January from Launch Complex 39A, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the site of many of NASA’s historic Apollo and space shuttle launches.

The Falcon Heavy is an incredibly complex vehicle, with 27 engines, all of which have to be fired at once. This year, Musk conceded that the rocket was “way, way more difficult than we originally thought. We were pretty naïve about that.”

It's so complex that the chances of it blowing up on its maiden flight were high. “I hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage. I would consider even that a win,” he said. “Major pucker factor, really. There’s no other way to describe it.”

Skeptics will see the launch as a stunt designed to bolster SpaceX and Tesla — his two companies — while also deflecting attention from their respective woes — the delay of the Falcon Heavy and the backlog of Tesla vehicles.

But there will be other concerns, as well. SpaceX will need the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency will have to ensure that a car in space “does not jeopardize public health and safety, safety of property, U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, or international obligations of the United States,” according to the FAA.

Then there is the moral calculus. Should SpaceX be launching a car instead of satellites that could help NASA and scientists?

“I have to wonder if something a little more useful could be done on this first Falcon Heavy flight — like auctioning off the $200,000 Tesla Roadster and using the proceeds to fund a hundred or so cubesats that could be given out free to students with the caveat that they may become space toast,” Keith Cowing wrote on his blog, NASA Watch. CubeSats are miniaturized satellites used for space research.

“This is a chance to do something that really resonates with people. Instead a lot of people will see some guy throw his expensive car away in outer space or make a shiny red reef in the Atlantic,” Cowing wrote."

Musk first tweeted out the idea on Friday evening, and the payload was confirmed on Saturday.

But confirmation followed a bizarre exchange between The Verge and Musk. After Musk tweeted the plan, we asked him to confirm that it was real. Musk replied to us first by email, confirming that it was real. Then, after The Verge published a story about the plan, Musk sent us a response in a direct message on Twitter saying he “totally made it up.” We now know that response was false; a person familiar with the matter told The Verge Saturday evening that the payload is in fact real.

The first Falcon Heavy’s “payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity,” Musk wrote on Twitter, referencing the famous David Bowie song. “Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn’t blow up on ascent.”

Musk has spoken openly about the non-zero chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode during its first flight, and because of that he once said he wanted stick the “silliest thing we can imagine” on top of the rocket. Now we know what he meant. It’s unclear at the time of publish whether SpaceX has received any necessary approvals for this plan.

The “silliest [payload] we can imagine,” indeed

Falcon Heavy is the followup to SpaceX’s Falcon 9. It’s a more powerful rocket that the company hopes to use for missions to the Moon and Mars. It was originally supposed to take flight back in 2013 or 2014, but its maiden flight is now pegged for January 2018, according to Musk. (The company has been testing parts of the Falcon Heavy architecture over the last year, and has been busy readying the same launchpad that the Apollo 11 mission blasted off from for this flight.)

Falcon Heavy is, in overly simple terms, three of the company’s Falcon 9 rockets strapped together. It therefore will be capable of creating around three times the thrust of a single Falcon 9 rocket, allowing SpaceX to perform missions beyond low Earth orbit.

SpaceX also ultimately plans to be able to recover all three rocket cores that power the Falcon Heavy, just like it’s done over the last year with main rocket booster stage of its Falcon 9s. It’s unclear if the company will attempt to recover the boosters of this maiden rocket.

Of course, Musk also said earlier this fall at the International Astronautical Congress that he plans to pour all of SpaceX’s resources into an even bigger rocket architecture, known as the Interplanetary Transport System (or Big Fucking Rocket, for short).

That new mega-rocket, when built, would essentially obsolesce the Falcon Heavy and the Falcon 9. It will be capable of taking on the same duties that those rockets perform, while adding new capabilities that range from planting a colony on Mars to making 30-minute transcontinental travel possible on Earth.

In that light, maybe shooting a Tesla into orbit around the Red Planet doesn’t seem so outlandish.

Update: Elon Musk does plan to launch his Tesla Roadster to Mars with SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket launch, company officials reportedly confirmed on Saturday.

In a series of tweets on Friday night, Elon Musk said he plans to launch his red Tesla Roadster to Mars orbit in 2018.

Multiple sources now confirm Musk is serious, even if the tech mogul and billionaire had a good laugh or two at the expense of journalists over the weekend. Based on Musk's history and the reported capabilities of his new rocket, there's good reason to believe him.

In 2010, Musk launched a wheel of cheese into orbit during the maiden voyage of Dragon, a spaceship built by his aerospace company, SpaceX. And in March, Musk said he plans to launch ""[s]illiest thing we can imagine"" during the first flight of Falcon Heavy. The rocket is SpaceX's biggest and newest launcher, and one that's capable of sending a payload of 37,000 pounds (or nearly 14 Tesla Roadsters' worth of mass) to Mars.

The inaugural Falcon Heavy launch will occur in January 2018, Musk confirmed this week.

""Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit,"" Musk tweeted on Friday, referencing the song by David Bowie. ""Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent.""

SpaceX Musk seemed to further confirm his plans in an impromptu question-and-answer session that evening.

""Just to reiterate, the payload for the first Falcon Heavy rocket will be a Tesla electric car, playing Space Oditty, heading for Mars,"" wrote a user named J.C.

""Yes,"" Musk answered.

Will it be a first-generation 2008 Roadster?

""Yeah,"" Musk replied to another user.

Another person asked about the midnight cherry-red paint on Musk's roadster.

""Red car for a red planet,"" Musk replied.

SpaceX employees also appeared to confirm the claim. Joy Dunn, an engineer at the company, tweeted on Friday that the first Falcon Heavy payload had been announced. She said ""this is going to be so awesome"" and later added, ""oh this is legit and of course there will be cameras!""

Musk also initially confirmed his plans to The Verge on Friday, writing "" it's so real"" in email to the outlet. However, The Verge updated its story on Saturday, writing that, in a follow-up email, ""Musk told us he 'totally made it up.'""

Business Insider reached SpaceX, though the company declined to comment on the record. We also contacted Musk directly, but he did not immediately reply. NASA also did not immediately answer our questions about Musk's stated plan to launch a car to Mars orbit.

Despite the back-and-forth, the claim appears to be legitimate. Musk reportedly told Eric Berger, Ars Technica's senior space editor, that the mission was "" 100% real"" after The Verge's story was updated, and Berger later tweeted that two SpaceX officials had also confirmed his claim.

""The Roadster to Mars payload is real,"" the second SpaceX official reportedly told Berger.

Later on, Phil Plait, an astronomer and writer, reported new details from Musk at his blog, Bad Astronomy.

""No, it's not going to Mars. It's going near Mars,"" Plait wrote, specifically in what's called a Hohmann transfer orbit: an elliptical path that goes out to the orbit of Mars and back to Earth orbit on a near-endless loop (hence the ""billion years or so"" detail from Musk).

And apparently, Musk is also willing to consider launching other objects inside the Tesla suggested by the public.

""Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up,"" Musk reportedly told Plait in an email, ""so I wouldn't put anything of irreplaceable sentimental value on it.""

Musk revealed that the payload inside the rocket will be his own Tesla Roadster (in midnight cherry color, no less) which launch while playing Space Oddity by David Bowie.

The planned destination is Mars and, all being well, Musk said his personal vehicle will be in the planet’s orbit for “a billion years.”

Musk’s tweets appears in line with reports from earlier this week that the Falcon Heavy launch will take place in early 2018.

SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told Aviation Week that the company is planning a static test fire of its Falcon Heavy rocket, with all 27 Merlin engines used simultaneously, before the end of 2017. Should that proceed without any major issues, the full launch would happen weeks later.

The serial entrepreneurs latest venture, The Boring Company, is digging a tunnel in the SpaceX parking lot with the eventual goal of extending it to Los Angeles International Airport. The tunnel system would enable vehicles to travel via a futuristic car skate, which could reach up to 130 mph, underground, Musk has said.

Musk on Wednesday provided a first glimpse of the car skate in action. The skate will first transport cars underground before shooting them through the tunnel:

Here's how the skate would work once the cars are transported underground:

The skate could also transport pedestrians by carrying them on a minibus:

A minibus could help transport pedestrians who don't want to take a car through the tunnel. Boring company

The Boring Company was able to complete the first segment of the LA tunnel so quickly because it doesn't need permits to dig on SpaceX's property.

In fact, Musk has been working with Hawthorne city officials for over a year about building the tunnel, which was originally conceived as a way to get SpaceX employees across from the parking lot to the building safely.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has acknowledged that getting approval to extend the tunnel network beyond the SpaceX property line is more challenging.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, however, has said he is interested in using the tunnel to support a rail connection between LAX and Union Station, a main transit hub that connects Los Angeles to distant suburbs.

Hawthorne Mayor Alex Vargas on Friday visited The Boring Company's tunnel site.

The Boring Company is pursuing other tunneling projects outside of Los Angeles.

Musk said on Friday that he received "" verbal government approval"" on the federal level to build a tunnel between New York and Washington DC. The tunnel would support a Hyperloop, a high-speed transit system that's still in the early stages of testing.

New York and Philadelphia city officials say they have yet to speak with Musk or The Boring Company about the massive project.

Musk is also in "" preliminary talks"" with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel about digging a tunnel that would connect downtown Chicago with O'Hare International Airport.

Either way, Musk will need more than preliminary talks to commence any of these projects. The Boring Company will face the arduous task of securing city and state permits."

Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Elon Musk is far more than a technology or business superstar.

His fame is far-reaching, and his fortune is vast. His companies are captivating in ways that Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, Google, and Facebook aren't.

Musk has world-changing ambitions and an image that inspired the Tony Stark character from ""Iron Man.""

Which makes sense: Musk might not be an actual superhero, but he does his best to play one in real life.

Tesla isn't just the most successful electric-car company in history — it's the only new automaker to be established in the US since Chrysler in 1925. And SpaceX doesn't just want to send rockets into orbit — it wants to send astronauts to Mars.

In the case of Tesla, the markets have rewarded Musk's appetite for risk with a $30 billion market cap. The CEO could, if he were so inclined, sit back and congratulate himself for helming a company that was selling no cars just over a decade ago but is now aiming to sell 80,000 to 90,000 in 2016 and has provided early stock owners with a 1,000% return since the 2010 IPO.

But that isn't Musk's style. And while it's been good to be Elon for the past 10 years, he's now up against the biggest leadership challenges of his career, as he tries to push Tesla beyond being simply an electric-car company toward being a full-on provider of sustainable-energy and transportation solutions.

Steep learning curve

The biggest problem with that objective, of course, is that Tesla is still learning how to be a world-class carmaker. The bottom line is that it makes pretty great cars that hundred of thousands of potential customers are willing to wait years to acquire, in the case of the $35,000 mass-market Model 3, arriving in 2017, but it also struggles to make enough of them on time.

The Model S sedan has been in production for several years and is in enough demand that it should be helping Tesla meet its annual delivery targets.

But Tesla has, for two years now, fallen short on the upper end of its delivery guidance. The Model X SUV launched years behind schedule and was beset with design and engineering complexities that have limited production — and the ability of the Model X to contribute to Tesla's vast cash needs.

The Model 3 unveiling. YouTube/Tesla

The Model 3 is critical to Musk's goal of selling 500,000 vehicles annually by 2018, but production on that scale has forced Musk to rethink the whole process of industrial assembly, going so far as to propose that Tesla will introduce the most significant advancement in manufacturing since Henry Ford opened his legendary River Rouge plant in 1928 and Toyota developed is much-imitated Toyota Production System after World War II.

Elon's agony

""We were in production hell,"" Musk told analysts after the company reported second-quarter earnings in early August. He was referring to the extreme difficulties that Tesla had faced at its factory in Northern California through the first half of the year. It got so bad that Musk said he kept a sleeping bag in his office so that he could sleep near the assembly line. He said that this experience led to ""a whole lot of mental scar tissue.""

That doesn't sound very much like the life of a high-tech rock star, a man who has been compared to everyone from Steve Jobs and Thomas Edison to Howard Hughes and Walt Disney.

Can Iron Man make it? Flickr/jurvetson

But this is Musk's new normal. Wall Street has been turning more bearish on Tesla, at least in the short term. Reliable Tesla bulls have trimmed their expectations. The consensus is that Tesla is headed into a rough patch — and Musk's move to acquire struggling Solar City, founded by his cousins, and integrate it with Tesla energy business isn't helping matters.

The deal will add billions in debt to Tesla's balance sheet and stretch Musk even thinner as a leader. Obviously, having a SpaceX rocket explode on the launch pad, with a Facebook satellite on board, isn't helping matters.

The Tesla pattern

Musk may believe that the worst is over for Tesla, at least in terms of its production woes from earlier in the year, but if history provides any lessons, things are about to get a lot more difficult on the financial front.

Tesla stock suffers at the end of the year. Screenshot via Google Finance

Tesla lacks a major news event or product announcement to carry it through the fall. In 2014, it rolled out the all-wheel-drive version of the Model S, and last year it launched the Model X. This year, nothing has yet been announced. The last big story to come from Tesla was the opening of the massive Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada. Otherwise, the company has been dealing with investigations and the fallout from a fatal crash of a Model S in Florida in May, while the vehicle was using the Autopilot semi-self-driving technology.

At the end of the year, Tesla tends to endure a stock slide that lasts through the first quarter of the following year. And that slide may have started earlier this year, as shares are well off their 2016 highs, trading last week below $200.

There's not much point in underestimating Musk. He's seen Tesla past the verge of bankruptcy (in 2008) and has put more electric vehicles on the road than anyone thought possible back in 2010. His contributions to society have thus far been heroic. But he's going to have to call on all his reserves of innovation and inspiration to ride out the next six months."

The focus of Musk's new presentation, which updates a 2016 talk he gave at the International Astronautical Congress, was the "" Big F---ing Rocket,"" or BFR.

Musk told a crowd at the 2017 IAC meeting in Adelaide, Australia, that he hopes to start building the 35-story space vehicle in early 2018, launch the first BFR to Mars in 2022, and use it to land crewed missions on the red planet in 2024 (though he has yet to say how a Martian colony would survive).

In addition, Musk teased the use of the space vehicles as part of a high-speed transportation system around Earth.

After Musk's talk on September 28, a Reddit user transcribed the full 42-minute-long presentation, and SpaceX published a high-resolution version of Musk's slides to its Mars website last week, a company spokesperson confirmed with Business Insider.

We've edited and appended the new transcript and slides here to reproduce Musk's detailed presentation in full. If you're ready to learn a thing or two about rocket science from a tech mogul, keep scrolling."

Elon Musk has become one of the world's most ambitious and successful leaders by building tools of the future. He made his first fortune founding, and then selling, the company that would become PayPal; his current endeavors include electric car company Tesla as well as SpaceX, which he hopes will one day get him to Mars.

But Musk didn't get there all by himself. ""I read books,"" he has replied when asked how he learned to build rockets, according to an Esquire profile. Indeed, the billionaire has long looked up to heroes in different fields for inspiration.

He's not alone: A survey of 233 wealthy individuals found that the vast majority (88%) said they devote 30 minutes or more each day to reading. And many, like Musk, tend to prefer nonfiction.

Musk isn't shy about sharing his favorite books and explaining the ways they shaped him. And for a glimpse into how he's thinking about the future, here are 5 books that he has recommended to explain where we're headed."

The first run of 1,000 Roadsters will cost $250,000 each. ""The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,"" Musk said.

Elon Musk is the ultimate performer. And he knows it. His latest bit of intrigue? Sunday night, the billionaire teased the notion that the only thing stopping Tesla's most souped up Tesla Roadster from flying is safety precautions.

And then, as if to put a cherry on top, Musk tweeted that the model that goes from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 1.9 seconds is the ""base model"" and ""there will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.""

The car will ""maybe"" be able to fly ""short hops,"" he said.

""Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe …

""Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities.""

Though admittedly a bit Jetson-esque, tech titan Musk is also CEO of SpaceX, affording Tesla the knowledge and access to rocket technology.

Still, Musk has also said the notion of a flying car has some practical challenges.

""I'm in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias against flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generated will be very high. Let's just say that if something's flying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation,"" Musk said in an April 2017 TED Talk.

""You don't think to yourself, 'Well, I feel better about today.' You're thinking, 'Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off and guillotine me?' Things like that,"" said Musk."

People will go to Mars by 2025. “If things go according to plan, we should be able to launch people probably in 2024 with arrival in 2025,” said Musk. When asked about how he views establishing law and government on Mars, Musk said he believes a direct democracy would work most efficiently. “I think that’s better because the potential for corruption is substantially diminished in a direct versus representative democracy.”

Musk has heavily considered the possibility that we may very well be living in a simulation. His main argument to support this is the rapid advancement of the technology that powers video games, which he believes will one day become so realistic they will be impossible to distinguish from real life. “Forty years ago, we had pong,” he said. “Now forty years later, we have photorealistic, 3-D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year . . . If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality.”

Companies like Google, Uber, and Ford are already experimenting with self-driving car technology. While many of these advancements are in their early stages, Musk believes automobiles will be completely autonomous in two years. “I consider autonomous driving to be a basically solved problem,” he said. “We’re less than two years away from complete autonomy. Regulators however will take at least another year; they’ll want to see billions of miles of data.”

When answering a question about how to avoid a doomsday-like scenario, he offered another bold stance: humans are already cyborgs. Musk pointed to our social media personalities and reliance on computers to perform everyday tasks and communicate. “You have basically superpowers with your computer and your phone and the applications that are there,” he said. “You have more power than the president of the United States had 20 years ago.”

Elon Musk offers free repair to German 'hero'

Tesla chief Elon Musk is offering free repairs to a man who sacrificed his Tesla car to save an unconscious driver near Munich, Germany.

According to local media and the car blog Jalopnik, while driving in his Tesla Model S, Manfred Kick noticed another car swerving towards the traffic barrier with the driver looking unconscious behind the wheel.

He pulled in front of the Volkswagen Passat and applied his brakes, managing to stop both vehicles. Both cars were damaged in the incident, but Mr Kick may have saved the unconscious driver's life.

Moved by the report, Mr Musk made the German Tesla owner an offer he could not refuse.

And social media users are just as impressed.

""Anyone who puts their $70,000+ car on the line to keep a total stranger safe is a bit of a stud in my book,"" tweeted a user at Mr Musk.

But some have been so inspired by Mr Kick's bravery that they are demanding even more.

""Well done to the Mr Tesla Hero. Now, can he save the rest of us and the world?"" asked another user.

We're still waiting for his response to that one.

'LOL' shirt up for grabs in China

While Malaysian authorities are investigating the death of Kim Jong-nam, the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a T-shirt similar to the one worn by a woman being touted as a suspect was reportedly available for 6,324 yuan (£738; $922) on Taobao, one of China's largest online shopping platforms.

It is believed Kim died after being attacked with some form of chemical by two women at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

The grainy CCTV image of a woman wearing a T-shirt with the letters ""LOL"" printed on the front was first broadcast in South Korea and Malaysia and has since been widely shared by media sources around the world.

Although Malaysian police have confirmed the arrest of two female suspects, it is not clear the woman in the white top is one of them.

Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reports the top appeared on Taobao as the ""same T-shirt worn by North Korean female spy"", and was subsequently taken down after being recirculated on the internet.

Apple Daily published a photo of the offer, which was apparently accompanied by the same grainy image. No photo or details about the actual T-shirt can be seen in the advert, but we do know it was being offered in different sizes.

Chinese social media users were speculating later on the micro-blogging service Sina Weibo if the listing was genuine or an attempt by an individual to cash in on a major news story.

Breakup video triggers 'overwhelming' response

A video of a woman attempting to find out why her ex-boyfriend cheated on her multiple times has gone viral on social media, generating thousands of posts and memes.

The six-minute video features Kourtney and Leonard sat in front of each other discussing their breakup.

Leonard tells Kourtney that he had lost count of the number times he was involved in affairs. Shocked by the revelation, Kourtney walks out of the discussion halfway through before returning to ask more questions.

The video has since been retweeted 145,000 times. #HurtBae began trending soon afterwards, and has so far been used over 350,000 times on social media platforms.

Many users offered their support to Kourtney, who can be seen shedding tears at the end of the clip.

""#HurtBae is a lesson. If you are not serious don't get started. Don't awaken a woman's heart if you have no intentions to love her right,"" was one user's take.

Another user said Kourtney's experience is ""a reality for many"".

The sheer number of posts drove Kourtney to thank people on Instagram for what she described as an ""overwhelming"" response."

To keep those goals on track, Elon Musk has to hire some of the most talented people around.

The entrepreneur has developed some pretty distinct hiring practices over the years. Even if your company 's objective isn't to populate another planet, you can channel his tactics for finding the best candidates. Here's how.

1. Interview everyone yourself.

SpaceX is now a 5,000-person company, which would make personally screening every candidate nearly impossible, but Musk interviewed every candidate himself until fairly recently. Generally, the best candidates get a call with a team manager, and then the best of the best must pass through Musk himself. ""That's a lot of interviews,"" he has said.

2. Ask them about a problem they solved.

In interviews, Musk asks candidates specific questions about the problems they solved in previous roles to determine whether they were actually the one who found the solution, as opposed to merely being a member of the team that did so. ""If someone was really the person who solved it,"" Musk said, ""they'll be able to answer on multiple levels. They'll be able to get down to the brass tacks. And, if they weren't, they'll get stuck. And then you can say, 'Oh, this person was not really the person who solved it.' Because anyone who struggled hard with a problem never forgets it.""

3. Make them solve problems in the interview.

Candidates on Glassdoor have reported being asked engineering and physics riddles in their interviews. Here's one: You're sitting in a canoe floating in a pool with a brick in your lap. You drop the brick overboard. What happens to the pool's water level? Answer: It falls, since the brick was displacing the amount of water equal to its weight while it was in the boat; now it's displacing an amount of water equal to its volume. (Engineers are smart.)

That said, the questions should be relevant to the skills they'll need on the job. ""I'm not necessarily looking for someone who has brilliant analytical ability if their job is going to be assembling hardware,"" Musk said.

4. Don't worry about degrees.

Musk doesn't require his candidates to have college degrees--or even high school diplomas. His thinking: Some of the world's best innovators have accomplished great things without graduating. Musk has pointed out that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Google co-founder Larry Page all lack college degrees. ""If you had a chance to hire them,"" he has said, ""of course, that'd be a good idea.""

5. Don't settle for anything less than the best candidate.

That goes for any position, from top managers on down. Former SpaceX talent director Dolly Singh said that Musk used to tell her to find the single best person on the planet for any given job, no matter the role. When SpaceX built a yogurt stand in its headquarters, Musk instructed her, ""Go to Pinkberry and find me the employee of the month.""

6. Seek the right mindset.

Being exceptionally talented is important, but Musk also looks for candidates with a positive attitude. He also considers whether co-workers would like working with them--what he refers to as a strict ""no-assholes policy."""

Amber Heard, 30, was recently spotted at the same Miami Hotel as billionaire Elon Musk, 45, and while speculation arose that the two might be a new couple, a source tells PEOPLE they are “just friends and have been for a few years.”

Besides sharing the same taste in hotels, the two are also each going through a divorce. Musk recently split from his wife, actress Talulah Riley, while Heard is famously in the midst of a contentious break up with Johnny Depp.

So just who is Heard’s billionaire buddy? Read on to learn more about the tech guru who inspired a famous movie character.

1. He has an estimated net worth of $12.5 billion.

According to Forbes, Musk is number 94 on the list of world billionaires and 37 in the U.S. as of July 22. His fortune is largely self-made through the companies he has founded and runs.

2. He’s in the midst of his second divorce from his second wife.

Musk married Riley for the first time in 2010 shortly after divorcing his first wife, Justine. The couple was married for two years before divorcing in 2012.

But the separation didn’t last long and they married again in July of 2013. But this was short-lived as Musk filed for a second divorce on New Year’s Eve in 2014 before withdrawing the request. Finally, the actress filed one last time in March of this year to end things.

3. He is best known for founding Tesla Motors and SpaceX.

In 2002, Musk started SpaceX in his desire to launch a project that sent an experimental greenhouse to Mars. In 2012, the company launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. Musk is also the man behind Tesla Motors, the car company that designs, manufactures, and sells electric cars.

4. After a heartbreaking tragedy, he became the father of five sons.

Musk’s first son with Justine died tragically of SIDS at 10-weeks-old in 2002. According to a letter Justine wrote for Marie Claire, “Nevada went down for a nap, placed on his back as always, and stopped breathing,” she writes. “By the time the paramedics resuscitated him, he had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead. He spent three days on life support in a hospital in Orange County before we made the decision to take him off it.”

The couple then went on to have five more sons through IVF treatment, a set of twins and a set of triplets. Justine reveals in the letter that she is now estranged from Musk and share custody of children.

5. Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man character is loosely based on him.

Writing for 2010’s Time 100 Most Influential list, the film’s director, Jon Favreau, talked about how Tony Stark borrows from Musk and his life. Downey himself suggested Favreau talk to Musk to help develop the Stark character.

“Downey was right,” Favreau concedes in the dedication. “Elon is a paragon of enthusiasm, good humor and curiosity a Renaissance man in an era that needs them.”"

There is ""way too much hype"" around Tesla, says Wozniak, speaking to CNBC's Deirdre Bosa at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas on Sunday. ""And if [Tesla says] something is going to happen, don't quite count on it,"" says Wozniak. Wozniak says Tesla's promotions about its cars' self-driving capabilities are overblown and lead people to trust the ""autopilot"" feature more than they should. ""Tesla has in people's mind that they have cars that will just drive themselves totally, and it is so far from the truth, so they have deceived us,"" says Wozniak. In October of 2016, Musk announced all Teslas would be produced with the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability and released a video promoting a ""summon"" feature, allowing owners to call their Teslas with a tap on a smartphone, ""even if you are on the other side of the country."" Again, just this week, Musk tweeted about how the Tesla will know where you want to go without you having to tell it.

In a lot of ways, Tesla is behind companies like Volvo and Audi. Steve Wozniak co-founder of Apple

A 2017 Wall Street Journal investigation revealed the autonomous push from Musk has caused conflict in the ranks of Tesla's engineers. When Musk made the announcement that all Teslas would be equipped with the technology to be fully autonomous, Tesla engineers felt they didn't yet have a product that would safely do that, the Wall Street Journal reported. No Tesla is fully self-driving, or autonomous, and autopilot still requires drivers to be active and pay attention to the road. According to the company's website, Tesla's autopilot feature is able to do things like match speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, change lanes without driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway, park itself and be summoned to and from your garage. But the misconception of the self-driving ability of Tesla vehicles can be hazardous, Wozniak says. ""Sometimes Teslas are dangerous because of what they call 'autopilot,'"" says Wozniak. ""You get thinking, 'Oh, it is easy, I can reach over and not look for a few seconds,' and that is the second your car drifts over the line,"" he says, adding that it is ""easy to make mistakes, especially certain weather conditions and whatnot.""

Elon Musk has said again that artificial intelligence could be humanity’s greatest existential threat, this time by starting a third world war.

The prospect clearly weighs heavily on Musk’s mind, since the SpaceX, Tesla and Boring Company chief tweeted at 2.33am Los Angeles time about how AI could led to the end of the world – without the need for the singularity.

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.

His fears were prompted by a statement from Vladimir Putin that “artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind … It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.”

Hashing out his thoughts in public, Musk clarified that he was not just concerned about the prospect of a world leader starting the war, but also of an overcautious AI deciding “that a [pre-emptive] strike is [the] most probable path to victory”.

He’s less worried about North Korea’s increasingly bold nuclear ambitions, arguing that the result for Pyongyang if they launched a nuclear missile “would be suicide” – and that it doesn’t have any entanglements that would lead to a world war even if it did. His view is that AI is “vastly more risky” than the Kim Jong-un-led country.

Musk’s fear of AI warfare has been a driving force in his public statements for a long time. Last month, he was one of more than 100 signatories calling for a UN-led ban of lethal autonomous weapons.

“Once developed, lethal autonomous weapons will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend,” the letter read. “These can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways.

“We do not have long to act. Once this Pandora’s box is opened, it will be hard to close.”"

The United States is generally considered to be the nation leading the charge towards AI currently, with tech giants like Google and Microsoft pouring large amounts of cash into research and development projects.

CLOSE Elon Musk says global race for artificial intelligence will cause World War III. Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60

A race toward ""superiority"" between countries over artificial intelligence will be the most likely cause of World War III, warns entrepreneur Elon Musk.

The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has been outspoken about his fears of AI, urging countries to consider regulations now before the technology becomes more widely used.

The comments were sparked by comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said the country leading the way in AI ""will become ruler of the world,"" reports news site RT.

""It begins,"" said Musk in an earlier tweet ahead of his warning about the potential risks.

""China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science,"" Musk wrote in a tweet posted Monday. ""Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.""

China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 4, 2017

In response to a Twitter user, Musk notes the AI itself — not a country's leader — could spark a major conflict ""if it decides that a preemptive strike is most probable path to victory.""

May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 4, 2017

Musk has emerged as a critic of AI safety, seeking ways for governments to regulate the technology before it gets out of control. Last month, Musk warned fears over the security of AI are more risky than the threat of nuclear war from North Korea.

In July, during the National Governors Association meeting, Musk pushed states to consider new rules for AI.

""AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation than reactive,"" said Musk.

You can use the same approach. Asking the right questions is a skill that can be learned, according to Warren Berger, bestselling author of A More Beautiful Question.

Berger says when he mentors that, ""Oftentimes there may not be a right question. You know you're asking a good question when you get sort of a rise out of people. That's a good starting point."" Then, he says, getting your question in the world for feedback is the next step. The results of gaining feedback on the question, possibly through a demo or other minimum viable product, will help you understand if the question is 'the right question'--or not.

Musk's process for asking the right question

Musk recalls that his first questions as a founder were pretty mundane, like, how can I make enough money to live and still have time for games and computers? His first few companies, like Zip2 and X.com, were designed to make money. As he got more money, he got frustrated with how money was transferred, and that led to PayPal. Today, the market cap of Tesla is around $40 billion and SpaceX is estimated at $15 billion. As Musk's founder questions have gotten better, his companies have gotten bigger. ""To the degree we better understand the universe, then we know which questions to ask,"" he says.

How the right question led to SpaceX

Although we think of SpaceX as a bold success in process, it actually started from failure of another of Musk's questions. He believed we could colonize Mars if we solved the food-away-from-Earth problem. He figured Martian greenhouses were the answer. ""I spent several hundred thousand dollars just getting the design worked out and engaging companies . . . and then it came to buying the rocket."" What he learned was, rockets were a few million dollars--each. Musk said at that rate, he didn't have the budget for the greenhouse project. ""At that rocket price, the math just wasn't working.""

So Musk asked another question--why are rockets so expensive? ""I came to the conclusion that there was really no good reason for rockets to cost so much, and they could be less . . . a lot less. If one could make them reusable, like planes, the cost of space travel would drop dramatically. The cost of the fuel was .2 to .5 percent of the cost of the rocket, kind of like the plane."" In fact, ""Nobody had been able to make a reasonable rocket work--and I thought, if we can do that, that would be a breakthrough for space travel."" SpaceX was born.

Like with SpaceX, the right question focuses you on the right problem--which is often a key choke point in your industry

Musk used creative questions to spark the company that became SolarCity (now Tesla Energy), too. He says, ""People weren't focusing on the right problem. People were focusing on the panel. It's a problem--but it's not the most important problem . . . the thorny problem is, how to get solar on the tops of millions of buildings?"" Solar roof tiles are his latest answer--not a panel in sight.

How to ask your own creative questions

Joi Ito, head of MIT Media Lab, entrepreneur, investor, and board member at the The New York Times and at Sony, has studied innovation for decades. He's a big fan of asking critical creative questions as a founder, because he says the model of how the human race learns is changing. ""It's a time of exponential change, so things are different every day. The old model of learning--that you do a lot of it when you're young and then become an adult who doesn't learn as much--that just doesn't work as a productive way of living now. You have to learn new things all the time. And you learn by being curious and by questioning."""

It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017

You may not think this tweet is special. Just good PR, right?

Wrong.

-- ADVERTISEMENT --

Think about it: How many times have you had a silent moment of appreciation for your colleagues or customers?

Now, did you take the time to share those feelings by writing a short note? Or giving them a call? Or sending a tweet? (Come on, it's 2017.)

All too often, we neglect to show--or sometimes even feel--appreciation for the people who have helped us succeed.

Decades ago, Dale Carnegie highlighted the power of showing appreciation in his classic How to Win Friends and Influence People:

There is one longing--almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep--which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls ""the desire to be great."" It is what Dewy calls the ""desire to be important."" ... William James said: ""The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated."" He didn't speak, mind you, of the ""wish"" or the ""desire"" or the ""longing"" to be appreciated. He said the ""craving"" to be appreciated.

We all have people who have helped us along our path. When you take time to thank those people, you satisfy a basic human craving and strengthen your relationship.

Not to mention that it makes you feel pretty good, too.

So, how can you take advantage of opportunities to show appreciation to others?

Here are four, simple steps that will help.

1. Reflect

Sometimes it feels like the world is moving at breakneck speed, and you're struggling just to keep up.

Bet Musk feels that way sometimes, too.

But we all have the same amount of time in the day. The key is to identify your priorities: Nothing wrong with checking your social media feeds in the morning, but why not first spend 15 minutes reflecting: on your values, goals, and, yes, even your accomplishments--and strive to remember those who have helped you along the way?

2. Keep it real

This isn't just a single message from Tesla's famous CEO; it's a piece of a much bigger picture. Over the years, Musk has demonstrated through both words and actions that he appreciates Tesla's customers.

All of this adds power and believability to that emotional appeal at the end of his tweet:

""We won't forget.""

Appreciation only works if it's genuine. Empty flattery or token appreciation will backfire because people detect insincerity from a mile away.

If you struggle to show sincere appreciation, work first to cultivate an attitude of gratitude. Train yourself to be appreciative, by looking for the good and positive things in others. The smiling, kind barista isn't just doing her job; she's making your day a little bit better. The people cleaning your office aren't just making a buck; they're doing you a huge service.

By learning to show appreciation for the little things, you'll naturally do so for the greater things, too.

3. Be specific

Musk's message is short and sweet.

Three sentences. Less than 30 words.

But in one sentence in particular, Musk tells us why he appreciates Tesla customers:

""It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company.""

For those who know the history of Tesla, it's a story of David versus Goliath. (Musk himself told it recently on ... what else? Twitter.) Those who took a risk on what was once a fledgling company now own a car produced by America's most valuable automaker--who just happens to be disrupting the entire auto industry.

Lesson: Don't just tell people that you appreciate them. Tell them what you appreciate and why.

4. Show appreciation as soon as possible

So often I've told myself that I want to say thank you to someone, and then I get caught up in something and forget.

Maybe it's true that ""late is better than never,"" but never is certainly the worst-case scenario.

Take advantage of the moment to show appreciation as soon as possible, and you'll build stronger, better relationships with the people around you--and you'll feel better about yourself, too.

So, come on, what are you waiting for:"

Musk joined the president’s advisory councils a month after the election last year, along with a band of high-profile tech executives. Trump’s election seemed like it could hurt those in the renewable-energy business, and Musk seemed to hop on board in part to get the president’s ear. It also helped that Trump supported partnerships between NASA and private spaceflight company’s like Musk’s SpaceX. The partnership seemed shaky from the beginning, with Musk criticizing Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations.

On Wednesday, as rumors of the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord swirled, Musk said he was leaving the advisory councils over the move.

The billionaire co-founder of PayPal (pypl) and CEO of Tesla (tsla) and SpaceX has often aired his misgivings about the technological advancement. He’s even backed a non-profit research organization, Open AI, that aims to ensure the tech is developed ethically and safely.

Now, in a video teaser shared exclusively with Fortune, Musk clarifies what he deems is the “biggest risk” that AI poses to humanity. The clip is a short segment from Lo and Behold, the latest film by German filmmaker Werner Herzog, due out this week. In it, Musk conjures a dystopian future usurped by profit-seeking AI warmongers.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

“I think that the biggest risk is not that the AI will develop a will of its own,” Musk says, clarifying his unease, “but rather that it will follow the will of people that establish its utility function.”

“If it is not well thought out—even if its intent is benign—it could have quite a bad outcome,” he continues, going on to provide a hypothetical doomsday scenario in which robo-investors incite war. “If you were a hedge fund or private equity fund and you said, ‘Well, all I want my AI to do is maximize the value of my portfolio,’ then the AI could decide, well, the best way to do that is to short consumer stocks, go long defense stocks, and start a war.”

“That would obviously be quite bad,” Musk says, lowering his eyes, dispassionately.

The scene cuts to shadowy room in which a statue of a Cylon, a genocidal cybernetic race in the apocalyptic sci-fi television show Battlestar Galactica, looms. Herzog’s distinctive drawl remarks:”Such an attack would be much more prosaic than an invasion of these aliens in the SpaceX reception area.”

In past interviews, Musk has hinted that a certain company’s approach to AI worries him. With a wink and a nod, you might recognize Google, rather than Facebook (fb), as his prime motivator for advocating caution, as The Verge has noted.

Meanwhile, Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet (goog) and an advisor to the Pentagon, has dismissed people’s fears about the tech and embraced it more openly. Schmidt has said that he believes AI has great defensive potential, though he has concerns about it falling into the hands of dictators and authoritarian regimes.

Meanwhile, other interested parties have told people that AI will do more good than harm. A research scientist at IBM (ibm) told Fortune’s sister magazine Time earlier this year that he believes Musk and Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking’s fears about AI are “overblown.”

On Monday, The Verge tweeted a link to their story headlined ‘The world’s first crewless ship will launch next year’, to which the SpaceX founder replied “Umm …” with a picture the crewless ship that he launched called Of Course I Still Love You.

The Verge article, with information originally reported in The Wall Street Journal, claims that a Norwegian boat named Yara Birkeland will be launched in 2018 and be fully autonomous by 2020. They say it will use GPS, radar, cameras and sensors to navigate around other ships and dock on its own.

But Musk’s SpaceX has already developed three autonomous ships on which to land its Falcon 9 reusable rocket, according to Foxtrot Alpha. The website reports that these landing ships use GPS to position themselves for the rocket, but can be manoeuvred by remote control.

The last time that Musk’s drone ship successfully landed a rocket was on June 25th when SpaceX landed two Falcon 9 rockets back on Earth in the space of 48 hours, according to The Verge. One of the rockets landed on a drone ship called Just Read the Instructions that was floating in the Pacific Ocean. It was the eighth time that SpaceX has successfully used the autonomous ship."

To some, it may seem like Elon Musk and Tesla arrived out of thin air, but nothing could be further from the truth. Tesla's 15-year history was full dramatic of twists and turns.

Tesla was originally conceived in 2003 by Silicon Valley engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2004, Musk led a $7.5 million Series A funding round and became the controlling investor and chairman of the company's board of directors.

In 2007, Tesla faltered. After three CEOs failed to last more than a year at the car company, Musk stepped up to take over the role in 2008. ""It just made sense for me to have both hands on the wheel,"" he said at the time.

In response to Musk’s tweet that the $1 billion figure cited in the USA Today tweet was too low, Daimler said that the Tesla CEO was “absolutely right” and then pointed out that it’s actually investing over $10 billion, including its next generation EV spend on top of its $1 billion investment in battery production alone.

Musk didn’t actually prompt any change in Daimler’s plans (or not in this tweet anyway – Tesla as a company has had an impact on the EV industry at large that’s hard to quantify). Instead, Musk was guilty of that cardinal Twitter sin: Not clicking through and assuming the whole story is the headline or 140 character summary. Jalopnik’s Dean Kawamura pointed this out, but Musk’s cheeky answer could either be a straight up joke, or a reference to the fact that Tesla has changed the game for EVs.

Musk announced the news in a Twitter post shortly after the president’s statement at the White House.

“[I] Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk wrote. He had previously been a member of Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative and the Strategic and Policy Forum.

As early as last week Musk had stated that he was “cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.” But yesterday, as rumors swirled that Trump would begin the process of withdrawing the US from the agreement, Musk threatened to sever his connection to the president. “[I] don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain,” he tweeted.

This prompted another Twitter user to ask him what he’d do if Trump pulled the US out of the accord. Musk responded that he’d “have no choice but to depart councils in that case.”

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017

Musk had spent months swatting criticism for keeping his connection with Trump, especially because his companies — Tesla and SpaceX — benefit from government tax credits and contracts. He first explained the decision in February at the height of the controversy surrounding Trump’s proposed travel ban.

“My goals are to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all,” he wrote at the time. Musk then claimed that maintaining a relationship with the president would allow him to engage Trump on issues like climate change, which would “on balance serve the greater good.”

Later that week, he wrote that he had used one of the council meetings to raise climate change as an important issue. “I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong,” he added."

If it were anyone else, the notion of digging hundreds of miles of tunnels to create a new subterranean transportation network under congested cities would seem like pure science fiction.

But the dreamer behind this vision is Elon Musk, the billionaire innovator who has already shown with his Tesla electric cars and SpaceX rockets that he thinks big and doesn't wait for others to transform fantasy into reality.

Once again, Musk is aiming to shake up an arcane industry not used to outside-the-box thinking and yet potentially ripe for disruption: the underground world of tunneling.

He could use tunneling to achieve his moonshot goal of clearing up Los Angeles traffic. It also could be employed to build a “hyperloop” system — a passenger capsule that magnetically levitates inside a tube to achieve high speeds — that would run 226 miles from New York to Washington, D.C. Travel time: 29 minutes.

Musk hopes to dramatically speed up digging by inventing new tunnel-boring-machine technology that could slash billions from a major project.

Tunneling is big business. In the U.S. and Canada alone, there are about 60 major tunnel projects in the planning or design phase totaling more than 1.8 million feet, according to the Underground Construction Association of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration.

Although mass-transit proponents, tunnel machine companies and industry experts say the hurdles are enormous, Musk is bringing together the people and machinery to make his vision a reality.

The problem: Using existing technology, digging a tunnel from New York to D.C. could take nearly 100 years.

It seems like a challenge tailor-made for Musk who, having moved heavens with his space business, now seeks to move earth.

CLOSE Billionaire Elon Musk announced on twitter his latest project to dig holes through the ground in order to avoid traffic. USA TODAY

""Building a tunnel boring machine is as complicated as building a rocket,"" said Gary Brierley, a tunneling consultant and former president of the American Underground Construction Association whose professional nickname is Doctor Mole. ""I hate to say this, but I think rockets are kind of easy compared to tunnels.""

Brierley's logic? Rockets fly through the air and space, which is fairly predictable in composition. But digging tunnels requires navigating unforeseen rocks, soil, water, contamination and man-made objects. Musk will also need to figure out how to make sure nearby structural foundations are not disturbed.

To get started, Musk has assembled a stealth team of advisers to form The Boring Company and acquired a 14-foot-diameter tunnel machine from Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Super Excavators, USA TODAY learned. He is using the machine to start digging a pilot hole next to SpaceX’s factory in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, Calif.

The race between Gary, our pet snail who lives in a pineapple, and Godot, our tunnel boring machine, begins soon! A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on May 12, 2017 at 5:43am PDT

For now, The Boring Co. is staying quiet about its plans. It declined to comment for this story. But its challenge is clear.

Today's best machines can dig at a rate of about 1/10th of a mile per week, up from a few feet per day several decades ago, said Mike Mooney, director of the Center for Underground Tunneling and SmartGeo at the Colorado School of Mines. But many machines are slower.

For example, Washington, D.C.'s water system bought tunnel-boring machines — nicknamed Lady Bird, Nannie and Lucy — that ranged in speed from 18 feet per day to 57 feet per day for a recent phase of a project aimed at curbing sewer runoff into local waterways. At nearly 4.6 miles, the longest tunnel took about two years.

But Musk is aiming for a more than 10-fold improvement. Current machines, which often cost tens of millions, top out at a few hundred feet per day, but Mooney speculated that a mile per week is possible. At that rate, the hyperloop tunnel would take just over four years to dig.

Speeding up to that pace would dramatically reduce the billions in cost in tunneling, making Musk's hoped-for hyperloop project more realistic.

Industry leaders said there's room for innovation, particularly if Musk can develop a machine that tunnels through the earth while building retaining walls at the same time, a feat that most tunnel boring machines cannot accomplish today.

""That would be a pretty cool innovation,"" said Carlton Ray, director of the D.C. Water system's Clean Rivers Project.

Critics say Musk should focus on improving the transportation systems that are already in place — and in need of improvement — just as he has tackled creating a mass-market electric car with self-driving capability for Tesla.

Musk's plan is a ""distraction"" from the substantive issues at hand involving roads and railways, said Robert Puentes CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation.

Obstacles

Musk faces a raft of obstacles:

• Costs. Underground infrastructure is typically many times more expensive than above-ground infrastructure, which is why most parking garages are above ground and most passageways across rivers are bridges, not tunnels.

In addition to the cost of digging, tunnel contractors must build escape routes, prevent local structures from moving during digging and avoid triggering environmental problems.

• Bureaucracy. Tunnel companies say securing the necessary approvals from transportation agencies, environmental regulators and property owners can take longer than actually digging the tunnel.

""These tunnels are phenomenally expensive. The planning effort is phenomenally complex. Getting the permission is phenomenally complex,"" Brierley said.

Musk flummoxed the industry by tweeting in July that he had received ""verbal"" government approval for the hyperloop, without providing any details on what he meant. A White House spokesman said the Trump administration had had encouraging talks with Musk and The Boring Co. about the project.

What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2017

•Technology. Boring through the earth faster requires finding a way to build retaining walls simultaneously. In most projects today, tunnel boring machines remove about five or six feet of earth before it must stop temporarily to build a retaining wall, Mooney said.

""It burrows through the ground, ingesting the material like an earthworm essentially does,"" Mooney said. ""As it moves through the ground it then installs concrete rings behind it, to the rear end of the tunnel boring machine, and then pushes off that ring.""

Boring and wall building simultaneously has been done in only a few instances throughout the world in soft-ground tunneling, experts said. For example, German tunnel boring machine maker Herrenknecht said it had done it in a project in the Netherlands in the late 1990s.

•Logistics. After a tunnel boring machine's steel cutter-head tears through the earth, workers must remove displaced soil, which requires extensive coordination and a system of conveyors or muck cars, which look like garbage dumps on a rail.

For a project the size of the NYC-to-D.C. hyperloop, simply extracting the dirt alone would be vexing.

""You’ll need to figure out how to get rid of the muck,"" said D.C. Water’s Ray.

But The Boring Co. believes the dirt excavation process can be transformed.

The company says on its website that it is ""investigating technologies that will recycle the earth into useful bricks to be used to build structures.""

•Geology. The earth, quite simply, is not predictable. Soil composition changes and crews often encounter unexpected things underground.

For example, an 8,000-ton machine nicknamed Bertha snagged on an unexpected piece of steel in December 2013 while boring a nearly 2-mile highway tunnel underneath downtown Seattle. The pipe casing, measuring 8 inches in diameter and 110 feet long, had apparently been installed in 2002 after an earthquake to gauge groundwater flow.

Work stopped for about two years while the steel was removed and the machine was rehabilitated.

""One of the clear things we know about tunneling is we’re going through geology that’s constantly changing, and the ground you tunnel through plays a big role in how fast you can go,” Mooney said.

The future

Musk’s vision came about after he was overwhelmed with frustration at traffic and tweeted a vision of digging a network of tunnels underneath Los Angeles last December. It would whisk cars from place to place at high-speeds while riding atop platforms.

Soon after that, he pitched the underground tunnel in the Northeast as a way to commercialize his previously laid-out vision for the hyperloop. Such far-fetched ideas are easily dismissed from others. Because of his track record, Musk is taken seriously.

Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 17, 2016

""If his dreams are realized, we believe it could bring about dramatic social and economic changes,” said Takashi Hayato, president of the U.S. subsidiary of Japan-based manufacturer Hitachi Zosen, which made Seattle’s Bertha.

Andreas Nordbrandt, president of Swedish manufacturer Atlas Copco's Underground Rock Excavation division, which makes devices that drill tunnels by blasting through rock, said the industry must remain “humble” and not dismiss Musk’s ambitions.

He's ""maybe not 100% right, but at least on the right track,"" Nordbrandt said.

Musk's tweets came hours after an A.I. system developed by OpenAI defeated some of the world's best players at a military strategy game called Dota 2. According to a blog post by OpenAI, successfully playing the game involves predicting how an opponent will move, improvising in unfamiliar scenarios, and convincing the opponent's allies to help you instead.

OpenAI is the nonprofit artificial intelligence company Musk co-founded along with Peter Thiel and Sam Altman. The company's purpose is to research and develop A.I. and develop best practices to help ensure that the technology is used for good.

Musk has in the past called A.I. humanity's ""biggest existential threat."" A known A.I. fear monger, he recently got in a brief public spat with Mark Zuckerberg about the danger that the technology poses to humans. Zuckerberg, whose Facebook--like Tesla--invests heavily in artificial intelligence, referred to Musk's prophesizing about doomsday scenarios as ""irresponsible."" Musk responded on Twitter the next day by calling Zuckerberg's understanding of the topic ""limited.""

Comparing the threat of A.I. to that of nuclear war with North Korea is clearly a tactic meant to shock, as Musk has been wont to do on this topic. Earlier this year, he laid out a scenario in which A.I. systems meant to farm strawberries could lead to the destruction of mankind.

Even if Musk is speaking in hyperbole, though, it's not hard to see why an A.I. system that outsmarts humans at military strategy might be cause for concern.

Musk's opinions on the technology have been at odds with those of tech leaders like Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. All have advocated for A.I. in recent years with few, if any, reservations.

While Tesla relies heavily on artificial intelligence in developing self-driving cars, Musk's opinions have been at odds with those of his fellow tech titans. In July, Musk told a group at the National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island that he believes A.I. should be regulated proactively, before the need for such limitations even arise."

But the business magnate didn't create these innovative companies alone. With an estimated 4,000 employees at SpaceX and around 30,000 employees at Tesla, Musk's No. 1 tip for young leaders makes sense: ""Hire great people."" Hiring talented individuals, he tells company review site Glassdoor, is ""90 percent of the solution as hiring wrong can cost you so much."" He's right: Financially, it takes an average of 52 days to fill an open position, up from 48 days in 2011, according to research compiled by Glassdoor. Additionally, U.S. companies spend $4,000 on average to fill each vacant position.

Leaders should interview potential hires

Musk has a solution to filling open roles with the best employees: He sometimes conducts interviews himself. In 2015, he tweeted that he was looking for ""hardcore"" software engineers, who he would personally interview. When speaking with job candidates, Musk asks questions about problems they have solved in previous roles. The entrepreneur specifically wants to determine if the candidate solved the issue single-handedly or as part of a team. ""People who really solved the problem, they know exactly how they solved it; they know the little details,"" Musk says.

Great hires help companies reach goals"

November 27, 2017 2 min read

One of the key mysteries of Bitcoin -- which recently reached a jaw-dropping value of more than $9,000 -- is who exactly created the cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto is listed as the author of the original paper describing Bitcoin, but no actual person, or group, has come out to say they are Nakamoto.

Well, hold onto your hats, because Sahil Gupta, who says he was a software engineering intern at SpaceX, recently wrote a Medium post making a case that Satoshi Nakamoto is none other than Elon Musk.

Related: 11 Things You Need to Know About Bitcoin

What's Gupta's evidence for this claim? Nothing concrete, but his logic is relatively sound. The original 2008 Bitcoin paper was written by someone ""with a deep understanding of economics and cryptography,"" which Gupta says Musk possesses. Musk is also a master of coding language C++, the language Bitcoin was written in, Gupta says.

""Experience aside, Elon is a self-taught polymath. He's repeatedly innovated across fields by reading books on a subject and applying the knowledge,"" Gupta writes. ""It's how he built rockets, invented the Hyperloop (which he released to the world as a paper), and could have invented Bitcoin.

Gupta then points to this 2014 tweet from Musk as a possible coy confession that he created Bitcoin.

@X4NWO Well, now that Satoshi Nakamoto has been discovered, I guess it is case closed ... :) — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2014

But, my favorite piece of Gupta's argument is this: ""Would Elon choose a pseudonym that's an anagram for 'So a man took a shit?' Of course.""

Back in 2000, according to a story Musk told in an interview with technology journalist Sarah Lacy, he was driving along California’s Sand Hill Road in his McLaren F1 with Peter Thiel, his co-founder at PayPal. When Thiel asked, “So what can this do?” Musk replied, “Watch this” and floored the car so hard it entered a tailspin before spiraling into a crash.

Both men emerged unscathed and hitchhiked their way to a meeting with venture firm Sequoia Capital. But the anecdote has renewed relevance this week because of Lacy’s follow-up question: “Is there a parallel with how you build companies and that story?” “I hope not,” Musk said, laughing. “That could be awkward with a rocket launch.”

SpaceX has come a long way since Musk, 45, founded it in 2002. But Thursday’s explosion of a rocket preparing for launch marks another setback for the company, and for Musk. No one was injured in the incident, which SpaceX said originated in an oxygen tank while the rocket was being fueled a few days ahead of a scheduled launch. But millions of dollars in equipment was destroyed, including a satellite Facebook was hoping would bring Internet access to parts of Africa.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who happened to be in Africa at the time, posted an update saying he was “deeply disappointed” about the loss of the satellite, which could have helped his users there. Zuckerberg’s message seemed carefully worded to remain brusquely indifferent to SpaceX itself, focusing his lament on the damage to Facebook.

When launching rockets, failure is an all-too common and expensive risk. Last year, five of the world’s 86 total rocket launches ended in failure, including a SpaceX Falcon 9 that exploded two minutes after launch. Because of SpaceX’s high profile, its two failed launches in 15 months have drawn lots of media attention, heightening Musk’s reputation as a CEO who moves fast, even if it means breaking things — in spectacular fashion, in SpaceX’s case.

The SpaceX explosion is only the latest in a series of issues, both mechanical and financial, that has plagued SpaceX and Tesla, where Musk serves as CEO, as well as SolarCity, where Musk chairs the board and where his cousins serve as CEO and CTO. All three companies boast ambitious goals. SolarCity brings low-cost clean energy to the masses. Tesla aims to speed the transition to a sustainable-energy economy. SpaceX’s long-term goal is to make humans a multi-planetary species. Any one of these would be an audacious ambition for a corporate leader. All three at once may be a bit too much for any one human being.

That challenge doesn’t hinder Musk. Instead, it seems to spur him on. It’s like he’s sitting inside three racing cars at once – behind the wheel of two of them, a backseat driver in the third. Sometimes this leads to inspiring results, such as the breathtaking sight of a rocket landing agilely back on Earth after being launched to space. Other times it ends in a smoking wreck, as it did Thursday.

And yet, even this difficult trick is not enough of a challenge for Musk. He has consistently raised the bar for himself, by vowing a mission to Mars in two years, by angling to merge SolarCity with Tesla, and by doubling down on Tesla’s production goals. The problem for Musk in 2016 is, the bolder the goals become, the faster the crashes and glitches are coming.

Musk’s plan to merge Tesla and SolarCity has inspired more skepticism than encouragement among investors. The Wall Street Journal said this week that both companies are “facing financial crunches,” with Tesla planning to raise more money this year. Some investors see the tie-up as a bailout for SolarCity, which according to an SEC filing approached several companies about a buyout or investment but came up empty handed.

Integrating the companies could slow the amped-up production schedule Musk has set for Tesla. Musk is pushing to begin production of the $35,000 Model 3 by next July, a bold goal given the delays in production faced by the Model X SUV that Musk recently described as hellish and a result of the company’s hubris. The thing is, though, Tesla did overcome all of its production problems. It took longer than expected, but then again Tesla is also revamping the way cars are manufactured.

In other words, speed bumps are going to appear on the road to the future. And the bumps facing Musk’s companies, because of their high profiles, will draw attention. He may yet succeed. But right now, the setbacks and speed bumps are coming more frequently. But Musk seems happy to hit the gas pedal as he approaches them.

Musk has decided to hold a competition for fans to come up with a Tesla (TSLA) commercial -- the company's first. The suggestion came in a letter to the CEO from Bria Loveday, a fifth-grader and aspiring politician who lives near Detroit.

""Thanks for the lovely letter,"" Musk tweeted on Wednesday. ""That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!""

Bria wrote to Musk: ""I have noticed that you do not advertise, but many people make homemade commercials for Tesla and some of them are very good, they look professional and are entertaining. So, I think that you should run a competition on who can make the best homemade Tesla commercial and the winners will get their commercial aired.""

She suggested that the winner get a year of free supercharging or a Model 3 Easter Egg, in addition to getting the ad aired. She also asked Musk to ""hook me up"" with a Tesla T-shirt.

Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it! https://t.co/ss2WmkOGyk — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 2, 2017

Her father, Steven Loveday, a reporter for the electric car news site Inside EVs, told CNNMoney that Tesla doesn't need to advertise because its demand exceeds its capacity to build cars. But Loveday said he and his daughter were impressed by the quality of the fan-created videos.

Loveday said Bria planned to mail the letter the old-fashioned way to Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto, California.

""I told her that we're not going to be hearing from Elon Musk if you snail mailed it,"" he said.

So Loveday emailed the letter to Tesla public relations. He said he got a response half an hour later from a Tesla representative who reported that she was hand-delivering the letter to Musk.

""It was less than an hour and I was driving my daughter home from karate, and Elon had already responded,"" Loveday said.

A spokeswoman for Tesla told CNNMoney the company is not yet offering details of the contest. To get things started, Loveday posted several fan-made ads in a story he wrote about his daughter's letter.

And yes, he said, Tesla is sending his daughter a T-shirt ... via snail mail."

Jason Merritt/Getty Images

Elon Musk pulled his five kids out their prestigious school for gifted children school in 2014, and launched the secretive Ad Astra School.

Details about Ad Astra — which means ""to the stars"" in Latin — are sparse. Musk gave an interview to Beijing Television in 2015 and spoke about the school.

""There aren't any grades,"" Musk said, explaining that instead of treating school like an assembly line ""it makes more sense to cater the education to match their aptitudes and abilities.""

Since that 2015 interview, Musk hasn't spoken publicly about Ad Astra, and families at the school have remained similarly tight-lipped. The school has no public website, phone number, or reference of the administrators and teachers who work at the school.

But Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation, recently toured Ad Astra, and shared the ethos of the school. Diamandis' unique access to Ad Astra is likely due to the fact that Musk sits on the board of trustees of X Prize.

""One element that is persistent in that small school of 31 kids is the conversation about ethics and morals, a conversation manifested by debating real-world scenarios that our kids may one day face,"" Diamandis, wrote for the Huffington Post.

He went on to give an example of a question that teachers posed to students:

""Here's an example of the sort of gameplay/roleplay that I heard about at Ad Astra, that might be implemented in a module on morals and ethics. Imagine a small town on a lake, in which the majority of the town is employed by a single factory. But that factory has been polluting the lake and killing all the life. What do you do? It's posed that shutting down the factory would mean that everyone loses their jobs. On the other hand, keeping the factory open means the lake is destroyed and the lake dies. This kind of regular and routine conversation/gameplay allows the children to see the world in a critically important fashion.""

This type of moral and ethical reckoning isn't uncommon for Musk, who talks about the need to think about the ethical ramifications of advancing technology. It seems Ad Astra has these same types of discussions with its students.

If you are a parent of a student at Ad Astra or know more details about the school and would like to share, email ajackson@businessinsider.com."

Elon Musk started building a giant megabattery for the South Australian outback earlier this year with the aim of preventing blackouts that have been a major issue for the region. He bet that he could complete the project within 100 days. A bet upon which he wagered the cost of the project: an estimated $50 million. Now, local authorities will have to pay for the $50 million giant battery because Musk fulfilled his promise and completed the build in under 100 days.

The massive lithium-ion Tesla battery will even begin testing ahead of Musk’s Dec. 1st deadline, which is good news for the region: just last year, the area was hit with major, state-wide blackouts after storm winds literally ripped transmission towers out of the ground.

“South Australia is set to have backup power in place this summer through the world’s largest lithium-ion battery, which is set to be energized for the first time in the coming days as it enters a phase of regulatory testing,” State Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement.

Life-Saving Megabattery

As renewable energy sources advance, battery capacity is becoming more and more important to ensuring energy availability. And in a place like the southern Australian outback where blackouts are a relatively common, yet dangerous, occurrence, such a battery is essential.

The megabattery will be connected to a wind farm operated by French energy firm Neoen, and will be so large that it could hold enough energy to power thousands of homes in the event of a crisis. Not only will the battery allow the state to be prepared for emergencies, but it will also support Australia’s continued progress in switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

As the country takes steps towards this ultimate goal, efforts like the megabattery will allow for energy — like that created from the wind farm — to be stored efficiently."

He also told them that he invested in DeepMind in order to keep an eye on Google’s development of AI.

Mr Musk has called for the companies working on AI to slow down to ensure they don’t unintentionally build something unsafe.

“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” he told Rolling Stone.

“There's a lot of risk in concentration of power. So if AGI [artificial general intelligence] represents an extreme level of power, should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?”

Though he didn't expand on what sort of threat it could pose, he's previously said that AI is “a fundamental risk” to the existence of human civilisation.

He believes its development needs to be regulated “proactively”.

“I have exposure to the most cutting-edge AI and I think people should be really concerned about it,” he said in July.

“I keep sounding the alarm bell but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react because it seems so ethereal."""

Bezos, the Amazon CEO, and Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, have distinguished themselves as the must-watch innovators pushing hardest -- and most effectively -- to bring the future to us today.

They made billions in the Internet age, like many in the tech world. But Musk and Bezos' innovations aren't limited to the screens we stare at all day. They're catching the next tech wave, as the Internet overruns the physical world, whether it's cars, rockets or supermarkets.

Here's a look at the impressive run they're on:

Tuesday March 28

Amazon (AMZN), not content with dominating e-commerce, announces two grocery stores in Seattle, where Amazon Prime members can pick up their groceries at a drive-through. It's a reminder of the company's interest in reinventing the grocery store experience, a huge potential market that could push Amazon toward being the first $1 trillion company. Amazon's stock closes at an all-time high.

Meanwhile, Musk promises details shortly on a new side project, Neuralink, that will merge human brains with computers, essentially making humans into cyborgs.

Tesla (TSLA) stock surges on improving sales, passing Ford in value. While Tesla sales are a drop in the bucket compared to Ford's (F), investors realize Musk is positioned to win big as automobiles become electric and self-driving. Musk pokes fun of the investors who have bet against him. ""Stormy weather in Shortville,"" he tweets.

Meanwhile, traditional retailers appear out of their league as consumers shift online, to places such as Amazon. Urban Outfitters (URBN) announced declining sales, the latest bad news for a falling stock.

Tuesday April 4

More retailers admit they're struggling in the era of Amazon e-commerce. Staples (SPLS) is reportedly exploring selling itself. Ralph Lauren (RL) announces cost-cutting moves including closing its Polo store on Manhattan's 5th Avenue. Payless ShoeSource announces it's filing for bankruptcy.

Amazon stock closes at a record high, worth nearly twice as much as Wal-Mart (WMT).

Wednesday April 5

At a space conference in Colorado, Bezos unveils a crew capsule with huge windows from his rocket company, Blue Origin. He also reveals he's going to sell $1 billion in Amazon stock each year to finance Blue Origin.

Amazon stock moves toward a record high for a sixth straight day.

The company reminds us of its vast ambitions, cutting a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday games to Prime members.

The Wall Street Journal reports that General Electric (GE) is selling its light bulb business. The company of Thomas Edison doesn't have an equivalent innovator at its helm. This marks a changing-of-the-guard moment. The Edisons of today appear to be leading Amazon, SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA).

Thursday April 6

Amazon announces it's offering 30,000 new part-time jobs over the next year. That's on top of the 100,000 full-time jobs it's already planned for the U.S. over the next 18 months.

Meanwhile, the hyperloop transportation concept that Musk floated in 2013 takes a step toward fruition. Hyperloop One proposes routes around the United States, promising speedy travel for cheap prices.

Musk and Bezos are on a hot streak, but there are sure to be setbacks. Taking on lofty, seemingly unattainable goals has been critical to their success.

""Failure and invention are inseparable twins,"" Bezos wrote last year to shareholders. ""We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs.""

An earlier version of this story misstated when Payless ShoeSource announced its bankruptcy. Payless announced the news on April 4, not the 5th."

He’s not alone,2017-04-11 16:05:01,2019-06-24 14:49:41.968518,,"Jeff Bezos said last week he is cashing out one billion dollars of Amazon stock every year to finance his space company, Blue Origin, which aims to fly tourists to the edge of space next year.

Blue Origin refused to confirm Bezos’ investments or how long he has been putting up such a sum, though SEC filings show that Bezos sold two million Amazon shares in 2016 for more than $1.4 billion.

But whatever amount Bezos has put into Blue Origin, he’s certainly not the only tech investor looking to space—since 2002, when Blue Origin rival SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk, venture investment in the sector has increased markedly, according to analysis provided by the data firm Preqin. That year saw five deals investing $26 million. Last year, 61 deals put $462 million into space start-ups, and investors are well on pace to beat those numbers this year through 3/21.

Space businesses have traditionally been predicated on heavily regulated government contracts, with deeply entrenched industry giants taking the biggest share of the work. But in the last decade, a number of trends have made extra-terrestrial business plans more attractive to nimble entrepreneurs seeking quick returns.

Moore’s law in space

“About five years ago, 2012 was our first foray into space with [satellite imaging company] SkyBox,” Deepak Kamra, a partner at the venture fund Canaan Partners, tells Quartz. “The only other big visible one out there was SpaceX. I think VCs, what caused it to take off, people see that SkyBox got an exit valuation of $500 million [when being acquired by Google in 2014.] A lot of it is seeing that there is a venture business here that doesn’t take billions of dollars of capital.”

Skybox didn’t take a lot of capital because cheaper, smaller components allowed it to rely on small satellites, roughly the size of a shoebox, rather than much heavier and more expensive ones. That’s important in a business where the cost of putting equipment in space is typically measured in tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram.

“Now you can build a spaceship cheaply, that means that venture capitalists can play,” Kamra says, noting a number of start-ups also trying to build low-cost small rockets. “People were intimidated by the fact that you needed giant rockets.”

Canaan Partners, for example, is an investor in another satellite company, Capella Space, that will use radar to see through clouds. It is one of several new satellite companies, and accompanying plays to crunch the data they produce, that are attracting VC attention.

“The important portion of the increase (and a key part of the trend) is from people that believe, like us, that Moore’s Law has come to space,” Matt Ocko, a partner at venture fund Data Collective, writes in an e-mail, adding that “micro/nanosats able to deliver the functionality of ‘mainframe’ sats in turn enable reduced launch costs, larger constellations, faster time to return, lower aggregate risk.”

Data Collective, which is the lead investor Capella Space, also backs Planet, a satellite firm that recently acquired Skybox from Google and now operates the most satellites of any private company, and Rocket Labs, a firm building rockets to launch small satellites. Data Collective led a $75 million investment in Rocket Labs this year that valued it at $1 billion, making it the rare “space unicorn.”

Private pioneers

Almost all observers point to another space unicorn, SpaceX, as a key reason the sector is attracting more attention. It has spurred a race to cut space-access costs across the industry, further reducing the capital burden on new space companies.

Musk’s firm showed that a start-up could compete with major space players on their own terms, while driving down cost with Silicon Valley-style management. Now valued at more than $11.5 billion, the company hit a major milestone in March by flying the first-ever reusable orbital rocket booster—which promises even deeper cost reductions.

“Until recently, a big bottleneck for commercial space was simply launch capacity,” says Scott Nolan, a partner at Founder’s Fund, an early investor in the company. “SpaceX’s now proven reusability will dramatically reduce launch costs and meaningfully increase both global launch capacity and frequency. We believe this shift will enable new businesses across a number of applications, and in the process unleash the next wave of space investors.”

Like Bezos, Musk funded SpaceX himself, using earnings from the sale of PayPal to eBay. During the company’s first six years, he put in $100 million. Even then, it required an $20-million capital infusion from Founder’s Fund, run by Musk’s former colleague Peter Thiel, in 2008, before the first rocket was successfully launched. SpaceX also raised money with NASA contracts and deposits from future customers. In 2013, company president Gwynne Shotwell estimated the company had spent $850 million developing its flagship rocket to fly missions for the US space agency, mostly raised from private sources over 11 years.

Compare that to SpaceX’s most recent fundraising round, a $1-billion investment that makes 2015 an outlier in the chart above, which was co-led by Google and the mutual fund purveyor, Fidelity Investments.

That’s a sign that conventional wisdom is changing. Ocko, the investor at Data Collective, points to “VC cargo-cultism” to explain some of the growth in the sector–”Hey, SpaceX and Planet Labs are big wins, so let’s throw some money at anything that looks similar.”"
http://fortune.com/2016/08/11/how-to-think-like-elon-musk/,pos,1.0,4.103685361825807e-34,How to Think Like Elon Musk,2016-08-11 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:49:43.178506,Michael Simmons + Ian Chew,"How is it even possible that Elon Musk could build four multibillion companies by his mid-40s — in four separate fields (software, energy, transportation, and aerospace)?

To explain Musk’s success, others have pointed to his heroic work ethic (he regularly works 85-hour weeks), his ability to set reality-distorting visions for the future, and his incredible resilience.

But all of these felt unsatisfactory to me. Plenty of people have these traits. I wanted to know what he did differently.

As I kept reading dozens of articles, videos, and books about Musk, I noticed a huge piece of the puzzle was missing. Conventional wisdom says that in order to become world-class, we should only focus on one field. Musk breaks that rule. His expertise ranges from rocket science, engineering, physics, and artificial intelligence to solar power and energy.

In a previous article, I call people like Elon Musk “expert-generalists” (a term coined by Orit Gadiesh, chairman of Bain & Company). Expert-generalists study widely in many different fields, understand deeper principles that connect those fields, and then apply the principles to their core specialty.

Based on my own unscientific review of Musk’s life and the academic literature related to learning and expertise, I’m convinced that we should learn across multiple fields in order to increase our odds of breakthrough success.

The jack of all trades myth

If you’re someone who loves learning in different areas, you’re probably familiar with this phrase:

“Jack of all trades. Master of none.”

The implicit assumption is that if you study in multiple areas, you’ll only learn at a surface level, never gain mastery.

The success of expert-generalists throughout time shows that this is wrong. Learning across multiple fields provides an information advantage (and therefore an innovation advantage) because most people focus on just one field.

For example, if you’re in the tech industry and everyone else is just reading tech publications, but you also know a lot about biology, you have the ability to come up with ideas that almost no one else could. Vice-versa. If you’re in biology, but you you also understand artificial intelligence, you have an information advantage over everyone else who stays siloed.

Despite this basic insight, few people actually learn beyond their industry.

Each new field we learn that is unfamiliar to others in our field gives us the ability to make combinations that they can’t. This is the expert-generalist advantage.

One fascinating study echoes this insight. It examined how the top 59 opera composers of the 20th century mastered their craft. Counter to the conventional narrative that success of top performers can solely be explained by deliberate practice and specialization, the researcher Dean Keith Simonton found the exact opposite: “The compositions of the most successful operatic composers tended to represent a mix of genres… composers were able to avoid the inflexibility of too much expertise (overtraining) by cross-training,” summarizes UPENN researcher Scott Barry Kaufman in a Scientific American article.

Musk’s “learning transfer” superpower

Starting from his early teenage years, Musk would read two books per day in various disciplines according to his brother, Kimbal Musk. To put that context, if you read one book a month, Musk would read 60 times as many books as you.

At first, Musk’s reading spanned science fiction, philosophy, religion, programming, and biographies of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. As he got older, his reading and career interests spread to physics, engineering, product design, business, technology, and energy. This thirst for knowledge allowed him to get exposed to a variety of subjects he had never necessarily learned about in school.

Elon Musk is also good at a very specific type of learning that most others aren’t even aware of — learning transfer.

Learning transfer is taking what we learn in one context and applying it to another. It can be taking a kernel of what we learn in school or in a book and applying it to the “real world.” It can also be taking what we learn in one industry and applying it to another.

This is where Musk shines. Several of his interviews show that he has a unique two-step process for fostering learning transfer.

First, he deconstructs knowledge into fundamental principles. Musk’s answer on a Reddit AMA describes how he does that:

It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.

Research suggests that turning your knowledge into deeper, abstract principles facilitates learning transfer. Research also suggests that one technique is particularly powerful for helping people intuit underlying principles. This technique is called, “contrasting cases.”

Here’s how it works: Let’s say you want to deconstruct the letter “A” and understand the deeper principle of what makes an “A” an A. Let’s further say that you have two approaches you could use to do this:

Which approach do you think would work better?

Approach #1. Each different A in Approach #1 gives more insight into what stays the same and what differs between each A. Each A in Approach #2 gives us no insight.

By looking at lots of diverse cases when we learn anything, we begin to intuit what is essential and even craft our own unique combinations.

What does this mean in our day-to-day life? When we’re jumping into a new field, we shouldn’t just take one approach or best practice. We should explore lots of different approaches, deconstruct each one, and then compare and contrast them. This will help us uncover underlying principles.

Step two of Musk’s learning transfer process involves reconstructing the foundational principles he’s learned in artificial intelligence, technology, physics, and engineering into separate fields:

In aerospace in order to create SpaceX.

In automotive in order to create Tesla with self-driving features.

In trains in order to envision the Hyperloop.

In aviation in order to envision electric aircraft that take off and land vertically.

In technology in order to envision a neural lace that interfaces your brain.

In technology in order to help build PayPal.

In technology in order to co-found OpenAI, a non-profit that limits the probability of negative artificial intelligence futures.

Keith Holyoak, a UCLA professor of psychology and one of the world’s leading thinkers on analogical reasoning, recommends people ask themselves the following two questions in order to hone their skills: “What does this remind me of?” and “Why does it remind me of it?”

By constantly looking at objects in your environment and material you read and asking yourself these two questions, you build the muscles in your brain that help you make connections across traditional boundaries.

Now, we can begin to understand how Musk has become a world-class expert-generalist:

He spent many years reading 60 times as much as an avid reader.

He read widely across different disciplines.

He constantly applied what he learned by deconstructing ideas into their fundamental principles and reconstructing them in new ways.

At the deepest level, what we can learn from Elon Musk’s story is that we shouldn’t accept the dogma that specialization is the best or only path toward career success and impact. Legendary expert-generalist Buckminster Fuller summarizes a shift in thinking we should all consider. He shared it decades ago, but it’s just as relevant today:

“We are in an age that assumes that the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable… In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual’s leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which in turn leads to war.”

If we put in the time and learn core concepts across fields and always relate those concepts back to our life and the world, transferring between areas becomes much easier and faster.

As we build up a reservoir of “first principles” and associate those principles with different fields, we suddenly gain the superpower of being able to go into a new field we’ve never learned before, and quickly make unique contributions.

Understanding Elon’s learning superpowers helps us gain some insight into how he could go into an industry that has been around for more than 100 years and change the whole basis of how the field competes.

Elon Musk is one of a kind, but his abilities aren’t magical.

Still, that doesn’t mean that Musk is fazed by his bigger tech rival—and he’s decidedly unimpressed by its efforts to develop an autonomous vehicle.

“I don't know what they're doing on the car front,” Musk said on an earnings call Wednesday when an investor asked whether he’d consider partnering with Apple on self-driving cars, or whether he sees the company as a competitor. “It's not clear.” But Musk, who admitted he owns an iPhone, did offer up some faint praise. “It's a cool company,” he added.

“If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.”

It’s not the first time Musk has taken a shot at Apple for encroaching on his territory. When he was asked in 2015 about Apple’s rumored plans for an electric car, his response was savage. “They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard,’ ” he told German newspaper Handelsblatt. “If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.”

“Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?” he asked. “No, seriously: It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches.”

Musk may have reason to be tetchy. While Apple’s secretive self-driving car endeavor, code-named Project Titan, has reportedly been beset by obstacles—including a recent staff shakeup—C.E.O. Tim Cook also has nearly $250 billion in liquid assets at his disposal. That’s enough to buy up a number of its self-driving competitors if it chooses, including Tesla and all of Detroit. Indeed, Apple was previously rumored to be interested in outright purchasing a car company—like McLaren—and even approached Musk about the possibility of scooping up Tesla. (Musk said he wasn’t interested.)

Luckily for Tesla, Apple now appears to have other plans. Under the direction of Bob Mansfield, who developed the iPad, the company is currently focusing its efforts on developing driverless car technology, as opposed to an actual driverless car. And Apple appears to be making progress. Last week, after getting clearance from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Bloomberg spotted an Apple self-driving car in the wild: a white Lexus RX450h S.U.V. decked out with commercially-bought sensors, driving around the streets of Silicon Valley."
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/elon-musk-tesla-auto-industry,pos,0.9999999999804572,1.954636016331866e-11,How Elon Musk Crushed Detroit,2017-04-11 22:21:22.002000,2019-06-24 14:49:46.133604,Condé Nast + Maureen Dowd + Nick Bilton + Jack Howard + Nick Bilto,"Back in 2011, I sat down at a Starbucks in San Francisco with a group of executives from Ford Motor Company as they lamented what they saw as the auto industry’s impending existential crisis. We were only a few years removed from Barack Obama’s controversial, if necessary, auto-industry bailout, but global finance hardly came up during the conversation. And though we were mere years away from the meteoric rise of ride-sharing behemoths, and radical new technological breakthroughs, these innovations were not apparently on their minds, either. (At the time, Uber had the valuation of a dog-food-delivery app.) So what did the executives at Ford fear might kill their business? The iPhone.

In retrospect, they were onto something. For decades, American carmakers had what many considered the ultimate selling point in attracting young consumers. Dealers may have marketed sexy Ford Mustangs with V6 engines, or GM trucks with fancy sound systems and extra-comfy seats, but in reality they were all selling something far more ephemeral: freedom. Teenagers salivated over the notion of turning 16, getting a driver’s license, and earning independence from their parents. By the time of my conversation with these Ford executives, the auto industry had already withstood countless threats—the rise of Japanese carmakers, the advent of new manufacturing practices, and the aforementioned financial crisis—but none were as pressing as the fact that a new, relatively inexpensive device now appeared to offer teenagers a newfound digital freedom that trumped any analog competitor. “The car used to be the signal of adulthood, of freedom,” a Ford executive told me at the time. “Now, the signal into adulthood for teenagers is the smartphone.”

Perhaps no industry has suffered the cataclysms of volatility quite like the once staid and boring car business. Those executives at Ford were indeed right. While Detroit has always taken itself seriously, and correctly, as a town that made beautiful objects out of steel, companies in Silicon Valley have for some time been looking at cars just like another mobile device or app. Faraday Future, for example, approached building an entirely new car as less of an exercise in hardware than in creating software, and how to upgrade it later. Comma.ai, which was started by a PlayStation hacker, built a $999 kit to make (almost) any car into a driverless car. Then there was self-driving start-up Cruise, which was acquired by GM; and Zoox, a self-described robotics start-up with $200 million in funding, which is also building a car that can drive itself.

VIDEO: Elon Musk on Tesla and SpaceX at the V.F. New Establishment Summit

The threats, of course, now seem to be coming from everywhere. The year 2011, after all, seems almost pre-historic by today’s standards. That very year, TechCrunch had published a story about a “young start-up” called Uber, which had recently raised $11 million for a valuation of $49 million. Google, which was regularly lampooned for its seemingly quixotic quest to build a so-called “driverless car,” admitted, with uncharacteristic humility, that the company did not have any real clear plan. The Tesla Model S, the first mainstream car to hail from Elon Musk’s brainchild company, wasn’t even on the road yet.

There are few people who could have predicted what Silicon Valley would do to Detroit within the span of a decade. This week, for instance, Tesla became the most valued automaker in the United States, overtaking 108-year-old GM, in market valuation. This is just a week after Tesla passed Ford. Who knows how long it will take before Tesla zips by foreign carmakers, including Honda, BMW, and Toyota."

And any journalist who has written articles to this effect should be ashamed of themselves for lack of journalistic integrity.

Every company in the world, there's annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, despite Tesla having an extremely high standard, a standard far higher than other car companies, which we need to have in order to survive against much larger car companies ... you can't be a little guy and have equal levels of skill as the big guy. If you have two boxers of equal ability and one's much smaller, the big guy's going to crush the little guy--obviously. So, the little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill ... or he is going to be clobbered. So that is why our standards are high. They're not high because we believe in being mean to people. They're high because if they're not high, we will die. Despite that, in our annual performance reviews, only 2% of people didn't make the grade. So that's about 700 people out of 33,000. This is a very low percentage. GE, I don't know if they still do, but they certainly for a long time had a policy of firing 10% of their employees for performance every year, no matter what.

If you were to stack Tesla's performance later releases compared to other companies, the number would be low. So, the only reason these articles had any play whatsoever is because journalists and editors with low integrity fail to provide any context for where this stood because the actual article would've read, Tesla fires 2% of its employee base for performance-based reasons, a remarkably lower number compared to other companies. But of course, that would be a meaningless article, so they forget to include that. Shame."

And now, with 2017 right around the corner, it’s got us wondering what he’s gonna get up to over the next 365 days. As far as we know, the man behind the man behind SpaceX, Tesla, and Hyperloop isn’t trying to invent time travel as well (again, as far as we know), but Inverse found a way to peek into the future. Here’s what Musk will do in the new year.

Take a Victory Lap After Model 3 Debuts

With the release of the Tesla Model 3, Musk will usher in a new era of transportation. The cars work perfectly, and Musk’s company will scramble to meet demand. The autopilot will be so advanced that it’ll know when to turn itself around if the kids are misbehaving in the back seat, and one of the Easter Eggs will give the Model 3 the offensive capabilities of a Mario Kart.

Approximately one week after the Model 3 launches, Musk will tweet: “The Model 4 plans are tricky but coming together at expected rate.”

Get Shady, Shady Revenge Facebook

In early spring, Facebook’s Aquila drone will explode in a spectacular fashion. While the industrious, forward-thinking side of Musk will be sad to see Mark Zuckerberg’s latest innovation fail, his petty side will be psyched. Ever since Zuck dissed SpaceX after that unfortunate rocket explosion, Musk’s been waiting for a Facebook failure to provide him an opening to get some sweet revenge.

The day after the Aquila disaster, Musk will publicly lament the loss of a technology that could’ve provided internet to underserved areas, and then reveal he had SpaceX build a perfectly functioning internet drone of its own. The Zuckerbird, as Musk cheekily nicknamed the drone, will be a tremendous success but create an Oculus-sized rift between Musk and Facebook.

Fall Off a SolarCity Roof

Musk’s year will take a turn for the worse when he breaks his arm falling off of a SolarCity roof while trying to retrieve a frisbee.

Quietly Observe What Would’ve Been SpaceX’s Astronaut Launch Date

One day, Musk will ask to be alone. Returning to his house, the SpaceX CEO will pour a glass of wine, sit on a balcony underneath an expanse of stars, and mourn what could have been. SpaceX looks like it might still be able to send astronauts into space in 2018 but Musk, ever the perfectionist, will mourn the passing of the original, pre-delay launch date he’d so passionately envisioned.

Musk will finish the bottle of wine and, on an ill-advised whim, begin to binge re-watch Westworld. It’s too painful.

Lose Interest in His Boring Company

In late 2016, Musk announced for the tenth or so time that he was seriously, definitely, for real, gonna start a company that digs massive tunnels to alleviate traffic problems. He’ll give it a pretty good go, but by mid-2017, Musk will … just sort of stop, having moved on to a much more exciting Hyperloop development. He won’t shitcan the whole endeavor, however. In 2019 he’ll be into the boring idea again and at least then he won’t have to start from scratch.

Get Really Into Jack Kerouac

Tesla will make good on its promise that all of its cars will be fully autonomous by 2017, and Musk will celebrate by going on a cross-country road trip with his old PayPal buddy, Peter Thiel. The two of them won’t actually be doing any driving, obviously, but they’ll explore the great America southwest and learn new things about themselves on the road. Musk will get super, super into Jack Kerouac during the trip. This will be extremely phony and annoying.

Musk and Thiel’s self-driving car will only crash twice during the entire trip; once when it nails a cow in Iowa, and a second time when it collides head-on with a self-driving Uber in San Francisco. Nobody will be seriously injured (except for the cow, which will invest the settlement money in PayPal stock).

Get in a Fight With His “Boss”

For most of 2017, Musk will try to avoid spending time with President Donald Trump, on account of Trump being an ochre ignoramus. The two will occasionally squabble about little things — Musk won’t have SpaceX do work on Air Force One so it can go to Mars, Trump thinks that basic income is “basic-and-dumb” — but things will really come to a head when Musk tells Trump that he can’t just have Tesla’s autopilot run the country while he chills at Mar-a-Lago. Trump, angrily, will do what he always does when he feels slighted: Tweet about it.

Be Elected President of the Newly Seceded Nation of California

When the year starts to wrap up, things will escalate quickly. After losing Musk, Trump will lose the American people — especially Californians, who will make good on their crazy threat to secede from the union. Using a Twitter poll, the ruling class of Silicon Valley will elect Musk to be their first-ever leader. Trump will simply call Musk and his new citizens “losers and haters,” claiming that Calexit only Made America Great Again.

It won’t be until Musk orders that Trump’s twitter account be shut down that open war breaks out.

Prove That, Yes, Our Reality Actually Is a Computer Simulation

As the American-Californian War rages, advisors to President Musk will notice that he seems distracted. They wonder if maybe it’s just the pressure of the office or the horrors of war. That’s not it, though — Musk will be preoccupied because he realized he was right. None of this matters, because none of this is real.

Musk, finally, will have proven that our reality is naught but a computer simulation. He’ll have learned how to alter the source code. Whereas Musk started out the year trying to explore space with his rocket company and save time with Hyperloop, now he can alter the flow of both space and time with a wave of his hand.

He hopefully will be able to use this godlike power to prevent SpaceX’s manned spacecraft launch from being pushed back another year."

In response to a Twitter post of a humanoid robot made by Boston Robotics jumping up on raised surfaces with the caption, ""we dead,"" Musk responded with a warning:

""This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you'll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams…""

This is not the first time the billionaire tech exec has hammered home the frightening potential of AI. But robots being able to move quickly is not all scary — it is also a valuable productivity tool, according to Musk. At the beginning of November, on a conference call with investors discussing Tesla's third-quarter financial results, Musk said the production of Tesla cars will depend on robotics working quickly.

""It's remarkable how much can be done by just beating up robots ... adding additional robots at choke points and just making lines go really, really fast. Speed is the ultimate weapon,"" says Musk.

Also on Sunday evening, Musk tweeted a reminder that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated by federal lawmakers.

""Got to regulate AI/robotics like we do food, drugs, aircraft & cars. Public risks require public oversight. Getting rid of the FAA [wouldn't] make flying safer. They're there for good reason,"" Musk writes. He published the comment with a link to the music video ""Regulate,"" a rap song released in 1994 from the artists Warren G and Nate Dogg.

Musk has warned of this before, too.

""AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation than be reactive,"" according to Musk, speaking to the National Governors Association in July.

His call for regulation is because he says the potential for robotics, if left to develop unchecked, threatens human existence."

Lucy Nicholson/Reuters

Elon Musk is a man of few words, who more often than not lets his actions and delivery of results speak for himself. Results, apparently, seem to be his chosen vernacular. Having said that, there keeps coming a time when Elon drops some gems of entrepreneurial advice.

The founder of Tesla and SpaceX has had more than his fair share of criticism. Naysayers and skeptics have left no stone unturned to discourage and vilify the futuristic entrepreneur. But, Elon style, he has let his work do the talking; his results silence the critics and leave them in awe of his ongoing series of achievements, previously thought impossible.

Now, when you seek advice from an entrepreneur with mettle like that, it will not be improbable to expect a speech about breaking boundaries. Tackling otherworldly industries (literally!), whilst changing the world one product at a time.

Well, this is Elon Musk.

On one occasion while being visited at his Tesla factory by students of Draper University, he was asked by one of the students, ""As an established entrepreneur, what is the number one tip you have for all the young entrepreneurs waiting to startup?""

Here's his reply:

""I think it's very difficult to start companies, it's quite painful. A friend of mine has a good phrase for doing a startup: it's like eating glass and staring into the abyss. If you are wired to do it, then only do it, not otherwise. So think of it this way - if you need inspiring words, DON'T DO IT!""

That seems like a discouraging response to such an important question, right?

Wrong. If you take a closer look, you will see there is a whole lot more to this answer than meets the eye.

Thomas Brag, one of the students present that day explains Elon's answer.

""Firstly, being an entrepreneur has been overly glorified in movies and TV shows, but for the most part, running a company is difficult. Most of us are not ready for it or are more interested in the idea of being an entrepreneur rather than actually be willing to put in the work to become one.""

The real dynamics of entrepreneurship involve a lot of failures, risk-taking, tireless effort and a will to commit to years of work before you see any success. Most people are not wired to adopt this mentality or lifestyle and will only become very unhappy with their lives if they choose to pursue this path.

Branden Moskwa, CEO/Founder of nadimo.com agrees. ""The glorification of entrepreneurship has created a society of ignorance, a yellow brick road type of thinking. I fully support and encourage entrepreneurs, it's just that you have to start with a dirt road in the beginning, and most people don't want to believe that. Being an entrepreneur is a constant battle of balance. The successful entrepreneur embraces the daily struggle and dives in headfirst, not with blinders, but with clarity and determination.""

Brag also makes another point that Elon's advice serves as a 'poser-filter'. If you are discouraged by someone telling you not to do it, then you were not meant to do it in the first place. A strong-willed entrepreneur will have the reserves of grit and determination to not be put down by anyone's discouragement. The idea of entrepreneurship will feature in his self-actualization needs.

Therefore, if you are someone truly driven, this advice should fuel you with even more motivation to prove him wrong. Having said that, Elon also knows that this answer also serves as a fair warning for entrepreneurs to anticipate and be prepared for the failures ahead.

Speaking at the ISSR&D Conference in Washington D.C. Wednesday, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) was asked about the education system. Musk explained that he believes schools aren't doing enough to help children grasp why they're learning each subject.

""You just sort of get dumped into math. Why are you learning that? It seems like, 'Why am I being asked to do these strange problems?'"" Musk said. ""Our brain has evolved to discard information that it thinks has irrelevance.""

Musk suggested learning be focused around solving a specific problem, such as building a satellite or taking apart an engine. Then students will encounter and master subjects such as math and physics on the path to solving their problem. Understanding how to use a wrench or screwdriver will have a clear purpose.

""If you had a class on wrenches, ugh, why?"" Musk said. ""Trying to solve a problem is very powerful for establishing relevance, and getting kids excited about what they're working on and having the knowledge stick.""

Musk has shown a knack for learning throughout his career. After building a fortune with two Internet businesses, including PayPal, Musk turned his attention to electric cars and rockets. Despite little experience in rockets, he's built SpaceX into a company that's shaken up the industry with its reusable, low-cost rockets.

His goal of getting to Mars, and making humanity a multi-planetary species, drove him to become an expert in rockets.

Musk's 2015 biography memorably described how Musk quickly embraced the field after PayPal was sold to eBay (EBAY).

""We're all hanging out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some obscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been bought on eBay,"" Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor, recalled in the book.

When Musk entered the industry, all rockets were disposable and only flown once. But this March, SpaceX launched a used rocket to space, a historic first. Now Musk is hoping that by next year, its Falcon 9 booster will be re-flying even faster -- within 24 hours.

""We think we have at least a technical path to achieving that,"" Musk said. ""The key to that is that all you do is inspections."""

Elon Musk is warning that artificial intelligence is a ""fundamental existential risk for human civilization,"" and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is looking into how states can respond.

Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, made the remarks over the weekend at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island. He has long warned of the threats he believes artificial intelligence will pose, from automation to apocalypse. Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking and others have also sounded warnings over AI.

""Of all the things that I heard over this weekend with the National Governors Association, this was the one that I've spent more time thinking about,"" says Hickenlooper, a Democrat.

Not everyone at the NGA meeting received Musk's comments as warmly as Hickenlooper. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona told Musk: ""As someone who's spent a lot of time in [my] administration trying to reduce and eliminate regulations, I was surprised by your suggestion to bring regulations before we know exactly what we're dealing with.""

Other Silicon Valley thinkers are skeptical of Musk's doomsday prophesying. Yann LeCun, the head of AI at Facebook, told NPR's Aarti Shahani that humans are projecting when we predict Terminator-style robot takeovers. He says the ""desire to dominate socially is not correlated with intelligence""; it's correlated with testosterone, ""which AI systems won't have.""

Hickenlooper spoke to NPR on Tuesday evening. Here are highlights from that interview.

Interview Highlights

On the mood in the room while Musk was speaking

You could have heard a pin drop. A couple of times he paused and it was totally silent. I felt like — I think a lot of us felt like — we were in the presence of Alexander Graham Bell or Thomas Alva Edison ... because he looks at things in such a different perspective.

On the threat that AI could pose

Right now we worry about cybersecurity and issues like that, but when you really have artificial intelligence at a great level, the weaponry and the ability to shut down whole parts of our cities, the ability to create such damage by turning off the electricity, or making sure there's no water ... everyone was spellbound — I mean no one knew what to say.

On when government needs to step in

Usually what happens is something gets a little out of hand and then government begins to regulate. And [Musk] said, in this case, with artificial intelligence we need to get the regulations out well ahead of the problems appearing. Because it's going to happen so quickly that we need to have that anticipation and be working on it, because once you get to regulating something, everyone's got a self-interest, and it means taking away something from somebody who's already got it.

On how states can tackle such a big problem

Oftentimes, I think with the really difficult problems — and we're trying to do this with health care now — is to look at getting a number of state governors, both Republicans and Democrats, to come together around a specific issue and what the possible solutions are and have the governors work through possible solutions, because so often we're the ones where the solution gets implemented.

Despite being involved with a number of companies intent on making the future happen (or perhaps because of it) Elon Musk has always been interested with education. His efforts include a competition that helps students and startups develop working models for the futuristic hyperloop. More recently, Musk has donated $15 million to an XPRIZE program called Global Learning.

The XPRIZE Foundation is a non-profit organization that designs and promotes public competitions that seek to bring about technological developments beneficial to humanity. One of their programs is the Global Learning XPRIZE, the goal of which is to “empower children to take control of their learning.” More specifically, the program “challenges teams from around the world to develop open source and scalable software” to help children in developing countries teach themselves basic literacy and arithmetic skills within 15 months.

On Monday, five finalists were chosen to advance in the contest, each receiving a $1-million milestone prize. The team’s education technology solutions will be put to a field test in Tanzania this November, in partnership with UNESCO and the World Food Program (WFP).

Investing in the Future

The five finalists, which include CCI from New York, Chimple from India, Berkeley-based Kitkit School, a program called onebillion, and RoboTutor from Pittsburgh, will have to demonstrate proficiency gains in about 4,000 children in 150 Tanzanian villages after 15 months. The one that achieves this — to be announced on April 2019 — will receive the $10 million grand prize.

According to UNESCO, some 250 million children around the world lack basic arithmetic skills and 1.6 million teachers are needed to fill the gap. “The leading solutions born from this competition could provide the key to unlocking literacy for children most in need, giving them access to an education they otherwise wouldn’t have,” XPRIZE Foundation CEO Marcus Shingles told Forbes. As for Musk investing in Global Learning XPRIZE, it shouldn’t really be surprising. Investing in education, after all, is one of the surest routes to a better future."

But while dysfunction and ugly politics have been capturing the headlines, companies and celebrities have been mobilizing to aid Puerto Rico. Many of them have been making a ruckus on behalf of those suffering without power, clean water, or access to medical care, but at least one big name has been keeping his efforts relatively quiet--Elon Musk.

Bringing power back to Puerto Rico

With the entirety of Puerto Rico's electrical grid down and some places expected to be without electricity for months, residents of the island are in desperate need of alternative sources of power. That's something Musk's Tesla knows plenty about, and thankfully for Puerto Rico's 3.5 million residents, the company is happy to help.

""As soon as the storm passed, Tesla began sending hundreds of Powerwall battery systems that can be paired with solar panels to the devastated island in an effort to restore electric power there,"" reports Fortune, ""and the shipments of Powerwall battery systems are continuing.""

There are also Tesla employees on the ground helping install the systems, the article goes on to report, and Musk himself personally donated $250,000 to the relief effort. Some even see the possibility of a small silver lining in these efforts, suggesting that the devastation of the traditional power grid could provide Puerto Rico with an opportunity to build a more sustainable system.

It should also be noted that Musk and Tesla, while providing a characteristically innovative response to the disaster, are far from the only big companies lending aid. Lots of other businesses, from Starbucks to Facebook, are also donating to the relief efforts.

""With 90 percent of cell towers on the island out of service, people can't get in touch with their loved ones--and it's harder for rescue workers to coordinate relief efforts. We're working to get Puerto Rico back online. We're sending the Facebook connectivity team to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to get the systems up and running,"" Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Facebook post, for instance."
https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnels/,pos,1.0,2.094367061219646e-29,Elon Musk's Boring Company Just Hit the Boring Part,2017-08-11 01:13:17.729000,2019-06-24 14:49:59.422905,Aarian Marshall + Alex Davies + Alex Baker-Whitcomb + Brian Barrett + Stephen Witt + Paris Martineau,"It sounds like the plot of a James Bond movie: A charismatic billionaire wants to build a network of high tech tunnels beneath America's cities and slay an enemy in the process. But this isn't a summer blockbuster. It's Elon Musk's latest Big Idea. In addition to building electric vehicles, launching rockets, and colonizing Mars, Musk wants to reinvent tunneling and destroy soul-sucking traffic.

Just how Musk's latest venture, the wonderfully named Boring Company, will do that remains rather opaque, perhaps even to Musk himself. “We’re just going to figure out what it takes to improve tunneling speed by, I think, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 percent,” he said in February, with the nonchalance of someone ordering a latte. “We have no idea what we’re doing—I want to be clear about that.”

""We have no idea what we're doing"" are not words that reassure city planners, let alone the folks elected to represent the people of Hawthorne. That's the Los Angeles suburb where SpaceX—Musk's space venture—is located, and the home of the Boring Company's first big dig.

And so it was that the Hawthorne city council wanted just a bit more information as it pondered a Boring Company proposal to extend that tunnel two miles beyond the SpaceX property line. Musk dispatched a lieutenant to brief the council during last week's meeting.

“Although we are very excited about this innovative project, we want to make sure that we follow the legal procedures that we as a city council were elected to follow,” Mayor pro tempore Haidar Awad said before presiding over a forum marked by general enthusiasm but moments of wariness. And even if the city seems genuinely excited by the project, the 42-minute meeting provided a sense of just how many hurdles the budding infrastructure firm must clear to complete its test tunnel—much less a network of tunnels filled with car-toting sleds or pods flinging people about at nearly the speed of sound.

First, the Why

If digging tunnels seems grandiose, even for Musk, he would like you to remember that the average LA driver spends more than 100 hours slogging through hellish traffic each year. Musk, never known to do anything the easy way, thinks the solution is to duplicate the city's vast network of roads underground. Building tunnels in as many as 30 layers, he says, creates more than enough space to overcome the rule of induced demand that says expanding roads simply creates more congestion.

For short distances, Musk imagines cars taking an elevator underground, then zipping along on “electric skates” riding on rails at up to 125 mph. (It is worth noting that a civil engineer suggested to my colleague Alex Davies that Musk's idea belongs ""in the bullshit category."") For longer trips—say New York to Washington, DC—the Boring Company expects its tunnels to house a hyperloop. For the three or four of you who haven't heard, hyperloop is Musk's idea for whisking people between cities in levitating tubes shooting from one place to another at about 700 mph in near-vacuum.

Say hello to Godot, the Boring Company's tunnel boring machine. The Boring Company

The key to making these things work is tunneling. And the key to making tunneling work, Musk says, is improving the speed, efficiency, and cost of digging big ol' holes. Of course he's very optimistic about his prospects for this. ""It's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally,"" he said in a February TED Talk. ""I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling."" Eager to make that happen, Musk bought a used boring machine in May and rechristened it “Godot”. But he isn't waiting.

OK, So What’s This Tunnel?

The Boring Company wants to build a 2-mile test tunnel 20 to 24 feet underground. The plan calls for making it about 12 feet wide, or about the width of a standard highway lane. No need to make it any wider, SpaceX senior director of construction Brett Horton told the city council, because those car-carrying skates don't need a shoulder.

For all his talk about revolutionizing everything but revolutions, Musk isn't doing anything radical here. The Boring Company will use thoroughly conventional tunneling. “This is a proven machine that has already done a tunnel in Sunnyvale,” California, Horton said. “Same segment design, same tunnel-boring machine design. We’re not reinventing the wheel on that.” Digging this tunnel, he said, would let the Boring Company learn about the capabilities of the machine and find ways of making improvements.

Horton also told the council members that the tunneling process, which should take just eight months, would prove the company can build “safely, reliably, and for significant cost savings to traditional tunneling projects.”

How Do They Build It?

Horton took pains to explain to Hawthorne officials that construction would not disrupt anyone. Most of the work is slated for SpaceX’s campus (where, for example, the dirt gets dumped). Godot will be working so deeply underground that no one will feel it, Horton says. (Yes, that's possible if the ground is soft enough, construction experts say.) And the company will of course carefully monitor the ground level to make sure the surface isn't shifting. No one wants any sudden sinkholes.

There's a lot of stuff buried underground, of course, and Horton said the Boring Company has reached out to 19 utilities that might have lines in the area. The untold miles of gas, electric, fiber-optic, sewer, and water lines crisscrossing under the nation's cities present a knotty problem for tunnels and tunneling, especially since they can shift when the ground starts moving. The implications of hitting any of these could be really, truly bad—imagine a city's drinking water suddenly polluted with raw sewage, or a vast swath of the population left in the dark. And you think a sinkhole is bad PR.

Horton spent a fair amount of time outlining the myriad ways the Boring Company has complied with safety regs. “We want this tunnel to be ridiculously safe,” he said. “I want to be able to take my little 5-year-old and 3-year-old in the tunnel to show it to them.” CalOSHA says it issued the permits required to complete the tunnel already built on SpaceX property, but it won't start the process for the expansion until the city approves it.

The city council seemed impressed by the approach, but expressed reservations. “We can’t say necessarily, for instance, the Boring Company will put people at ease,” Angie Reyes English said. “I know you like to move fast. We like to move assuredly that we’re doing everything in the correct and right manner.”

(The Boring Company did not respond to WIRED's questions about how it plans to advance boring technology, why it thinks it might avoid an environmental review, and whether it has started reaching out to the community.)

So What's Next?

Next steps for the Boring Company’s extended test tunnel: Finishing up outreach to utility companies. Answering additional written questions from council members. And, on August 22, going before the next boring council meeting, when it just might get an official go-ahead. “It’s a hopeful target date at this point,” City Manager Arnold Shadbehr said. “This is what SpaceX is seeking—this is why [Horton] is looking at me like that.""

Then there’s the environmental review. When pressed by a city council member, Horton implied the Boring Company hopes to qualify for an exemption from the sometimes long, sometimes costly process that estimates how projects will affect the greater community. (The company says it has hired an environmental consultant.) “Because this is a test tunnel, because it's not meant for human occupancy and it's only a proof of concept, and also because all of the construction work is basically done on our private land, there is no cultural impact, there is no environmental impact, there is no business impact that this project will create,"" Horton said.

That might be a stretch. “LA is noted for subsurface contamination of all kinds,” says Thom Neff, a civil engineer who runs the consulting company OckhamKonsult. “You’ve got the tar sands, oil, natural gas—they’ve had explosions in tunnels in LA. I can’t imagine the agencies would let Musk do anything like that without a full-blown environmental report.”

But Hawthorne remains excited. “You’re knocking on the door of innovation that hasn’t happened ever,” said Awad, the mayor pro tempore. But before the Boring Company can bore, it must endure the boring task of digging through government bureaucracy."

Elon Musk wants to cover the world with internet from space

The Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is planning to put more than 4,000 satellites in orbit in order to blanket the Earth with internet access.

SpaceX, the privateer space company led by Musk, is requesting permission from the US government to operate a massive network of 4,425 satellites - plus “in-orbit spares” - to provide high-speed, global internet coverage.

Documents filed with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday propose an initial launch of 800 satellites to create an orbiting digital communications array to cover the US, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

In the filing, SpaceX said: “The system is designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, government and professional users worldwide.”

Such a system would provide a space-based alternative to cable, fiber-optics and the other terrestrial internet access currently available.

SpaceX is not the first to propose such a system. Similar internet-via-satellite networks are under development by privately owned OneWeb and by Boeing, while a $200m satellite leased by Facebook’s Internet.org initiative, which has a similar goal of providing global internet access, was destroyed in an explosion of the SpaceX launch vehicle contracted to send it into orbit.

Each satellite SpaceX proposes to put into orbit, without its solar panels extended, is the size of an average car, measuring 4m by 1.8 by 1.2m and weighing 386kg. SpaceX has not set a date for the satellite launches, but said that they would orbit in a range between 714 miles and 823 miles above the Earth.

Musk said in January 2015 that the plan would cost at least $10bn.

It gained $1bn in funding from Google for the project. Google has been attempting to perform a similar feat, blanketing the globe in internet access, using high-altitude balloons. Facebook’s other internet initiatives have revolved around the use of high-altitude solar-powered drones.

SpaceX operates a satellite launching business, with contracts with Nasa for supplying the International Space Station - the first privateer space firm to do so. But its rocket launches have been on hiatus since 1 September following the Falcon 9 booster explosion.

The company hopes to resume launch operations next month."

On September 20, the Category 4 hurricane named Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico. Thirty-four people died, and most of the island’s 3.4 million residents struggled to access clean water, food, and medical care in the weeks that followed.

One of the most poignant displays of the island’s continued disarray? Now, three weeks after the storm has dissipated, more than 80 percent of the island is still without power. The storm damaged all facets of the power grid — how power is generated, how power is transmitted, and how power is distributed — making the process of repair far more challenging than on neighboring islands, New Scientist reports. Officials estimate that it could take months for citizens to get their electricity back, or even longer.

That is, unless Elon Musk steps in.

Prompted by a Twitter user, on October 5th, Musk noted that Tesla could get involved in restoring the island’s power. Notably, this power would be clean and renewable:

The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017

Ricardo Rossello, Puerto Rico’s governor, promptly responded to Musk’s tweet. Rossello tweeted that an initial phone call between the two was promising:

Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow. — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 7, 2017

The two men recognized the great potential in the wake of Puerto Rico’s destruction. “Although in the short-term the object would be to bring power to the largest number of people, we shouldn’t sacrifice this opportunity to have an energy system that is resilient, modern, and can be at cutting edge on the global level,” Rossello said in a subsequent press conference.

A Shift In The Business

Neither Rossello nor Musk has provided much detail about what the plan would look like. But on smaller islands, Tesla has installed a microgrid, a distributed network of batteries and solar panels that operates independently of the standard electric grid. The solar panels collect energy when they can; the batteries store that energy for later use.

This kind of distributed system can bring electricity to those residents more quickly than repairing the traditional electrical grid. That’s clearly a good thing.

But could the shift away from traditional systems ultimately punish citizens?

Right now, the government-owned corporation Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) supplies power to all of the island. That power is generated primarily through burning petroleum, natural gas, and coal, which is imported. If more individual homes are outfitted with their own sources of power generation, they will become less reliant on PREPA. This trend is happening elsewhere in the United States, too, from New York to Arizona.

This shift could be financially more disruptive than straightforward privatization, in which government-owned utilities (power, waste management, water) are handed to private companies that run each part of the process. That is because privately owned companies are heavily regulated so that they don’t jack up prices and take advantage of consumers. But the combination of regulation and competing companies that answer to shareholders who want to turn a profit often means that consumers don’t see much difference in how much they pay for power; in some cases, individuals even pay less in privatized systems.

“There have been a lot of studies on the cost of electricity generation for public and private utilities. It makes no difference. There’s a wide range of results, with no real pattern as to whether public or private was better [for citizens],” John Donahue, the faculty chair of the Masters of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, told Futurism.

“Musk’s pitch might be good news for rate payers, bad news for electricity workers.” ”

“As a customer in a privatized system, you can be confident there will be incentives in place,” Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University, told Futurism. But, he notes, there are downsides, too: “If you’re working in the privatized system, you won’t do as well. You could lose your job.”

To this end, a push towards individualized power generation could come with a similar trade-off for citizens, at least at first: they might pay less for electricity on a monthly basis, but those employed by the power company might lose their jobs.

“Musk’s pitch might be good news for rate payers, bad news for electricity workers. That’s probably the bottom line,” Donahue said.

Risky Renewables?

Shifting to the microgrid also comes with new risks that weren’t present in the traditional power system. The solar panels and battery packs are expensive; users often need years to recoup their investment. Musk isn’t letting on how much he’s going to charge for Tesla’s systems, or who will be paying for it, but given Puerto Rico’s sizable debt, it might be a tough decision if the government uses an outsized portion of its recovery funds to restore power using Tesla’s tech.

It’s particularly knotty because the island will probably have to rebuild its traditional grid anyway. The batteries that store energy aren’t as efficient, and they need to give people access to electricity 24/7, Wolak said. So when the Sun isn’t shining, everyone will need backup power from the grid all at the same time. The supply and demand of electricity will fluctuate dramatically, causing a headache for the power company, which will need to generate that power only intermittently and can’t loop in to a larger grid due to Puerto Rico’s isolation.

“You hear people talk about how Denmark’s electricity is 80 percent renewable. But it’s interconnected with the rest of Europe. So they can install a lot of wind, but if the wind isn’t blowing [Denmark] gets electricity from other regions,” Wolak said. The same thing is happening in California, where natural gas powers homes to make up for solar’s down time. “Puerto Rico is an island. If there’s no sun or wind, there’s no transmission line to Miami.”

“It’s not going to be the lowest-cost way to get electricity back up.”

“[Installing a microgrid] would effectively amount to discarding a lot of capacity that’s already there,” Wolak said. “It’s not going to be the lowest-cost way to get electricity back up.” Moreover, installing a microgrid in a market of this size has never been done, Wolak said. And it’s a gamble to see if it will work — a politically palatable one, but a gamble nonetheless. “Everyone loves renewables. But this is not something that we have a proof of concept anywhere,” Wolak said. “Maybe it’s not the best time to do it for Puerto Rico as it’s trying to recover.”

We may soon find out if the gamble pays off. Just a week after Musk spoke with Rossello, a shipment of Tesla’s Powerpacks was spotted at Puerto Rico’s airport."
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/26/elon-musk-hates-hydrogen-but-automakers-are-still-investing-in-it.html,pos,1.0,3.034216943416355e-29,"Elon Musk hates hydrogen, but automakers are still investing in it — and for good reason",2017-05-26 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:50:05.736751,Robert Ferris,"Elon Musk is no fan of hydrogen fuel cell technology, but some of the world's major automakers still think it is a bet worth making.

The Tesla CEO has called fuel cells ""mind-bogglingly stupid, "" ""incredibly dumb"" and ""fool cells."" Musk's complaint is that using hydrogen as a mechanism for storing energy would be less efficient (i.e., result in more electricity lost) than simply using electricity to charge batteries. Other critics have variously cited such things as costs, safety and the lack of supporting infrastructure, among other things. But other automakers are saying fuel cells are a better bet than critics claim. Some of the world's largest automakers are leasing fuel cell cars to customers, committing to improve fueling infrastructure and showing off new models at the world's premier auto shows, even as they explore other alternatives to the gasoline engine. Fuel cells have their own limitations, but they may be here to stay. And they may end up maintaining certain advantages over battery electrics, even as technology improves for both powertrains. Toyota unveiled the fuel cell powered Mirai in Japan in 2014. Honda released the Clarity fuel cell car last year, based on an earlier concept vehicle. Hyundai's luxury Genesis brand unveiled a hydrogen fuel cell SUV at the New York Auto Show earlier this year. Meanwhile, Hyundai already offers a fuel cell version of its Tucson, and Mercedes is launching a car this year that combines fuel cells with plug-in electric technology. Others are expected in the years to come. In the short term, pure battery electrics are expected to outpace fuel cells, among non-gasoline engine cars. Battery electrics are forecast to be 4 percent of the total car market by 2025, from about 1 percent today, while fuel cells will only be 0.5 percent of the total market, according to IHS Automotive.

Charging is really the Achilles' heel of the battery electric. We have places to charge, but the length of time it takes to charge is still an issue. Devin Lindsay Principal analyst, IHS Automotive

""Realistically, the electrification of vehicles is almost entirely built around lithium-ion electric in the next five to seven years,"" said Brett Smith of the Center for Automotive Research. He added that the improvements in battery technology over the last several years has been impressive, exceeding many expectations. And Tesla in particular has shown what can be accomplished with a vision. But he added: ""I think the internal combustion engine is still a tough target."" He said he is among those still skeptical that pure electrics will be able to displace it without a ""revolution"" in battery technology. The central issue is that battery electrics can still only go so far before the batteries need to be recharged, and that can be time consuming . Tesla's Superchargers, which may be the fastest chargers around, can recharge a battery to roughly 80 percent of its capacity in about 30 minutes. But that is still a lot longer than it takes to refill a gas tank. ""Charging is really the Achilles' heel of the battery electric,"" said Devin Lindsay, principal analyst at IHS Automotive. ""We have places to charge, but the length of time it takes to charge is still an issue."" It would be especially difficult for drivers on tight schedules, and for people who do not have access to a charger — such as people who live in apartment buildings or who park on the street. Fuel cell cars, on the other hand, can be refilled about as quickly as gas tanks, offer longer ranges on a single fill, and may be preferable for larger vehicles, especially heavy duty trucks or industrial equipment. So they do not require consumers to change their behavior when switching from gasoline engines, said Craig Scott, director of the Advanced Technology Group for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. ""Living with an EV requires you to modify your behavior,"" Scott said. ""You have to think about where you are going to charge, and you have to think about how far you can go on that charge. And that is why, today, most people who buy [battery] EVs report that it is their second or third vehicle. Today, 94 percent of the people who buy the Mirai are reporting that they are replacing their primary vehicle. That is a very, very clear indication of people's mindsets. One they view as a replacement to their current vehicle, another they view as a supplement. ""

Irresistibility of convenience

Companies betting on fuel cells are, in part, betting on the irresistibility of convenience. Of course, Tesla's top-shelf cars can travel more than 335 miles on a single charge. For a battery-only electric, that is a remarkable achievement. Tellingly, though, Musk acknowledged how difficult it was to squeeze that extra 10 kilowatt hours into a battery that size, and said the company will not put a battery larger than 100 kWh in the Model S, X, or 3, meaning the company will have to find another way to push range higher. Meanwhile, the Honda Clarity fuel cell electric gets 366 miles on a single fill, according to Honda. Fuel cells may be especially useful in certain applications. Any vehicle on a tightly managed circuit, such as a delivery truck, city bus, or other similar vehicle , would work quite well with hydrogen. ""Where hydrogen would make sense is where high-capacity electric cars are already making the most sense, which is in super-controlled, standardized environments,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. There are already 14,000 hydrogen fuel cell forklifts operating across the United States, for example, said Keith Malone, a spokesman for the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a public-private partnership between the auto industry and the state of California to promote fuel cell transportation.

Hydrogen may never make sense for consumer vehicles. But it does make sense for B2B and B2C vehicles that do community standardized shuttling and personal transportation services. Karl Brauer executive publisher, Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book

Tellingly, Amazon recently bought a stake in Plug Power, which makes fuel cells. Amazon aims to use it to power forklifts in its warehouses. Other companies have also begun to invest in fuel cell tractor trailer trucks. ""Hydrogen may never make sense for consumer vehicles,"" as we conceive of them now, Brauer said. ""But it does make sense for B2B and B2C vehicles that do community standardized shuttling and personal transportation services. And don't forget that a lot of people are saying that is where we are heading anyway. A lot of people are saying hydrogen fuel cells sync well with something else coming up fast: self-driving cars."" In particular, hydrogen cars could work just fine in fleets of shared, autonomous vehicles, which some have suggested could be a big part of the future of everyday transportation. Just like their battery electric counterparts, hydrogen cars could be stored in facilities near fuel sources and then summoned when needed, reducing the need for a vast infrastructure of filling stations catering to individual owners. The quick refilling time would mean cars could be redeployed more quickly, keeping fleets smaller. The technology has its flaws. Critics and skeptics say fuel cell cars require a lot of energy to harvest the hydrogen needed for the tanks. Right now, a fair amount of this hydrogen is a byproduct of natural gas extraction or similar processes that are far from carbon neutral. To be fair, solar and wind energy could be used to extract hydrogen, said Malone. California already requires that 33 percent of the hydrogen used in the state must be harvested using renewable energy. Hydrogen fuel cell cars are also complicated, and they take more time and money to build than an internal combustion engine. For example, the Financial Times reported it takes 72 minutes to build a Toyota Mirai, compared with just 60 seconds for a regular internal combustion engine car. If Tesla's aggressive push into improving manufacturing efficiency bears fruit, the company has promised it could provide a blueprint for electric vehicle that could be tough for complicated alternatives to catch up with. Then there is the matter of infrastructure. Building hydrogen fueling stations cost about five times what it takes to build a conventional gas station. Fuel cell cars need a refueling infrastructure, mechanics and a supply chain for parts. Finally, fuel cell cars are still expensive, due in part to their complexity and the materials used. The Honda Clarity may offer more range than a $69,000-plus Tesla Model S for less money, but both the Clarity and Toyota's Mirai start at just below $60,000 without incentives. But these kinds of challenges are hardly unique to fuel cells, said IHS' Lindsay. And companies have made some improvements, such as by reducing the size of certain components, as Toyota has done with its Mirai. As with many clean energy technologies, California has taken the lead among U.S. states in developing a program to support hydrogen fuel cell cars. There are currently 27 refueling stations throughout the state, and there are plans to get to 100 by 2020. From there, the state aims to multiply that by a factor of five or 10, Malone said. For now, manufacturers can also earn more zero-emission vehicle credits in California for hydrogen cars, than they can with battery electrics, Lindsay said. ""Right now, even in limited volume, they can earn a decent number of credits"" by selling far fewer hydrogen cars than battery electrics, he said.

https://mashable.com/2017/10/03/tesla-model-3-production-woes-analysis/,pos,1.0,1.3999813943104951e-14,Tesla Model 3 production can't keep up with Elon Musk's Twitter feed,2017-10-03 00:00:00,2019-06-24 14:50:06.859517,Lance Ulanoff,"Tesla Model 3 production really is hell.

Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder and CEO, warned us in July as he delivered the first 30 all-electric Model 3 cars to buyers who also happened to be employees.

SEE ALSO: Driving a Tesla Model 3 is pretty damn awesome

“The major challenge you face with the Model 3 is not with the product itself — it’s an amazing car — but we're going to go through basically about six months of manufacturing hell,” said Musk in July.

On Monday, Tesla reported it has produced just 260 Tesla Model 3 cars, its first mass-market all-electric sedan, in the last quarter. That’s approximately 120 cars a month, a number that would be less distressing if Musk himself hadn’t predicted producing as many as 20,000 Model 3 cars a month by December of this year.

Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017

Tesla reported half a million Model 3 pre-orders in late July. At the company’s current production pace, Tesla Model 3 customer 500,000 might not see her all-electric sedan until the year 2363.

What’s far more likely is that it will be a few years or more before Tesla gets through all its orders, and those who ordered first will endure the highest level of frustration as their cars will probably be delayed the most. A lot of people in the middle of the product delivery queue could receive their Model 3’s at the same time and, eventually, ordering a Model 3 could be as easy and commonplace as buying a Ford Focus.

It will probably work this way because we are on the flat end of the S-curve manufacturing efficiency trend Musk explained in July.

“The biggest challenge we face here is getting the S curve manufacturing. That S proportion is us going through hell, basically. I have high confidence that we’ll get to the end of S curve, but it is almost impossible to predict the exact shape of it in the interim period,” said Musk in July.

This is Elon Musk with his showman cap off, doing his best to explain the fundamental realities of virtually any manufacturing process: They start off slow with low output as the production line works out manufacturing and supply kinks and then curve dramatically up as the buffer of available parts builds. Production speeds up dramatically until it flattens out again, but at a higher, more sustainable pace.

This is not the kind of information consumers like to hear, so Musk is often hesitant to deliver it, leaving numbers like 20,000 by the end of December and 500,000 by the end of next year out there for consumers to spin into unrealistic expectations.

Musk is only slightly more circumspect when talking to investors. Just days after the first Model 3 deliveries, Musk told them on an earning call.

What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult production ramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team, and I'm very confident that we will be able to reach a production rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, on track to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year.

So, I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendar boundaries of a quarter, one quarter or the next, because when you have an exponentially growing production ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, but that is simply because of the arbitrary nature of when a quarter ends.

Yes, he still promised 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by the end of the year, but warned about how small changes could have big impacts and the need for them to not focus on the boundary dates for quarters.

It’s like he wanted them to hear “end of the year,” but think, “at some point in an indeterminant future.”

Musk said in July that with 30% of the Model 3’s parts sourced from outside the U.S. the Model 3 is subject to “force majeure risk” — global events, like floods, fires, tornadoes and sunk ships, that could adversely affect the supply chain.

There’s been a lot of calamity in the world in the last few months, but, apparently, it’s not the source of the production issues. “…there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,” Tesla said in the release.

It might be a while before you see your Model 3. Image: lance ulanoff/mashable

The cause is Tesla’s own facilities: “production bottlenecks” at both its Fremont production plant and the massive Gigafactory in Nevada.

Considering how much Musk said Tesla learned from the production hell it went through with its previous Tesla models, this is surprising. Musk recalled in July how the Roadster, its first electric car, was the worst. “We went through hell and then actually did a return journey,” Musk said, “We had to redo almost the entire car and recapitalize the company, which sucked.”

With the Model S, of which there are now more than 230,000 on the road, the company literally worked “night and day and at a maximum sprint pace,” to reach its current 20,000-a-year run rate.

The core lesson: “You have to improve the efficiency of production so you can actually build the 20,000 at a sustainable pace without sucking up weekends and burning a candle at both ends,” said Musk in July.

Based on what Musk told us, the Model 3 is a product of all those lessons. Not only does it have fewer bells and whistles, “there’s nothing in that car that doesn’t need to be there. Everything in the car has a compelling reason,” said Musk.

There were roughly 30 Model 3's ready to go on July 29. Tesla managed to produce another 230 Model 3 cars since then. Image: lance ulanoff/mashable

Doug Field, Tesla’s VP of Engineering said they designed the Model 3 to move as quickly through production as possible, while maintaining as high production quality as possible.

“We have simplified manufacturing process dramatically,” added Musk, “In the same amount of space it takes to build 50,000 Model S’s, we can build 250,000 Model 3s. That’s a five-fold improvement in manufacturing density.” (Musk’s habit of throwing out aspirational production numbers that he knows will be reported far and wide is almost like a tic.)

Where, exactly, those production bottlenecks exist is, since Tesla isn’t saying, anyone’s guess, but it doesn’t take much to slow down a production line like this. As Musk explained in July, “There’s 10,000 unique components in the car and production will move as fast as the slowest one.”

So, it could be the battery pack. It could be the single screen dashboard. It could be the computer controlling it, or it could be the large glass panel that covers much of the car’s roof.

Beyond statements made in the release, Tesla wouldn't comment on the delays.

No matter where it is, the numbers speak for themselves: 260 Model 3 cars off the production line. Even with an S-Curve, it’s is hard to imagine that in fewer than three months, Tesla will rocket to 20,000 a month.

Tesla and Elon Musk are not purposefully lying about delivering these cars. The company has built tens of thousands of Model S and Model X cars. Musk has a track record of execution across multiple companies: Tesla (including Powerwall), SpaceX, the Boring Company.

I’m not doubting Musk’s ability to deliver these cars. They will come, but perhaps Tesla and Musk should stop publicly predicting rapid manufacturing advancements and promising, especially on Twitter where there’s almost no context, big production numbers on any time table.

There are 500,000 customers waiting for their Model 3’s. I think its time for Musk to simply say: You’ll get them when you get them."

A few years ago, Musk put forth the initial idea for a hyperloop—a high-speed, solar-powered transportation system that would shoot passengers in a vacuum tube from point A to point B at hundreds of miles per hour—and released the preliminary concept as an open-source project. Companies have since begun to race to turn his quixotic vision into reality: Musk himself is developing hyperloop-related technology through his newest venture, a tunnel-building project he calls the Boring Company, though his progress in California seems to be stalled until he can dig any further into the city of Los Angeles than the SpaceX parking lot, and he appears to be more focused on more pragmatic means of conveyance. Last week, Capital News Service reported that Musk has secured a conditional permit to “begin digging two parallel, 12.4-mile transportation tunnels in January 2018” in Baltimore, likely using a slower, Minority Report-like technology that would transport cars on electric sleds. Branson, meanwhile, is doubling down on the original concept. In September, his Virgin Group helped lead an $85 million fund-raising round in Hyperloop One, which has since rebranded as Virgin Hyperloop One. Now, Branson has increased his involvement with the company, which has raised an additional $50 million in new funding and agreed to add Branson as its chairman, Axios reports.

Virgin Hyperloop One has encountered its share of roadblocks as it works to build out Musk’s vision of a supersonic mass-transit system. Last summer its co-founders sued each other amid allegations of nepotism and threats of violence. And while the company celebrated its first successful test of its system this summer, its hyperloop vehicle only traveled at about a tenth of the 700 miles-per-hour speed it eventually plans to achieve. The new cash infusion was necessary, Axios reports, as Virgin Hyperloop One had been running low on funds.

Virgin Hyperloop One’s new funding is also strategic: the company’s new funding comes from Dubai’s DP World and Russia’s Caspian Venture Capital, which, Axios notes, lets the company keep ties with the Middle East and Russia, two parts of the world where it hopes to ink contracts next year. One elephant in the room is the involvement of co-founder Shervin Pishevar, one of the co-chairs Branson will replace at Virgin Hyperloop One. Pishevar, who was a party in last summer’s legal battle, resigned from the company’s board earlier this month amid a number of allegations of sexual harassment not related to the company. (Pishevar has denied any wrongdoing.) The other lingering question for both Musk and Branson’s endeavors is the feasibility of hyperloop technology. The land rights necessary to build a hyperloop track on private and public land, for instance, could be a major headache, and the estimated costs are staggering—not to mention the provisions necessary to ensure safety when human beings in pod-like contraptions are traveling at the speed of sound. Accelerating cars on tunnel tracks may be the slower, safer option until the concept is proven."

He's now worth $16.6 billion, but getting to that net worth was far from an overnight success story.

Below are some of the most resourceful ways in which he made money before becoming a famous billionaire.

He created and sold his own video game at the age of 12.

It was a space-themed game called Blastar, where the objective was to destroy an alien ship filled with weapons of mass destruction. Musk had been interested in computers from an early age, and taught himself programming starting at 9-years-old. He received $500 when the source code for the BASIC-based game was published in South African magazine PC and Office Technology. It was the first product Musk ever sold; he reportedly called it a ""trivial game… but better than Flappy Bird.""

He once took a job as a boiler room cleaner at a lumber mill.

After leaving South Africa in 1988, Musk spent time working a series of odd jobs around Canada. According to Ashlee Vance's biography on him, Musk first tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin's farm in Waldeck, and then learned how cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver. After a visit to the unemployment office, he inquired about the job with the best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill. For $18 an hour — a great wage in 1989 — the grueling work involved wearing a hazmat suit, crawling through small spaces, and shoveling residue in extremely high-temperature conditions, according to Musk.

He landed an internship with the Bank of Nova Scotia by cold calling a top executive to meet for lunch.

After reuniting with his brother Kimbal in Canada, the two determined brothers researched businesspeople that they wanted to meet and took turns making cold calls to ask if they could have lunch. One such businessman was Peter Nicholson, a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia, who was fascinated by the boys' initiative. Upon meeting them, he was so impressed with Elon — the geekier of the two brothers — that he became his mentor and offered him a summer internship at the bank for $14 an hour.

To earn extra cash, Musk sold computer parts and full PCs out of his dorm room.

While at Queens University in Ontario, Musk had a profitable side hustle for a time. He sold entire computers, as well as various hardware parts, from the comfort of his dorm room. He would build whatever suited the needs of fellow students - like a tricked-out gaming computer or a simple word processor, for example. As Musk described, ""if their computer didn't boot properly or had a virus, I'd fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem."" Not bad for the guy who would eventually become the inspiration for Tony Stark in Iron Man.

He paid for rent in college by converting his house into a nightclub.

After transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, Musk quickly put his entrepreneurial instincts to good use. He and a friend moved into a 10-bedroom frat house off campus for relatively cheap. During the week, the two of them would study, but on weekends, they turned the place into ""a full-out, unlicensed speakeasy,"" according to his roommate Adeo Ressi. This included covering the windows with black trash bags and the walls with bright paint. Musk, who was never big on drinking except for the occasional vodka and Diet Coke, would stay sober for these events to keep things under control. He would run the parties, and as he explained, ""I was paying my own way through college and could make an entire month's rent in one night."" Once, his mother Maye even worked the door at one of the big parties.

In 1995, Musk quit graduate school at Stanford University to co-found an internet startup.

Despite getting accepted to a Stanford Ph.D. program, Musk forwent the tuition costs when he decided after two days that the internet had far greater promise to change society. He immediately dropped out and teamed up with his brother Kimbal and started Zip2, a company that provided maps and directories to online newspapers. To start the venture, they used $28,000 out of their father's bank account.

He first became a millionaire four years later, when he and his brother sold Zip2.

It was bought by early PC company Compaq in 1999, who had become a leading supplier of PC systems until it was overtaken and bought out by HP in 2002. The Zip2 deal amounted to $307 million; Musk's share of the proceeds was a tidy sum of $22 million.

Musk scored a net return of over $165 million after his financial services company, X.com, merged with PayPal - which was bought by eBay.

Soon after the sale of Zip2, Musk invested $12 million of his own money into co-founding X.com, which he envisioned as the future of online banking. In early 2000, X.com merged with its rival Confinity, and the company was renamed PayPal. As the majority shareholder, Musk was ousted as CEO amid protracted boardroom squabbling. PayPal then accepted eBay's offer to buy in July 2002 - against Musk's advice. After the 1.5 billion deal finally went through, he came away with $180 million after taxes."

According to Vance, the assistant, Mary Beth Brown, asked Musk for a significant raise after she'd been working with him for 12 years. In response, Musk told Brown to take two weeks off, during which he would assume her responsibilities and see whether she was critical to his success.

When Brown returned, Musk told her he didn't need her anymore.

Musk also told Vance that he offered Brown another position at the company but that she never returned to the office after that.

Musk has since tweeted that the anecdote is ""total nonsense.""*

He continued: ""Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist.""

""MB was given 52 weeks of salary & stock in appreciation for her great contribution & left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist,"" Musk said.

The idea of proving your worth to a company through a test of this type is pretty extreme, but it's a solid lesson in knowing what you're worth to your organization.

Business Insider spoke with Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and the author of "" Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job."" She shared a few strategies for assessing your value — before someone else does it for you — and boosting it.

First, Taylor said, you'll want to do an ""audit"" of your responsibilities. Take 15 minutes one day to think about what exactly you're working on.

""Could a temp do what you're doing and keep your boss happy?"" Taylor said. If the answer is yes, or even maybe, you might need to step up your game.

Above all, Taylor said, ""you want to make your boss need you — not just have you on board."" So consider what makes your boss successful and how can you align yourself with that, she said.

Some people call it "" managing up"" — it's about figuring out how you can make your boss look good to their boss.

One tactic is to flat-out ask your boss whether you're adding enough value to the organization. You don't even have to wait for your next performance review, Taylor said.

While you're discussing some other project, you can say: ""By the way, I want to make sure that I'm really providing the most value-added work that I can. I know you have a lot on your plate — are there any areas that I could work on, on my time, that would help make your job easier?""

Come prepared with specific examples of how you could help. For example, let's say you know your boss has been working on a tough project, and that you have some solid research experience from your past job that could be an asset to this project.

You could tell your boss: ""I noticed that you were working on XYZ. I know that my background in X might be able to take care of some of the more routine aspects of that, but maybe even some strategic aspects of that. I'd love to give it a shot if you're open to it.""

The bottom line is that you want to make yourself an integral part of your boss's success — and the company's. What happens after that is out of your control.

""No one is indispensable,"" Taylor said. ""It's just to what degree are you harder to replace.""

Belvedere,"Mention Elon Musk and let the superlatives fly.

But former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo just brought praising Musk — the billionaire entrepreneur behind electric cars and solar power solutions, space travel, and ambitions of digging transportation tunnels under cities — to a whole new level.

""Elon may be proof that time travel exists, because he seems to have either more hours in the day than the rest of us have, or he's from the future,"" joked Costolo, in a CNBC interview on Thursday.

""In all seriousness,"" Costolo continued, saying, ""I'm laughing because [Musk's] ability to think cogently and thoughtfully about such a wide range of topics, while running these multiple companies, and seeming to be running them well is just, I mean, it makes you shake your head. It's remarkable.""

These multiple Musk ventures to which Costolo referred are Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company.

Costolo's comments on ""Squawk Alley"" came after Musk tweeted about getting ""verbal"" government approval to begin building an underground hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C.

Musk's latest big dig announcement is typical Musk, Costolo said. ""What he's been able to publicly announce he's going to try to do, and then goes ahead and does it in a number of fields all at once, it's just extraordinary. I just don't think there is ... [anyone] else out there like it.""

""Listen, when you say it, it sounds a little bit crazy — he's landing a rocket on a drone ship at sea. I mean this is something he's done,"" Costolo added. ""So you just ... have to shake your head at what he's been able to accomplish,"" he added.

In a wide-ranging CNBC interview, Costolo also offered advice to Snapchat-parent Snap on how to deal with the threat from Facebook copying all its features. He was drawing on his own experience leading Twitter and how it handled competing with Mark Zuckerberg's social networking behemoth."

As CNN reported, this is ""the first time in the history of spaceflight that the same rocket has been used on two separate missions to orbit.""

The day after this historic accomplishment, Musk went on Twitter to deliver the following message:

Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours. -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2017

The tweet is only 19 words, but it packs a major punch. And it holds some important lessons for anyone who is leading a team.

Here are two major takeaways:

1. Focus on your team's accomplishments. Not your own.

It would be easy for Musk, the founder and driving force behind SpaceX, to take credit for this achievement.

Instead, he focuses on his team.

It's sincere, specific praise like this that motivates employees, makes them feel like part of the team, and builds an environment where the whole becomes much stronger than the sum of its parts. (Musk isn't the only one to figure this out. Just check out this recent letter from Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, or this old email from ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.)

So how can you put this into practice?

Take a moment today to gather your team. Tell them what you appreciate about their work and why. Keep it real.

Do this, and your people will go on to accomplish great things--because you convinced them that they could.

2. Keep moving forward.

Musk does a great job of recognizing the accomplishment, but he's not satisfied to sit and bask in the glory--and he doesn't want his people to do so either.

By immediately stating SpaceX's next goal, Musk demonstrates a mindset of continuous improvement. He also shows us what clear, unambiguous communication looks like.

If you're leading a team, you need to:

Maintain a clear vision, and set the milestones that will lead the team to bring that vision to fruition

Keep challenging your people to the right degree, because they're looking for opportunities to grow

Your people are capable of great work. The leader's job is to show them which way to go, and to keep them on course."

One thing you won’t hear him championing is the unfettered rise of artificial intelligence, which he once described as the “biggest existential threat” to humankind.

Musk’s prejudice prompted him to donate millions to the ethics think tank OpenAI—and it’s why he’s urging other billionaire techies like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet’s Larry Page to proceed with caution on their myriad of machine learning and robotics experiments. OpenAI is both an ethics and a research institution. Its mandate (plucked from its website): “Because of AI’s surprising history, it’s hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, it’ll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self-interest.”

For more insight into Musk’s motivation, I recommend Maureen Dowd’s treatise in the latest issue of Vanity Fair. Ostensibly, her article is about Musk, but she also does a masterful job of revealing where noted AI enthusiasts stand on the ethics debate. For example, Ray Kurzweil, who writes often about the coming merger of man and machine as part of his “Singularity” thesis, says “both the promise and peril are deeply intertwined.”

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter, where this essay originated.

My gut reaction after reading Dowd’s feature was this: Methinks Musk doth protest too much. After all, Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are inherently dependent on machine learning software. Ditto, the rockets being developed by his SpaceX venture. Or as newly unemployed AI expert Andrew Ng, who quit his job at Baidu last week, told her: “I think it’s fascinating that in a rather short period of time he’s inserted himself into the conversation on A.I. I think he sees accurately that A.I. is going to create tremendous amounts of value.”

Is Musk really that frightened or is he just putting on a show to stoke our innate paranoia about smart machines? I’m not sure the answer really matters. Either way, he’s raising our collective consciousness."

And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government, predicts Elon Musk, the iconic Silicon Valley futurist who is the founder and CEO of SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX.

According to Musk, there really won't be any other options.

""There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,"" says Musk to CNBC. ""Yeah, I am not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen.""

In a country with universal basic income, each individual gets a regular check from the government. Switzerland considered instituting a universal basic income of 2,500 Swiss francs ($2578) a month this summer. Voters ultimately rejected the plan, but it sparked a broad, global conversation.

Also this summer, President Obama addressed the idea of a universal basic income in an interview with the Director of MIT's Media Lab, Joi Ito, and Scott Dadich, editor in chief of WIRED: ""Whether a universal income is the right model — is it gonna be accepted by a broad base of people? — that's a debate that we'll be having over the next 10 or 20 years."""

It's a setback for Mark Zuckerberg's plan to provide free connectivity to Facebook and other selected sites to sub-Saharan Africa, since part of that payload was a satellite that would have supplied the connectivity to the region.

While most of the world is referring to the event as an explosion, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk insisted to a questioner on Twitter that the event was really ""a fast fire, not an explosion."" The SpaceX website refers to the incident demurely as an ""anomaly."" Which seems like an awfully tame word for something that rattled windows as much as five miles away.

You may know all about the explosion, but did you know that was just one of many matters coming to a head for Musk this week? Consider:

Musk is about to announce improvements to Tesla's autonomous feature after a fatal crash.

Autopilot, you may recall, is the feature blamed for the death of a Tesla owner back in May, when the Tesla's cameras and radar failed to see a semi truck that had pulled in front of the car. The crash made headlines both because it was the first time a self-driving vehicle has been involved in a fatal collision and also because Tesla did not reveal the crash to investors or consumers--or the SEC--until months later.

Improvements to Autopilot would be welcome news for Tesla enthusiasts, and Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he was about to announce them. But after the SpaceX explosion the following day, the planned announcement appears to be pushed back until at least next week.

Tesla is raising more money to buy SolarCity.

Also on Wednesday, Tesla revealed in an SEC filing that it would need to raise more capital to complete its $2.4 billion purchase of SolarCity, a company Musk funded and of which he is chairman. Some have criticized the deal as forcing Tesla investors to fund SolarCity because the rooftop solar panel provider is running out of cash.

Meantime, the company plans to ship a new, affordable electric car next year.

The planned release of the Tesla Model 3 has been pushed back from this year to the end of 2017.

And it's building a $5 billion battery factory in Nevada.

The factory, already partially open, supplies the Tesla household and business batteries Musk hopes will help change the world. But the plan is for the factory to mass-produce lithium ion batteries that will power Tesla vehicles. Like many Musk-related projects, it is badly behind schedule.

Oh, yeah, and then there's the Hyperloop.

Musk has proposed a high-speed transportation system using reduced-air-pressure tubes that would shoot pods full of passengers from one location to another, specifically L.A. to San Francisco and vice versa. Though SpaceX is the impetus behind the project, it does not intend to actually build the Hyperloop, at least so far. Instead, it's been holding design competitions. The first round of competition has been completed. A second round, in which teams build actual pods to run in a mile-long tube or track that SpaceX will supply, was originally scheduled for last month, but has been pushed back to January 2017.

Are you keeping count? At one and the same time, Musk is trying to get us to Mars by 2025, create vacuum-powered transport up and down the West Coast, help Mark Zuckerberg put a satellite in space to wire some of the poorest areas of Africa, make safer autonomous cars, build a ginormous battery factory, and purchase a struggling green-tech company he helped launch.

These are worthy endeavors, every single one of them. And it's beyond commendable that Musk is throwing his considerable genius into the fight against global warming, an effort that too few billionaires have joined. But even the incomparable Steve Jobs ran only two major companies at a time."

The Tesla CEO made the promise on Twitter, replying to Atlassian CEO and Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes. The conversation came after similar remarks from Lyndon Rive, Tesla’s vice president for energy products, who said earlier in the week that his company would commit to solving South Australia’s energy issues with 100 to 300 megawatt-hours of battery storage. Like Musk, Rive said Tesla could install the required batteries within 100 days. ""We don't have 300MWh sitting there ready to go,” he said, “but I'll make sure there are.”

@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Musk said Tesla would get the system installed and working within 100 days of signing a contract. For his part, Cannon-Brookes requested seven days to “sort out politics and funding,” and asked the Tesla CEO to DM him an approximate quote for a 100MW battery farm — at “mates rates.” Musk replied a short time later specifying that Tesla would charge $250 per kilowatt-hour for 100MWh systems like the one discussed, and that the company was moving to a fixed, open pricing structure for its battery farms.

@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Assuming Musk can indeed secure a deal with the Australian government, it seems that Tesla has the capabilities to make good on its founder’s promise: the company built a similar 80MW farm in California last year in just 90 days.

The last blackout took place in February

The Australian state has suffered from a spate of blackouts over the past six months, with the most recent taking place in early February, during a 104 degree heatwave. The Australian Energy Market Operator has blamed the blackouts on a number of factors, including higher-than-expected demand, but the topic has become a political battleground, with the Australian government pointing to the failure of renewable energies to cover usage.

Coal-fired power plants have been closing across Australia in recent months, hiking energy bills and contributing to blackouts like those suffered in South Australia. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has pushed for a return to the fossil fuel as part of a “coal-fired future,” but Tesla’s battery technology may help wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources persist in Australia. Musk’s battery farms can store huge amounts of energy generated by these renewable sources and siphon it off during busy times, theoretically eliminating blackouts."

Then, asked by Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes on Twitter how serious Rive’s guarantee was, Musk responded confidently: “Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?”

Australia is in the midst of a gas supply shortage, which has threatened the nation’s power reserves. A recent report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), an organization that manages much of the energy markets and power systems on the continent, predicted that declining gas production could lead to major electricity deficits as soon as summer 2018.

Meanwhile, south Australia has been hit particularly hard, with its 1.7 million people facing frequent energy cutbacks and power shortages. Last September, a slew of storms led to a statewide blackout that left some without power overnight.

As Vox’s Brad Plumer detailed in 2015, though Tesla may be known for making electric cars, it has been investing heavily in the manufacturing of other kinds of battery technologies, including a standalone lithium-ion battery that individuals can buy for their homes or businesses. In January 2017, this culminated in the completion of the “Gigafactory,” a massive battery cell production plant in Nevada that Bloomberg said would soon be the “world’s biggest factory.”

Musk’s certainty in his company’s ability to bring power to Australia so quickly comes in part from a similar success last year. A massive gas leak in late 2015 and early 2016 outside Los Angeles led to a fear of energy shortages throughout Southern California. Tesla built a 20 MW/80 MWh battery storage plant nearby in just three months.

Though it’s possible Musk and Tesla could achieve what they guaranteed in that short time frame, it could also just be a publicity stunt. Musk has a history of making odd or even outrageous claims, such as his belief that we all live in some advanced civilization’s video game simulation, or that humans will colonize Mars within the next decade.

Tesla factory workers reveal pain, injury and stress: 'Everything feels like the future but us'

When Tesla bought a decommissioned car factory in Fremont, California, Elon Musk transformed the old-fashioned, unionized plant into a much-vaunted “factory of the future”, where giant robots named after X-Men shape and fold sheets of metal inside a gleaming white mecca of advanced manufacturing.

The appetite for Musk’s electric cars, and his promise to disrupt the carbon-reliant automobile industry, has helped Tesla’s value exceed that of both Ford and, briefly, General Motors (GM). But some of the human workers who share the factory with their robotic counterparts complain of grueling pressure – which they attribute to Musk’s aggressive production goals – and sometimes life-changing injuries.

Ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing and chest pains, according to incident reports obtained by the Guardian. Hundreds more were called for injuries and other medical issues.

In a phone interview about the conditions at the factory, which employs about 10,000 workers, the Tesla CEO conceded his workers had been “having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs”, but said he cared deeply about their health and wellbeing. His company says its factory safety record has significantly improved over the last year.

Musk also said that Tesla should not be compared to major US carmakers and that its market capitalization, now more than $50bn, is unwarranted. “I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve,” he said, pointing out his company produces just 1% of GM’s total output.

“We’re a money-losing company,” Musk added. “This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It’s just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?”

Musk’s account of the company’s approach differs from that of the 15 current and former factory workers who told the Guardian of a culture of long hours under intense pressure, sometimes through pain and injury, in order to fulfill the CEO’s ambitious production goals.

“I’ve seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake and smash their face open,” said Jonathan Galescu, a production technician at Tesla. “They just send us to work around him while he’s still lying on the floor.”

He was one of several workers who said they had seen co-workers collapse or be taken away in ambulances. “We had an associate on my line, he just kept working, kept working, kept working, next thing you know – he just fell on the ground,” said Mikey Catura, a worker on the battery pack line.

Richard Ortiz, another production worker, spoke admiringly of the high-tech shop floor. “It’s like you died and went to auto-worker heaven.” But he added: “Everything feels like the future but us.”

Tesla sits at the juncture between a tech startup, untethered from the rules of the old economy, and a manufacturer that needs to produce physical goods. Nowhere is that contradiction more apparent than at the Tesla factory, where Musk’s bombastic projection that his company will make 500,000 cars in 2018 (a 495% increase from 2016) relies as much on the sweat and muscle of thousands of human workers as it does on futuristic robots.

“From what I’ve gathered, Elon Musk started Tesla kind of like an app startup, and didn’t realize that it isn’t just nerds at a computer desk typing,” said one production worker, one of several who asked not to be identified by name. “You really start losing the startup feel when you have thousands of people doing physical labor.”

In February, Tesla worker Jose Moran published a blogpost that detailed allegations of mandatory overtime, high rates of injury and low wages at the factory, and revealed that workers were seeking to unionize with the United Auto Workers.

Moran’s post shone a spotlight on a workforce that is almost entirely absent from Tesla’s official images of the factory.

Michael Sanchez once had two dreams: to be an artist and a car service technician. He said he was “ecstatic” when he was recruited five years ago to work at Tesla, a company he believed was “part of the future”.

Now Sanchez has two herniated discs in his neck, is on disability leave from work, and can no longer grip a pencil without pain.

Tesla said that the employee’s injury occurred while he was installing a wheel, but Sanchez said it was caused by the years he spent working on Tesla’s assembly line. The cars he worked on were suspended above the line, and his job required looking up and working with his hands above his head all day.

“You can make it through Monday,” Sanchez said. “You can make it through Tuesday. Come Wednesday, you start to feel something. Thursday is pain. Friday is agonizing. Saturday you’re just making it through the day.”

Tesla’s manufacturing practices appear to have been most dangerous in its earliest years of operations. The company does not dispute that its recordable incident rate (TRIR), an official measure of injuries and illnesses that is reported to workplace safety regulators, was above the industry average between 2013 and 2016.

Tesla declined to release data over those four years, saying such information “doesn’t reflect how the factory operates today”.

The company did release more recent data, which indicates its record of safety incidents went from slightly above the industry average in late 2016, to a performance in the first few months of 2017 that was 32% better than average. The company said that its decision to add a third shift, introduce a dedicated team of ergonomics experts, and improvements to the factory’s “safety teams” account for the significant reduction in incidents since last year.

Musk said safety was paramount at the company. “It’s incredibly hurtful, and, I think, false for anyone to claim that I don’t care.” The CEO said his desk was “in the worst place in the factory, the most painful place”, in keeping with his management philosophy. “It’s not some comfortable corner office.”

In early 2016, he said, he slept on the factory floor in a sleeping bag “to make it the most painful thing possible”. “I knew people were having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs. I wanted to work harder than they did, to put even more hours in,” he said. “Because that’s what I think a manager should do.”

He added: “We’re doing this because we believe in a sustainable energy future, trying to accelerate the advent of clean transport and clean energy production, not because we think this is a way to get rich.”

Tesla workers who spoke to the Guardian echoed this sense of pride and enthusiasm for the company’s mission. “We’re changing the world,” enthused Ortiz. “I can’t wait for my granddaughter to one day go to class and say, ‘My grandfather was in there.’”

But that pride did not erase what Ortiz described as a prevailing mood of “mass disappointment” over working conditions and what he alleged were avoidable work-related injuries.

He recently lost the strength in his right arm, a situation he said was “scaring” him. “I want to use my arm when I’m retired,” he added.

Others described repetitive stress injuries they linked to working long hours. Before the company reduced the average time of a workday in October 2016, workers said they routinely worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week. Tesla said the change had been “a success”, and resulted in a 50% decline in overtime hours.

Sanchez and other workers said they believed more injuries occurred because, for years, the company did not take worker safety seriously, with some managers belittling their complaints and pressuring them to work through pain.



When workers told managers about pain, Sanchez said they responded: “We all hurt. You can’t man up?” Alan Ochoa, another Tesla worker who is currently on a medical leave with an injury, alleged that superiors “put the production numbers ahead of the safety and wellbeing of the employees”.

The company said that Ochoa and Sanchez are especially outspoken workers whose views do not represent the wider workforce. However, the Tesla spokesperson added: “In a factory of more than 10,000 employees, there will always be isolated incidents that we would like to avoid.”

Complaints about working conditions at Tesla are not universal. “I’ve got benefits, I’ve got stocks, I’ve got [paid time off],” said a worker who has been at the company for about a year. “I thoroughly enjoy my work and I feel I’m treated fairly.”

Another worker, a temporary employee, said that he sees some teams in the factory doing group stretches in the morning to prevent injuries.

When workers told managers about pain, they responded: 'We all hurt. You can’t man up?'

However, some Tesla workers argue the company’s treatment of injured workers discourages them from reporting their injuries. If workers are assigned to “light duty” work because of an injury, they are paid a lower wage as well as supplemental benefits from workers’ compensation insurance, a practice that Tesla said was in line with other employers and California law. Tesla said some injured employees are also able to undertake “modified work” on regular pay.

“I went from making $22 an hour to $10 an hour,” said a production worker, who injured his back twice while working at Tesla. “It kind of forces people to go back to work.”

“No one wants to get a pay cut because they’re injured, so everyone just forces themselves to work through it,” added Adam Suarez, who has worked at the factory for about three years.

Tesla said it was determined to further improve its safety standards. “While some amount of injuries is inevitable, our goal at Tesla is to have as close to zero injuries as possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry worldwide,” the spokesperson said.

Musk has a well-documented tendency to promise Mars and deliver the moon. His electric car company was, by his own admission, a gamble. Musk said starting a car manufacturer from scratch was likely “the worst way to earn money, honestly”, though he caveated that “maybe rockets are a bit worse”. He said: “On a risk-adjusted return basis, an auto company has to be the dumbest thing you could possibly start.”

The company has succeeded at increasing its production rate every quarter. In the first three months of 2017, the factory produced more than 25,000 cars – a Tesla record. To meet Musk’s goal for 2018, they will have to quintuple that rate.

“I think one of the major problems is that people at the top are making unrealistic quarterly goals,” said a worker on the battery pack line.

Three workers described a management tactic of assigning a monetary value to every delay on the assembly line. “One time the robot came down and [the supervisor] came back screaming at us, ‘That’s $18,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 because you guys can’t get this done,’” Gelascu recalled.

Tesla argues the challenge in building vehicles from scratch with new production and manufacturing methods should not be underestimated, but that “nothing is more important” than protecting the health and safety of its workers.

“We’re trying to do good for the world and we believe in doing the right thing,” Musk said. “And that extends to caring about the health and safety of everyone at the company.”

It’s a more humanistic tone than the one he strikes with investors. “You really can’t have people in the production line itself. Otherwise you’ll automatically drop to people speed,” he told investors in an earnings call last year. “There’s still a lot of people at the factory, but what they’re doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But in the production process itself there essentially would be no people.”

As Musk’s Boring Company starts tunnelling, could his plans for underground roads and Hyperloop trains prove the doubters wrong?

In early August, the city council of Hawthorne, California, held a special meeting. It had set aside this time to discuss a major construction project proposed by a high profile company based there in the sprawling Los Angeles basin.

The company was Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, the rocket-building offshoot of the electric car company Tesla, run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. SpaceX had recently spun off another entity, this one aimed at disrupting the tunnel boring business, cheekily named the Boring Company – and it needed the City of Hawthorne’s cooperation.

“We want to prove our technology,” Brett Horton, senior director of facilities and construction at SpaceX, told the city council. The company had recently purchased a used tunnel boring machine from another California city and had begun testing its capabilities below its parking lot. But SpaceX wants to go further, tunnelling a roughly two-mile path beyond its property line and under the streets of Hawthorne. It’s a fairly quotidian infrastructural endeavour, but one tied to a grand vision.



Musk wants to build a vast network of tunnels below cities like Los Angeles in which cars and people will be whisked across town on electrically driven platforms at speeds of 125mph. Like the swooping and merging lanes of an interstate highway, the tunnels would criss-cross the metropolis, far below ground level. Elevators would bring cars, cargo and other vehicles down into tunnels and into the system of tubes on what the Boring Company calls an “electric skate”, then back up another elevator at the desired destination – apparently bypassing all traffic above ground.

“Traffic is driving me nuts,” Musk tweeted in December. “Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging …”



The digging has begun. The company has bored about 160 feet under its own property, with no reported complications. The proposed two-mile extension is being presented as a laboratory for increasing the speed and reducing the cost of tunnelling. It’s a new frontier for a parent organisation that has already developed transformative automobile and rocket technologies.



We want these tunnels to be everywhere Brett Horton

“The next step is to use what we learn to make stronger, faster tunnel boring machines, to make a safe transportation system, and then to figure out where we want to go next,” Horton told the city council. “If you’ve had the opportunity to look at the videos online, it’s not a secret. We want these tunnels to be everywhere. We want to duplicate the road network in LA underground.



“We want to prove that we can solve traffic once and for all,” he said.



From the aspirational to the absurd

Usually these types of proposed projects don’t get built. Sometimes they’re mere marketing or self-promotion, other times they’re earnest suggestions for a better world – either way, they’re almost always able to generate a conversation.



“Visionary proposals are an essential way to come together in discussion about the city,” says Nicholas de Monchaux, an associate professor of architecture and urban design at the University of California, Berkeley. Big ideas for the future city are nothing new, and although these schemes can sometimes seem preposterous in their ambitions, de Monchaux says they have a power to inspire.

One of the earliest and most enduring visions of an ideal society is presented in the book Utopia, published in 1516 by the lawyer and philosopher Thomas More. “Utopia literally described an island of cities that didn’t exist and couldn’t exist,” says de Monchaux. “But utopias help us think about the world as it actually is and ways we might want to change it – or not.”



Perhaps because of its role in modern life and its impact on urban form, transportation has long been the starting point for these thought experiments. And as technology evolves, these ideas have taken on a variety of new forms, ranging from the aspirational to the absurd.



Near the far end of that spectrum, a company in China gathered global attention in 2016 with plans to build a lane-straddling bus – a novel contraption designed to carry hundreds of passengers over two lanes of traffic, theoretically bypassing congestion. The prototype of a sort of double-wide subway car on stilts, was completed a few months later and given a test run, with regular passenger vehicles driving underneath. But within days the project was stalled, and was abandoned less than a year later after it was accused of being little more than an investment scam. The founder of the company behind the project and 31 employees were recently arrested on suspicion of illegal fundraising.



Although criminal futurism apparently does exist, most of these types of proposals are typically altruistic. In London, a series of aspirational projects have rolled out in recent years presenting new forms of infrastructure aimed at improving the city for cyclists. The London Underline proposes repurposing disused tube tunnels into cross-city bike routes – a scheme for which its designer, the global architecture firm Gensler, was awarded the Best Conceptual Project at the 2015 London Planning Awards.

We want this to be an awesome project that propels us into the future Hawthorne mayor Alex Vargas

SkyCycle, a slightly less realistic idea from Foster + Partners, suggests adding 220km of bike lanes atop the alignments of suburban rail lines. And then there’s the £600m proposal to build a floating pontoon bike path on the Thames. These projects have gathered accolades and interest, but they’ve also been criticised as distracting policymakers from pursuing more achievable cycling improvements.



Similar concerns have been raised about another Musk idea, the pneumatic tube-based intercity transit system known as the Hyperloop. Though still in early test phases and with significant hurdles in the way of even a small-scale rollout, the proposed technology has spurred the launch of multiple companies and coverage by media around the world.

Some worry it’s diverting investment from proven and existing transportation technologies like high speed rail. But for the private companies competing to build the first viable Hyperloop system, traditional high speed rail can’t beat a 700mph tube.

Musk seems to agree. Although he originally released the Hyperloop idea to the global community in 2013 in the hope that someone else would bring it to reality, now that Musk has his own tunnelling company he has apparently decided to merge the Hyperloop with his underground tunnel traffic solution. “Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop,” Musk tweeted in July. “NY-DC in 29 mins.”

While Thomas More sought to use his imagined cities to raise questions and inspire new ways of building society, Musk is looking to put shovels – and tunnel boring machines – in the ground.



Construction ‘within weeks’

On 22 August, officials from the Boring Company were back at Hawthorne City Hall, a squat concrete building where a scale model of a SpaceX rocket sits on display in the central atrium. The company was seeking city council approval of an easement allowing it to use subterranean land beneath public property for its two-mile test tunnel, and affirming its exemption from review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Lawyers for the Boring Company explained the tunnel’s proposed path: an L-shaped route that would mostly run beneath city streets at depths ranging from 22ft to 44ft below the surface. An environmental consultant explained that a lack of significant impacts to traffic, air, water or noise enables the tunnel to avoid CEQA review under an exemption typically used to streamline infill urban development.



Aside from one member of the public voicing concern about a tunnel collapse and a few questions from council members about the environmental review process, the project was not controversial. The council voted 4-1 to approve the easement.



A few details are still to be decided before a final permit can be issued, but strong city support is likely to ease that process. “We want this to be an awesome project that propels us into the future,” Hawthorne mayor Alex Vargas said.



Horton, through a communications official, declined to comment after the vote.

The tunnel is expected to take five months to build, and construction could begin within weeks.

America'S Worst Bmw Mechanic.,"Tesla’s had something of a rough go lately. Long the disruptive darling of both the automotive and tech worlds, the automaker has struggled to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan to meet its self-stated targets, and in addition to facing numerous worker lawsuits over alleged discrimination, it is now facing questions and criticism over the allegedly performance-related firings of hundreds of employees. As to how that last point was reported in the press, CEO and founder Elon Musk did not mince words.

During a conference call with investors tonight where Musk addressed both the Model 3's production problems and the company’s record $619 million quarterly loss, he yelled “SHAME” at the journalists who covered the firings, according to our own Ryan Felton, who was on the call, and numerous other reporters listening in.

Musk said that in the context of things, 700 employees being fired out of a 33,000-strong workforce isn’t that big a deal—especially, given that it says they were for standard performance reviews that happen on a yearly basis—and that compared to other companies was a fairly standard move.

But critics have decried the firings as being a move to disrupt possible unionization efforts and not really performance-related the way Tesla has said. There’s also now an active lawsuit, first reported by Jalopnik, that hits at the very issue at-hand: whether or not Tesla violated state law, requiring them to give employees 60 days notice of their termination.

Musk was apparently not happy about this:

The company’s strategy in dealing with critical stories has been especially aggressive while the Model 3 has been in its so-called “production hell.”

In response to a Wall Street Journal story about Model 3 parts being made by hand, Tesla said in a statement “For over a decade, the WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with misleading articles that, with few exceptions, push or exceed the boundaries of journalistic integrity.”

And in a statement in response to The Guardian’s story on discrimination lawsuits filed against Tesla by workers, the automaker said “We are disappointed that The Guardian, a corporation that ironically have a track record of proven discrimination, is displaying a complete lack of journalistic integrity by misrepresenting this matter to generate clicks.”

Or what's not working at the company? SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Bridgewater founder and co-chairman Ray Dalio both want their employees to do just that. Though correcting a multibillionaire a tech titan or one of most powerful people in finance sounds intimidating, both Musk and Dalio have intentionally developed company cultures where employees feel they can speak up when something is broken, problematic or when the leadership is wrong. That's because both men know that excellence requires hearing from everyone on your team. ""Evidence shows that minority opinions improve decision-making even when they are incorrect,"" says Adam Grant, organizational psychologist, top-rated professor at Wharton business school and author of The New York Times best-selling books ""Give and Take, "" ""Originals "" and ""Option B.

""Your probability of making a smart decision or coming up with a creative solution to a problem actually goes up, and the reason for that is that dissenting opinions force us to reexamine our criteria, to reconsider our processes and all the options available. Instead of leading to convergent thinking they stimulate divergent thinking and really increase diversity of thought,"" he tells CNBC Make It. Grant has talked to Musk about the culture of SpaceX.

""One of the things he's tried to do ... was to make it unsafe not to speak up,"" says Grant of what Musk revealed during their conversation. ""One of their early launches had a major explosion, and Elon had asked going into the launch for the top 10 risks and the factor that caused the explosion was number 11. "" So Musk worked to build an environment at SpaceX where employees feel empowered to voice their concerns. ""He said, 'Look even if you see something that might be totally irrelevant if you think there's a tiny possibility that it could affect our success, please let me know.' And he said, 'If people are going to be afraid, I'd rather they're afraid of what will happen if they stay silent than being afraid of what will happen if they speak up,'"" Grant remembers. ""'And we're not going to have a culture where the messenger gets shot. We're going to celebrate the person who called a potential threat or risk to our attention.'""

But there are risks to be considered too. What if a nuclear war, an asteroid collision or a rogue AI sent it all up in smoke, blotting out our own fragile existence?

Luckily, Elon Musk is one step ahead and last year outlined his ambition to send humans to Mars as a “backup drive” for civilisation. Now, the billionaire entrepreneur has provided further details of his vision to make humans a multi-planetary species in a breezy paper, published in the appropriately-titled journal New Space.

The paper outlines early designs of the gigantic spacecraft, designed to carry 100 passengers, that he hopes to construct.

“The thrust level is enormous,” the paper states. “We are talking about a lift-off thrust of 13,000 tons, so it will be quite tectonic when it takes off.”

Creating a fully self-sustained civilisation of around one million people – the ultimate goal – would take 40–100 years according to the plans. Before full colonisation takes place, though, Musk needs to entice the first pioneers to pave the way.

The current situation is summed up in a Venn diagram showing two non-intersecting circles representing, on one side, the kind of people who would be up for getting on the Mars rocket and, on the other, those who could afford this kind of adventure. An optimistic estimate of the current cost is put at $10bn per person.

“What we need to do is to move those circles together,” Musk explains. If the mission cost could be dropped to the cost of an average US house price, he predicts, people would start to sign up in big enough numbers to kick off project multi-planetary civilisation. “Given that Mars would have a labor shortage for a long time, jobs would not be in short supply,” he points out.

Throughout, the paper strikes a buoyant, even jocular tone and doesn’t get excessively bogged down in technical detail. One section entitled “Why Mars”, spells out that red planet is essentially the best of a bad lot. “Venus is a high-pressure – super-high-pressure – hot acid bath ... not at all like the goddess,” Musk writes. “So, it would be really difficult to make things work on Venus.”

The moon is dismissed for being too small for the overarching vision: “I actually have nothing against going to the moon, but I think it is challenging to become multi-planetary on the moon because it is much smaller than a planet.”

“It would be quite fun to be on Mars because you would have gravity that is about 37% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and bound around,” he adds, predicting that journey times could eventually be cut to 30 days.



The spaceship’s design is summed up as: “In some ways, it is not that complicated,” which critics might point out runs contrary to the reputation of this field of science.

Financially, there are some challenges ahead, the paper acknowledges: “We have to figure out how to improve the cost of trips to Mars by five million percent”.

However, Musk has some ideas for how such tremendous savings might be achieved. Reusing rockets could reduce the cost of spaceflight one thousandfold and refilling fuel in orbit rather than landing could make considerable savings too.

Space scientists remain sceptical about the vision, however.

In a recent interview, Ellen Stofan, former Nasa chief scientist, dismissed the idea that there would ever be a mass transfer of humans to another planet, adding that trumpeting the idea risked being a distraction from the problems faced on our home planet. “I don’t see a mass transfer of humanity to Mars, ever,” she said. “Job one is to keep this planet habitable ... There isn’t a planet B.”

Commenting on Twitter, Mark McCaughrean, senior advisor for science and exploration at the European Space Agency, struck a combative tone. “It’s a wild-eyed investment pitch, pumped up by the enthusiasm of credulous fanboys brought up on comic book sci-fi, wrapped in evangelism of saving humanity from itself and the problems we’ve wrought on this planet, a kind of modern day manifest destiny,” he tweeted in response to the paper.

“I’m less concerned about making humans a multi-planetary species than I am about making the Earth a sustainable multi-species planet, before we go gadding off colonising the solar system,” he added.

Prof Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said that the question of whether present or past life existed on Mars needed to be answered before a manned mission, which could contaminate the surface, could be considered. “There’s a moral imperative to keep Mars as it is for the moment. Until we’ve conclusively answered that question we should keep our feet on the ground ... going there would be cosmic vandalism.”

And what is the timescale for the project? Musk states that he is being “intentionally fuzzy” about when the vision might become a reality, though one slide specified the first flights could start as early as 2023. “If things go super-well, it might be in the 10-year timeframe, but I do not want to say that is when it will occur,” the paper said."

Maye Musk, the latest CoverGirl model and mother of Elon, told the New York Times that she's still waiting for the Model 3.

""I haven't gotten the 3 yet. I'm at around 300,000,"" she told the NYT. ""Even though I have good connections, I can't jump the line.""

The Model 3 is Tesla's first mass-market sedan and the wait for the vehicle stretches at least a year-and-a-half for those who order today.

Tesla plans to start producing 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in December, so Maye Musk is likely looking at a 2018 delivery time, though she may get it earlier if she ordered a Premium trim.

Maye Musk isn't the only relative to get denied special treatment. Lyndon Rive, the former CEO of SolarCity and Musk's cousin, once asked Elon Musk for a ""family member discount"" for a Model S.

Asked by Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes if he was serious about being able to build a battery system powerful enough to back up South Australia's entire power system, Musk Tweeted:

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

And now -- less than 100 days after contract signature -- the battery is built.

Serious as a heart attack

Back in March, South Australia was still reeling from the aftereffects of a series of blackouts that struck the state in September and December of 2016, and then again in February 2017 as well. The first two outages were caused by storm damage to the state's electrical grid, while the February outage was due to overuse in the middle of an Australian-summer heat wave. Among other victims of the outage, Adelaide-based Flinders Medical Centre hospital lost power when its backup generator failed, requiring more than a dozen ICU patients to move to another hospital where the generator was still working.

Capitalizing on the crisis, Musk boasted that Tesla could, if asked, build South Australia a 129-megawatt battery backup system to help prevent a repeat of the preceding six months' problems. The ""Tesla Powerpack"" battery would be fed electricity from 100 wind turbines at French renewable energy company Neoen's Hornsdale Wind Farm. With more than 100 megawatts of storage capacity, it would be able to provide continuous power to more than 30,000 homes -- about the number that lost power in the big September 2016 blackout.

Tesla expected to book $50 million in revenues from the project, money it would forego if Musk failed to deliver on time. Lucky for him, South Australia waited six months to officially sign the contract, so Tesla was able to get half the project completed before the clock even started ticking. Less than two months later, the work is already done -- and the world's biggest Powerpack battery is ready to go online on Dec. 1.

What comes next?

South Australia was not Tesla's first foray into the field of megabattery-building (although it is, for now, its biggest) -- and it probably won't be its last. In January, Tesla cut the ribbon on a nearly as big 80-megawatt backup battery built for electric utility Southern California Edison.

More recently, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Musk declared that there is ""no scalability limit"" on Tesla's Powerpack batteries. If asked, Musk said that what Tesla has already done for Southern California and Southern Australia it can do for Puerto Rico as well -- rebuild the island's entire powergrid, and back it up with a massive Powerpack system.

Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello was quick to respond, talking with Musk by phone and then scheduling a meeting with Tesla's people to ""explore opportunities"" to make Puerto Rico into a ""flagship project"" for Tesla's Powerpack.

Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow. — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 7, 2017

Is Musk's offer realistic? South Australia apparently feels that 129 megawatts of electric storage provides a sufficient buffer against catastrophe to ensure the power needs of its population of 1.7 million. Puerto Rico's population of 3.4 million is only twice that of South Australia. It stands to reason, therefore, that a Tesla Powerpack of 260 megawatts or so might provide the necessary minimum level of safety for PR -- and Musk says that by the end of next year, Tesla's Gigafactory will be producing 35 gigawatts' worth of battery packs annually.

From a business perspective, therefore, this sounds like a project that Tesla could make happen. As for funding it, well, South Australia's Powerpack cost $50 million to put in place. Assuming a megabattery for Puerto Rico would need to be twice as big, this still implies a price tag of only $100 million. And as we've seen, the U.S. government has already agreed to foot an $860 million bill (to hire The Louis Berger Group) to begin supporting ""critically needed temporary power for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.""

Long story short: It looks to me like the money is there. Musk assures us that production capacity is no constraint at the Gigafactory. And with political support from Puerto Rico's governor lined up, there's every chance Tesla's next big power project may be to rebuild the Puerto Rican electric grid."

Step by Step: How Elon Musk Built His Empire (by Anna Vital)

“The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.” – Peter Thiel in “Zero to One”

In the book Zero to One, prominent entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shares his vision on what it takes to create an extraordinary company.

Specifically, Thiel believes that instead of making incremental upgrades to an existing product or service, a company must aim to do something completely new to avoid ruthless competition. While Thiel has worked with many impressive people over the years, Thiel points to Elon Musk as a particularly successful member of the Paypal Mafia that has gone “zero to one” many times.

The Résumé

At only the age of 44, just “some” of Musk’s successes include building the world’s first global online payments company (Paypal) and landing re-usable rockets on ocean platforms (SpaceX). He also co-founded SolarCity, which just closed a $338 million round for providing commercial solar and energy storage, and his electric car company Tesla now has 325,000 pre-orders for the Tesla Model 3, which is good for $14 billion in future revenues.

Meanwhile, in his spare time, Musk draws up plans for revolutionary transport systems, such as the Hyperloop and VTOL supersonic jet aircraft known as the Musk electric jet.

That’s going from zero to one at least a few separate times, with many years in his career left to come. How does Elon do it?

The Life of Elon Musk

In the infographic and article from Funders and Founders, Vital highlights key circumstances, decisions, and results in Elon Musk’s life. Here are some of the key inflection points that helped him to build his massive empire.

Elon was born in South Africa to an engineer father and model mother on June 28, 1971.

Elon read 10 hours a day as a kid, and even read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica.

At age 12, Elon sold his first video game that he coded for $500.

After being inspired by Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Elon decided that his new life mission would be to save humanity.

Leaves Stanford PhD program after two days to help found Zip2, which he started with a $28,000 loan from his father.

He later received proceeds of $22 million from the sale of Zip2 to Compaq, which he used to start X.com.

X.com merges with another online bank (Confinity) to form Paypal.

Elon gets ousted as CEO from Paypal while on his honeymoon, yet still invests more money in the company regardless.

He discovers that space rockets are artificially overpriced, and starts SpaceX to build his own rockets.

Elon gets $250 million from the sale of Paypal to Ebay.

Meets Tesla founders Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard, and introduces them to JB Straubel. Elon invests in Tesla.

After having three SpaceX rockets explode while approaching bankruptcy with Tesla, Elon takes action. He takes over as CEO of Tesla and raises an emergency fifth round of financing. Meanwhile, his fourth rocket launch with SpaceX succeeds and a $1.6B contract with NASA is signed.

Tesla goes public at $17 per share (it trades for ~$250/share today)

Elon announces reusable rockets that could make space flight 100x cheaper, and promises to also send humans to Mars by 2021-2031.

Elon publishes the Hyperloop design, starts building the Gigafactory, unveils the Powerwall, and eventually lands a rocket on an ocean platform.

What’s next?

Launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, starting Gigafactory production, selling the Model 3 electric car, and potentially landing on Mars are just some of the things on his future laundry list.

What Musk can actually accomplish in the future is anybody’s guess. We certainly won’t be betting against him.

AP Inspired by teenage Elon Musk, I spent $2 a day on food for the month of January.

Long before the SpaceX and Tesla CEO accumulated an estimated net worth of $11.7 billion, he challenged himself to survive off $1 a day to see if he had what it takes to be an entrepreneur.

""When I first came to North America — I was in Canada when I was 17 — and just to sort of see what it takes to live, I tried to live on $1 a day, which I was able to do,"" he explained to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in an episode of Tyson's StarTalk Radio podcast.

""I was like, Oh, okay. If I can live for a dollar a day — at least from a food-cost standpoint — it's pretty easy to earn $30 in a month, so I'll probably be okay.""

To replicate the challenge, I adjusted for inflation — $1 in 1988, when Musk was 17, is the equivalent $2 today — and set aside $62 for the 31-day month of January.

After completing what I coined the "" Elon Musk Challenge,"" I reached out to the man himself, asking about any guidelines he set prior to the experiment and letting him know that he inspired my $2-a-day January food budget.

He wrote back in an email:

That's great, although I would not encourage anyone to live on $1 a day. That would not be super fun. Also, I did this back in 1990, so a dollar went a lot further back then. Would be much harder to do that today.

It's nice to hear he doesn't recommend the arduous challenge.

As for his reference to 1990, yes, I caught that. I did the entire month based on the value of a 1988 dollar — and while I was not about to re-do it, I couldn't help but check the value of a 1990 dollar. It's equivalent to $1.81 today, meaning I would have had a budget of $56.11 for the month.

Since I actually came in under budget at $60.93, the difference boils down to a few eggs and sweet potatoes. I have a little food left over post-challenge, so I'm confident the point still stands."

The 46 year old billionaire is such a high profile visionary that you’ve probably heard of him, even if your idea of impressive tech is one of those plastic cassette tapes that lets you play your iPhone 5 through your shitty car’s speaker system.

Musk has long been a meme-able figure, though his interest in America’s technological future wasn’t solidified in a central joke structure before this week. Musk also has a history of quietly fav-ing memes, and meme creators tend to tag him in the hopes that he will descend from his pulpit and toss them a “like”.

It seems Musk memes began popping up when internet users began putting the CEO’s face in place of Drake in the still-popular “Drake Approves” template. Putting a happy-looking Drake next to an image, followed by an unhappy looking Drake next to a similar image is colloquially called “Drakeposting”, and people have been doing it consistently since the Hotline Bling music video first dropped in 2015.

What does Elon like?

First, here are the funniest memes about Musk’s likes and dislikes. You’ll notice that many of these memes are coming from the Instagram account, God-Emperor Musk, which actually shared Inverse’s take on Musk and Game of Thrones when we referenced its meme as part of our theory. The Musk fandom is an ouroboros.

Drake? Nope. Future? Yep.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

There are only 24 hours in every day, and you can’t squeeze out an extra second. Yet some people manage to be so productive and innovative they become billionaires at an age when most of us are still struggling to make ends meet. Even among billionaires, some stand out more than others, capturing the hearts of admirers everywhere.

Elon Musk is arguably one of the most well-liked and respected billionaires today. With Tesla’s recent Model 3 announcement, he continues to stay relevant. Let’s take a look at how Musk has stayed one step ahead of a very elite pack. What habits set him apart from his peers?

1. He reads the way most people watch TV.

Like Buffett, who claims to read around 500 pages a day, Musk is the definition of a bookworm. When he was in grade school, he was reading ten hours a day, devouring everything in his library and the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, and completed a six-month BASIC course in just three days.

Here’s a list of some of his favorite books, just in case you’re interested.

Related: How Reading Books Reduces Stress and Makes You Smarter at the Same Time

2. He doggedly pursues his own interests.

If his healthy reading habits weren’t already a giveaway, Musk is a true believer in self-guided learning. At the age of 12, he used his BASIC skills to program Blastar, a self-made video game which he sold to PC and Office Technology for $500. Musk also doubled majored in physics and economics, then interned for both ultracapacitor research and video game companies.

Today, he’s worth $14.5 billion and runs businesses that seem to have nothing to do with one another. Except they all do, of course -- Musk is genuinely interested in them. It’s no surprise that he’s the main inspiration behind Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man character.

3. He is tirelessly, unflaggingly optimistic.

While the first two traits are true for most successful businesspeople, Musk also has an ace up his sleeve -- he has a strong glass-half-full mentality. His Forbes profile sums this up best by describing two of his companies as “moonshot tech companies.” Except Musk doesn’t think of them as moonshots at all.

The secret to his innovation lies in his enthusiasm. This is a guy who grew up with an emotionally abusive father and was once bullied and beat up so bad that he needed to go to the hospital. “If you wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it’s not.”

Related: Entrepreneurs: Your Irrational Optimism Is Necessary

Musk genuinely believes that what he’s doing is good for the world, and that it’s making a positive difference. In fact, he believes so much in SpaceX that there are two giant posters in his office: before and after scenarios of what Mars will look like once he’s colonized the planet. “I want to die on Mars. Just not on impact.”

4. Yet he still believes failure is an option.

Countless people -- some of them very qualified experts -- told Musk his ideas were ridiculous and bound to fail. Yet Musk managed to ignore them all and do things the way he wanted.

Granted, some of his ideas never quite took off. But many more succeeded and are dazzling investors and consumers alike. “Failure is an option here. If you’re not failing, you’re not innovating enough.” Or, put another way, “There’s a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering.”

5. And he really, really knows how to party.

Businessweek writer Ashlee Vance wrote a book about Musk titled Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and The Quest for a Fantastic Future that revealed some interesting insights into Elon’s private life -- especially how much of a party animal he is.

Here are some of the more fascinating factoids:

He paid for college in Ontario by turning his frat house into a well-run nightclub.

On his 30th birthday celebration, he rented out an English castle for a party of 20 and played hide-and-seek games until 6 am.

He once threw a costume party in Venice (of course) and came dressed as a knight. Then he dueled a mini Darth Vader with a parasol.

Parties aside, Musk also just knows how to have a really good time in general:

After selling his first video game, he started a video game arcade in South Africa as a teenager.

He totaled an uninsured McLaren F1 doing tricks on Sand Hill Road en route to an investor meeting, and ended up hitching a ride instead. The sports car was worth $1 million.

He’s going to build a roller coaster around the SpaceX HQ, just because.

You don’t have to have a PhD to be a pioneer.

Before he sold PayPal and became the multi-billionaire innovator we all admire, Musk decided to give graduate school a shot. He enrolled in a Stanford PhD program -- and dropped out after just two days. That’s all it took for him to realize that there probably wasn’t too much he could learn from the class that he couldn’t learn on his own.

Most of us, if we were fortunate and talented enough to be accepted by a PhD program at Stanford, probably would have attended. Musk didn’t because he already had all the skills he needed to be successful. He was laser-focused on his interests, intensely curious, unflaggingly optimistic, and unafraid to fail.

He is trapped there, waiting for the day when he is forced to race against a giant machine.

I’m a little concerned about him.

I first learned about Gary on April 28, 2017, during a Ted Talk by his overlord, the space explorer and car maker Elon Musk. “We have a pet snail named Gary,” Musk said. “Gary is capable of currently going 14 times faster than a tunnel boring machine. We want to beat Gary. He’s not a patient little fellow, that will be victory. Victory will be beating the snail.”

Gary sounded like a cool dude. He’s probably one of the few—if not the only!—gastropods to become a founding member of a tech company. But even though Gary seems very capable (he can go fast, which is a highly valued skill in Silicon Valley) and relatable (he is impatient, just like me), it seemed that a dark future awaited Gary. Gary got in on the ground floor of some new and exciting innovation, but his CEO would measure success by Gary’s eventual humiliation and defeat. It’s not unheard of for tech companies to pit their employees against each other in the race for success, but this seemed cruel.

So I set out to learn more about Gary’s experience at The Boring Company. What did he think about their labor practices? Was he happy waiting inside the pineapple? What would he do if his shares were about to vest when he finally lost to Godot, the boring machine?

Advertisement

First, I needed to confirm that Gary was real.

Advertisement

Once I knew that, I could find out more about his life inside the Boring Company.

Advertisement

Two weeks later, Musk finally complied, posting a picture of Gary on Twitter and Instagram.

Advertisement

(Can you spot Gary? He’s way up there under the fronds. I think.)

This was exciting because it was my first Gary sighting, but I was also very worried. What if Gary fell down into the boring machine pit and was crushed by Godot? The Boring Company seemed like a very unsafe workplace for Gary.

Advertisement

To find out what he thought about the impending race, I sent an interview request to the Boring Company. But unfortunately, the PR folks over at Big Tunnel didn’t want to grant media access to Gary.

Advertisement

But when pressed, the company said I might get to meet Gary later in the summer.



Advertisement

In June, I tuned into Tesla’s earnings call, hoping for news of Gary. But I was disappointed—Musk never mentioned Gary, and did not respond to a follow-up question about him.

Advertisement

Later that month, I learned that Gary was still going as fast as ever, and that Gary might possibly be female. Unfortunately, another reporter was chasing the story:

Advertisement

July passed with no news from Gary. With summer almost over, I followed up with the Boring Company’s PR team, but got no response. It’d been well over a month without any Gary updates. Was he even still alive?

Advertisement

I decided to let the Boring Company know about my concerns. The spokesperson assured me that Gary was okay, but called him “slow,” which seemed like a red flag. I had always heard Gary described as “fast” and a “speed demon” so maybe the spokesperson was referring to a different snail.

Advertisement

At this point, I alerted some of my coworkers at Gizmodo to the situation.

Advertisement

Bryan agreed to help me with my investigation and sent Musk some direct messages on Twitter.

Advertisement

Musk responded but did not answer our Gary questions.

With the Boring Company stonewalling me, it was time to contact some experts. I spoke to Paul Callomon, the collection manager of malacology, invertebrate paleontology and general invertebrates at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

Advertisement

Callomon told me that Gary might be okay with participating in the race against Godot. “They would of course not know that they were in a race, so that itself would not bother them,” Callomon said. What a relief!

Callomon also told me that the ideal race track for Gary would probably be smooth, rather than the rocky path carved by Godot. “They slide along on a trail of slime. A smooth surface might therefore seem most considerate,” he explained.

Advertisement

However, because the only picture of Gary isn’t very clear, Callomon was not quite sure how fast he might go. Gary might be “some form of US-native pulmonate (air-breathing) snail,” but Callomon couldn’t be certain. “There are at least 20,000 named species of terrestrial mollusk, ranging from the tiny—no more than 2 mm long as adults—to the huge Giant African Snail, which can be a foot long when fully extended. Carnivorous Wolf Snails from Florida can go pretty fast in pursuit of prey—maybe a couple of feet in a minute—but you’d need to trawl the literature to find an exact rate,” he said.

I also tried reaching out to the Boring Company’s PR rep one more time for news of Gary.

I’ll update this story if I hear back.

Reuters

From day one, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company's mission is to transition the world to electric cars.

And now Musk is one step closer to achieving his world-changing vision.

On Friday evening, Tesla launched the Model 3, the company's first ever mass market car and the most important vehicle the company has ever made.

But Musk knows that Tesla, nor its Model 3, will be able to save the world from fossil fuels on its own.

Rather, Musk sees Tesla as a pioneer to pave the way for other carmakers, while also putting pressure on old school automakers to embrace electric cars.

In fact, Tesla actually made all of its technology open source in 2014, so that other car companies can use its tech to build their own electric vehicles.

""Most of the good that Tesla will accomplish is by cutting a path through the jungle to show what can be done with electric cars,"" Musk said in January 2015 during an on-stage interview at the Detroit Auto Show. ""The big impact Tesla will have is the reach to which that we induce other car companies to accelerate their plans for electric vehicles.""

It's been no easy feat, but Tesla took a major step towards clearing that path by beginning production of the Model 3 in July. And from the looks of it, Musk's plan to force a change in the automobile industry is gaining momentum.

A number of car companies — including General Motors, Ford, Volvo, Volkswagen, and Daimler — have all stepped up and announced big plans to ramp up their investments in electric cars.

Tesla's Model 3. Tesla

GM actually beat Tesla to the punch and launched its first long range electric Bolt last year. But the company plans to ramp up its electrified offerings before the end of the decade.

Ford also plans to get serious about electric vehicles with the launch of a long-range, all-electric SUV, which is slated to hit the market in 2020.

Volkswagen plans to invest $10 billion over the next five years to offer 25 electrified cars across all of its brands by 2025. Audi and Porsche, which are owned by Volkswagen, have both revealed all-electric concept cars that are slated to go into production in 2018 and VW plans to begin production of its electric ID car by 2020.

Daimler's Mercedes-Benz also plans to launch an all-electric SUV to take on Tesla by 2019.

Volvo, which is owned by China's Greely Holdings, is taking it even further than its rivals, though, and plans to make all of its new cars either fully electric or hybrid beginning 2019.

Japanese carmakers like Toyota Motor and Honda are also investing heavily in eco-friendly cars, but they are exploring hydrogen powered vehicles, in addition to electric cars powered by rechargeable batteries.

While this kind of growing competition might scare other companies, Musk remains steadfast that it was always part of the plan.

And with the arrival of the Model 3, which secured an estimated 500,000 pre-orders, the pressure is now mounting on the traditional automakers to quicken the pace in bringing their electric cars to market."

On Wednesday, Reuters reported that more than 90% of new Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles have some sort of problem or flaw that needs to be fixed before the vehicles can leave the factory.

Reuters cited unnamed workers and reviews of unconfirmed ""figures from Tesla's internal tracking system as recently as October."" The news agency also reported that ""people told Reuters of seeing problems as far back as 2012.""

That was the year the Model S sedan went into production as the company's first all-Tesla vehicle (the original Tesla Roadster was built in a chassis supplied by Lotus).

Tesla pushed back against the report.

""Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Business Insider. ""Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement.""

The statement went on to point out that Tesla strives to go over its vehicles with a fine-toothed comb, post-production.

""The number of labor hours needed to complete a vehicle has decreased 33% since early 2016,"" Tesla said.

""Of the 250,000 Tesla vehicles ever produced, more than half were built in the past 18 months. Whereas before, it took three shifts with considerable overtime to produce our target annual production of 100,000 Model S and X vehicles, now it can be done with only two shifts and minimal overtime.""

Tesla says customers are very happy

Shares of CEO Elon Musk's all-electric carmaker were trading down over 3% on Wednesday, to $307. The stock has been sliding at the end of 2017 after a huge run-up to nearly $400 earlier.

So what are we to make of the Reuters report?

Not much, and I say this as someone who has made a hobby of studying nearly every Tesla vehicle I spot in the wild for quality control issues, chiefly large gaps between body panels. For the record, I've tested just about every trim level of every vehicle Tesla makes and for the most part, the quality has been quite good. I'm not sure how the cars would fare over the long haul, but Tesla owners seem to be a very happy bunch.

According to Tesla, the company ""has the highest customer satisfaction levels and the highest percentage of customers who say that their next car will be a Tesla in the entire global auto industry.""

It's also worth noting that demand for the Model S and Model X has been solid enough to bring 2017's projected deliveries tally to a record 100,000 vehicles.

Production problems are nothing new

Tesla's factory. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider

Quality does matter on luxury vehicles that sell for $100,000 on average. But Tesla has always been iffy on the nuts and bolts of the business. That hasn't changed with the new Model 3, either, as Tesla is struggling to achieve its ambitious production targets with the car, a $35,000 mass-market effort.

People who want to buy a Tesla just don't care. They're invested enough in the brand — its snazziness and excitement, it transformational nature — to overlook stuff that would offend the owner of a used Honda Civic. But that's the crux of the matter: anybody can buy a Civic, but you have to commit to a vision of a gasoline-free future to buy a Tesla, so you're investing in something more than bulletproof build quality.

Tesla has also always had production challenges. The Model S had 'em in the beginning, as did the Model X and obviously the Model 3 continues this theme.

Tesla disputes quality issues

Tesla does care, however — it knows that the patience of owners can't be taken for granted. The company disputed the 90% figure cited by Reuters, maintaining that vehicles can't leave the factory unless they have no problems whatsoever. So anything that doesn't pass muster is checked out and fixed.

The company also contradicted Reuters' report that flawed vehicles are moved to a separate location for further work.

The Reuters story concerned the Model S and Model X, but as far as the Model 3 problems go, they could be easily solved by Tesla outsourcing some production to an experienced and capable contract manufacturer. But that would undermine the company's narrative of end-to-end control of the vehicle experience. An outside manufacturer also might not want to engage in the extensive examination of vehicles that Tesla says is what leads to smaller issues being caught before a car leaves the factory.

Arguably, the trade-off wouldn't be worth it, although if the Model 3 doesn't hit its mid-2018 targets, Tesla may have to consider this option.

Tesla is trying to get as many electric vehicles on the road as possible, and that master plan could set it up for headaches down the road, as it will likely have to eat the cost of fixing everything that goes wrong with Model 3s once they start rolling in bigger numbers. But it's probably better to have an infinite warranty tacitly in place than to miss a window to put, optimistically, a million EVs on the world's highways by 2020."

""You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and, at times, potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,"" he said.

In October, the company said Tesla owners who wanted to make money from ride-hailing or ride-sharing could do so only on its ride-hailing network and that it would disclose more details about it this year.

Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited $35,000 Model 3 sedan on Friday and deliver the first 30 to employees at the electric-car maker's factory in Fremont, California.

The arrival of a new four-door would ordinarily be a ho-hum event in the auto industry. But the Model 3 is anything but — it's Tesla bid to quintuple sales by 2018 and take them to 1 million by 2020. (Last year, the carmaker didn't even deliver 100,000 cars.)

The Model 3 is also key to vindicating Tesla's market cap of about $50 billion, larger than those of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ford, and, at one time in 2017, General Motors. Since its 2010 initial public offering, Tesla has turned two profitable quarters. The Detroit automakers, meanwhile, have posted steady profits for years and spent the past two raking in cash amid a sales boom in the US powered by SUVs and pickup trucks.

So the Model 3 is a huge deal. And as with any huge deal, there are risks.

Building the car

Tesla has been superb at crafting a high-tech, futuristic story, born of Silicon Valley values and served up by the charismatic CEO Elon Musk, a 21st-century hybrid of Walt Disney, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Howard Hughes (with some Preston Tucker thrown in).

The story has propelled the stock to epic levels.

The more mundane aspects of building cars have been another matter. Both the Model S and Model X were delayed and endured a lot of production problems. Tesla has been around for 13 years, yet the company continues to struggle with fundamentals.

The company could have more than 500,000 preorders for the Model 3. Any other major automaker would have seen that number and kicked a factory into gear, rolling out cars in short order to bring in the cash. GM in 2015 debuted a long-range electric vehicle, priced about the same as the Model 3, and it was sending vehicles to dealerships by late 2016.

The pressure is now on for Tesla, a carmaker that has never wanted to be like anybody else, to hit its marks in this critical, old-school area.

Making money on it

Tesla started by selling $100,000 cars to a well-heeled elite. Even though the Model 3 may be priced closer to $50,000 than $35,000 once it's optioned up, Tesla is still moving in the opposite direction of fat profits. Smaller cars — and mass-market vehicles — make less money than luxury ones.

There's an argument that Tesla makes a healthy margin in the Model S and Model X, but because the company nearly always loses money, that margin is academic at this point. And the Model 3, with its production, engineering, and launch demands, could gobble up much of Tesla's current cash and future operating profits.

So it's vital the vehicle eventually achieves both profitability and volume.

Avoiding a major recall

Tesla has been hit by some notable recalls over the years, but so few of its vehicles are on the road that it hasn't made a huge difference.

Recalls are routine in the car business, but any Tesla recall garners outsize attention. The company has set itself up for a Model 3 recall by skipping a production prototyping stage, which validates the assembly line and ensures production will be smooth and efficient, and going directly to mass production.

The cars could appear in significant numbers by mid-2018 if Tesla's ambitious production ramp is a success. But because of the rush, the recall watch will be on from the get-go.

Bucking a market trend

Nobody else in the car business is launching a new sedan. The market in the US has shifted to SUVs and crossovers, so automakers are furiously expanding that aspect of their offerings.

As with the Model S, a four-door that came out before the Model X SUV, Tesla is launching the Model 3 sedan ahead of the Model Y crossover, a vehicle that might not show up until 2020 or later.

Tesla's preorders suggest there's plenty of demand for the Model 3 — but the risk there is that we could be talking about Tesla demand, rather than vehicle demand.

Staying ahead of the competition

The Porsche Mission E. Porsche

Following on that point, Tesla has thus far enjoyed a great deal of Tesla demand — people want its cars because they want to be part of its story.

But Tesla has also had the all-electric market pretty much to itself. For 13 years. And it hasn't been able to make money, as EVs amount to only about 1% of global sales. The bigger carmakers have been happy to let Tesla take on all the risk, only now are they starting to bring out competitive vehicles, and as GM demonstrated with the Bolt, they can roll out such a car in short order.

Musk is happy about this — he never wanted to go it alone, and he's playing a long game called ""save the planet."" But the era of Tesla watching is now over; the era of Tesla beating has begun.

Sustaining the momentum

The Model X. Tesla

As exciting as the Model 3 arrival is, it's only Tesla's third car. If you want to buy a Tesla, you don't suffer from an abundance of choice, and the expected debut in September of a semitruck design isn't likely to help. Tesla somewhat solves this problem by offering different battery configurations, rear-wheel and all-wheel-drive variants, and juicier levels of performance.

But segmentation is a challenge. A Ford, GM, Toyota, or Honda will sell you one of a half-dozen crossovers, from diminutive to quite large, with lengthy options lists and varying levels of luxury, from bare bones to high-end.

So Tesla needs to add to the Model 3 lineup, and fast. Tesla also needs to avoid relying on refreshing aging platforms. The Model S is getting long in the tooth, and while over-the-air software updates might add capabilities, a redesigned vehicle has to come someday. That day will also come for the Model X and the Model 3.

All eyes will be on Tesla this week as the Model 3 gets real. But when it comes to the risks, the real work has just begun."

Tesla’s stock closed down slightly Monday after news that it fired “hundreds of workers” in recent days as a result of annual performance reviews.

While the firings come as the company is experiencing significant production delays affecting the Model 3, Tesla said the dismissals — which involved hundreds of employees, according to some reports — were unrelated to those delays and would have no effect on the vehicle’s continued rollout.

[‘We understand what needs to be fixed,’ Tesla says after missing Model 3 production goals]

In a statement emailed to The Washington Post, the company said a similar number of “employee departures” occurred last year. The company also noted that the firings involved mostly nonmanufacturing positions and that some employees were given bonuses and promotions after this year’s review.

“Like all companies, Tesla conducts an annual performance review during which a manager and employee discuss the results that were achieved, as well as how those results were achieved, during the performance period,” the statement said.

“As with any company, especially one of over 33,000 employees, performance reviews also occasionally result in employee departures,” the statement added. “Tesla is continuing to grow and hire new employees around the world.”

The company declined to confirm how many employees had been let go but said it plans to backfill the vast majority of the openings.

The San Jose Mercury News, which first reported the firings, said the departures included “engineers, managers and factory workers.” Employees told the paper that they received “little or no warnings” before the firings, which reportedly targeted 400 to 700 employees, leading to “lowered morale through many departments.”

Juan Maldonado, a production worker, told the paper that he was fired last week after close to four years at Tesla. The 48-year-old speculated that his dismissal was the result of being late to work on two occasions in recent months.

“I’m going to try to find a job,” he said.

[I spent three minutes inside Tesla’s Model 3 — and I’m still thinking about it a day later]

The firings come during an important period for the company that chief executive Elon Musk has characterized as “production hell.” That production surrounds the Model 3, the company’s first mass-market vehicle, for which Musk has set an aggressive production schedule — one the company has not kept pace with.

Musk’s original goal was for Tesla to produce 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter, a sizable jump en route to increasing production to 20,000 vehicles per month by the end of the year and 50,000 a month by the end of next year.

But the company said earlier this month that it had produced only 260 of the 1,500 intended sedans during that period, blaming production issues.

“Model 3 production was less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks,” Tesla wrote in an Oct. 2 investor letter. “Although the vast majority of manufacturing subsystems at both our California car plant and our Nevada Gigafactory are able to operate at a high rate, a handful have taken longer to activate than expected.”

The company noted that there are “no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain” and said that company officials understand “what needs to be fixed.”

Tesla’s stock closed down 1.4 percent to $350.60 on Monday.

The Tesla Model 3 is the most hotly anticipated car in the history of the auto industry. After it was revealed in March 2016, Tesla booked a massive and unprecedented number of pre-orders, now something on the order of 500,000.

The Model 3 had also been planned since the early days of the company. The strategy was to build a sexy, expensive electric sports car, use the money to launch sexy, expensive luxury vehicles, and then attack the mass market and further the ultimate objective of CEO Elon Musk: accelerate the end of fossil fuels and usher in an age of sustainable, electric transportation.

The Model 3 launched in July, but its rollout has been a mess. Musk calls it ""production hell,"" but it is really more dire than that. After the company reported its worst-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday, it confirmed that the major bottlenecks with the vehicle are at the Gigafactory, a giant battery plant in Nevada. Musk is spending a lot of time there. Tesla's main product guy, JB Straubel evidently now calls the Gigafactory home.

An alarming problem

The problem is alarming — a bigger concern than if Tesla were having trouble assembling the Model 3 at its factory in Fremont or had some issues with the normal supply chain. That's because the problem stems from Tesla's only significant point of true expertise in the auto industry: battery production.

""The primary production constraint really, by far, is in battery module assembly,"" Musk said on a conference call with analysts after earnings were announced, confirming earlier reports.

""[W]e had a subcontractor, a systems integration subcontractor, that unfortunately really dropped the ball, and we did not realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and this is a very complex manufacturing area,"" he added. ""We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch, and redo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone two of module production.""

Tesla's Achilles' heel has always been its inability to build cars as effectively as the Toyotas and General Motors of the world, but for its two luxury vehicles, the Model S and Model X, that's been largely overcome and Tesla's ""core"" business is on track to deliver 100,000 cars in 2017 and an impressive 250,000 over the life of the company.

Skeptics anticipated that Tesla would have a tough time ramping up Model 3 production, given the large number of pre-orders, Tesla's history, and the difficulty of launching an all-new vehicle priced much lower than Tesla's current offerings.

But few thought that Tesla would have battery challenges.

Batteries are fundamental

Tesla is basically great at building batteries. The design is unusual: thousands of laptop cells wired together and managed by software. But the system works and works well; when the original Roadster, Tesla's first vehicle, hit the streets a decade ago, it was the only electric car that could serve up the kind of range that gas-powered vehicles delivered.

And the battery story has only gotten better. Tesla is now getting 335 miles of range out of its largest battery pack, a 100 kilowatt-hour unit. Tesla's Model S P100D in ""Ludicrous Mode"" is so good at drawing power from this pack and sending it to the wheels that it can outrun every supercar in the world. Tesla is also taking batteries out of the cars and using them for energy storage, most recently in Puerto Rico following a devastating hurricane that knocked out electricity for much of the island.

Prior to the company's brush with bankruptcy back in 2008, the battery story was only thing Tesla had going for it. Coupled the carmaker's electric powertrains, this aspect of the business was profitable, long before Tesla was selling $100,000 luxury sedans with a 20% gross margin.

We're gonna need a lot of batteries

Despite the problems with the Model 3, Tesla Model X SUV is now a big success. Tesla

The simple explanation for production hell at the Gigafactory is that because Tesla needs so many packs to build 500,000 Model 3s, it has to radically accelerate battery assembly and is trying to automate as much of the process as possible. In that sense, the company can be forgiven for not getting it right — it could have pursued business as usual and rolled a few thousand 3s per week soon after launch, but instead, it planned for a future when monthly production would rise to 20,000 units.

The fix-it-on-the-fly approach is consistent with how the company operates, but it doesn't make sense on the battery front. Admittedly, the Gigafactory is itself a work-in-progress. But Tesla had been aiming for 20,000-unit-production by December for some time. Assembling enough battery packs to hit that mark was a fundamental that we assumed the company would get right.

The bottom line is that it's baffling Tesla didn't."

Matthew DeBord/Business Insider It's easy to think of Tesla a car company because, of course, it makes cars. That's what you see when you spot a Tesla on the road.

But that whole car-on-the-outside thing can be deceiving. In fact, although Porsche 911s certainly look cool, the ""killer app"" of the legendary sports car is actually the engine, the famous flat six.

Tesla's are no different. Exterior-wise, the Model S is a sleek sedan, and the Model X is an equally sleek SUV, with exotic ""falcon wing"" doors.

But it's what's inside that counts. Seriously — Tesla wouldn't the $40-billion market cap electric carmaker we know today if it hadn't taken the plunge on an offbeat battery-and-drivetrain design a decade ago.

Tesla's batteries are made up of about 8,000 lithium-ion cells wired together and yoked to the software and cooling systems necessary to keep them humming as they pipe as much as 100 kWh of juice to one or two electric motors. This was, initially, a sort of quick-and-dirty way of taking off-the-shelf laptop-style cells and putting enough of them together to delivery performance and range.

Other companies might have favored a more monolithic design, but Tesla did have time to do that.

Other the years, that decision has been vindicated. Tesla has a unique design for its batteries, but it works. And it worked so well that it might be the most valuable part of the company.

Value inside

This week, Oppenheimer analysts Colin Rusch published a research note, generally supportive to Tesla's prospects, in which he highlighted the value of the stuff that makes Teslas go.

""We believe Tesla's battery pack and drivetrain IP represents substantial value for the company given that it has produced a significant volume of vehicles,"" he wrote.""We also believe it is possible to quantify the business and its potential impact based on penetration rates. We believe this business could be worth $15-20 [billion] by 2022.""

Rusch's point about drivetrain value isn't new. Back in 2008, when Tesla was struggling and lurching toward a narrow avoidance of bankruptcy, it realized the value of its drivetrain technology and sought to share it with investment partners. This was before the Model S arrived, so Tesla was looking for ways to monetize whatever it could.

This led to powertrain deals with both Daimler (Mercedes parent) and Toyota (both Daimler and Toyota has since sold their stakes).

The Tesla Model S. William Wei, Business Insider

Back then, having untapped value in the drivetrain was extremely useful. Now that Tesla is riding much higher financial, however, the lucrative drivetrain IP that Rusch discusses could be dangerous.

Tesla has already open-sourced all its patents, so that's not the issue. The risk is that Tesla isn't just a car company anymore; it's a vertically integrated energy firm. A conglomerate, with auto, solar, battery manufacturing, and energy storage businesses.

In fact, the brutally capital-intensive nature of the car business could come day induce Tesla to start thinking about offloading some of its own assets at some point. And anyone wanting to catch up quickly in the electric-car space could cast a covetous eye on Tesla's tech.

We're a long way from that happening, but it's worth remembering that Tesla has tapped the ""heart"" of its vehicles before, and could do so again."

The month, the day, the hour Tesla CEO Elon Musk started shipping Tesla Model 3 to the first of a reported 373,000 customers and, perhaps, changed the course of electric vehicles forever?

We might.

“I don’t think there’s any question that this is their most important launch,” said electric vehicle pioneer and consultant Chelsea Sexton.

Sexton, who was part of GM’s ill-fated EV1 team and has worked in and around the electric vehicle (EV) industry for 20 years and admits to having “layers and layers of EV experience” agrees, like most people I spoke to, that Tesla is no ordinary car company. With its aspirational and coveted products and iconic (and somewhat irascible) leader, it’s the “Apple” of the automotive industry.

“They are like Apple in the sense that they have disrupted the auto industry and forced them faster to move to electronic vehicles,” said Tim Bajarian, a tech industry analyst, who owns the consulting firm Creative Strategies.

When Musk and Tesla start delivering Tesla Model 3’s to pre-order customers later this month, it will mark a turning point for the company. While the new 4-door sedan looks like the luxury sedan Model S, it represents a departure and a clear effort to move down market.

While the Tesla Model S starts at around $72,000 and, with upgrade packages that include the Ludicrous speed boost, a bigger battery for a range of more than 300 miles, and autonomous driving features, most Model S EVs sell for $100,000 or more.

Two out of the three Tesla’s I wrote about in a special series on Tesla Model S drivers, sold for north of $110,00.

The Tesla Model 3 starts at $35,000 and could cost consumers less than $30,000 after tax incentives of up to $7,500.

For that mass-market price, Model 3 buyers accept a more limited driving range of 215 miles per charge and 0-to-60 mph in 6 seconds, as opposed to the body-jolting 3.1 seconds. (Support for autopilot hardware, fast-charging super charging stations, 5-star safety features and seating for five are still included).

It’s unlikely Model 3 customers will notice these small deficits. It’s probably important they don’t.

New EV customers

“This is Tesla’s first and potentially last opportunity to take them out of the purely luxury- and rich person car segment.” said Sexton who knows Musk and has consulted for Tesla (her husband worked for Tesla for 5 years) and virtually every other automotive manufacturer on EV technologies.

Musk’s Model 3, however, enters a crowded field.

There are at least six similarly priced EV vehicles from Ford (Focus Electric), GM (Chevy Bolt EV), Kia Soul EV), BMW (i3), Mercedes (B-Class), and Nissan (Leaf).

Few match the Model 3’s range, but some come close. In fact, the more I looked at the current mid-range EV field, the more I wondered why Tesla’s Model 3 would mark a substantial EV market shift.

These cars all look good and are full featured. It’s true none could match the Model 3’s autonomous driving capabilities, but these are otherwise excellent EV choices.

“The main thing challenging the EV market at the moment is lack of product,” Sexton told me. She explained that, even with an EV car from virtually every major car company, they are incredibly limited in price range, performance and, especially, style options. It’s simply not how people are used to buying cars.

'This is Tesla’s first and potentially last opportunity to take them out of the purely luxury- and rich person car segment.'

The other issue, and it may be the biggest one, is availability. Some of these EV cars, like the Kia Soul EV, are only sold in California. According to a 2015 study, California currently accounts for 40% of the EV market.

Why California? It’s one of the few states that has an active mandate to put zero-emissions cars on the road, 1.5 million by 2025. By 2018, 10 states could have similar rules on the books.

That doesn’t entirely explain why the limited EV options from major auto manufacturers sometimes feels like lip service.

What does, though, is CAFE or Corporate Average Fuel Economy. This Federal mandate requires an auto manufacturer’s fleet (encompassing all makes and models) has an average fuel economy of 55 mpg by 2025 (President Donald Trump is seeking to roll back these standards). Having an all- electric, long-range, zero-emissions car in the fleet immediately helps balance out trucks and SUVs.

“The vast majority [of these EVs] are ‘compliance cars,’” said Sexton. She contends that auto companies aren’t interested in selling these EVs at volume, just enough of them “to get the carbon credits they need.”

Tesla sells only electric vehicles, so that’s clearly not part of its go-to-market strategy, and the Tesla Model 3 is being sold nationally, two factors that instantly set the Model 3 apart from the competition.

And, of course, there is that undeniable cachet.

That certain something

Every single Elon Musk tweet is analyzed for its significance, especially as it relates to Tesla, current model capabilities and future options. His tweet of the first production Model 3 rolling off the assembly line collected 42,113 retweets and 148,943 likes.

Tesla’s forums are full of die-hard fans discussing the minutiae of the Model 3 and agonizing over delivery dates. Most have already ordered and many are concerned that they won’t see a car until 2018 (which is likely). The first batch of 325,000 Model 3s won't roll off the assembly line at once. It will take months to deliver them all.

“I ordered the Model 3 the day they were available. As an existing Tesla owner, I believe we are pushed to the front of the queue, but we'll see how it all works out,” DragTimes Editor Brooks Weisblat told me via email.

Weisblat and I met a couple of years ago when he was racing Tesla Model S P85Ds. A longtime Tesla fan, he wondered why Tesla was waiting to release the car’s detailed specs, but is fine waiting to learn more until after the launch event later this month.

“I plan to drive the 3 for a while and decide to either keep it, or if I like my Model S better, I will hand the Model 3 over to my Dad who currently drives a BMW i3,” he wrote.

Weisblat seemed comfortable rolling with whatever punches Tesla delivers along the Model 3 production route, but Sexton believes the company may not be so lucky as its more affordable EV opens the floodgates to a new kind of Tesla customer.

“[The Tesla Model 3] takes them out of that camp of people who are simply super fans to ones that will not tolerate things that have happened on recent products,” she said, pointing to recent quality issues with the Model X.

Even though Tesla’s hundreds of thousands of waiting Model 3 customers will want their cars now, Sexton counsels a slow and steady approach for the company. “It would be best to go slow and make sure first customers have a good experience with the product,” she told me.

Plus, if things go sideways for Tesla – quality issues, a scramble to recover, inconsistent delivery and dwindling revenue stream – it could rock the company. Tesla may be worth more than Ford and GM, but it probably doesn’t have the cash cushion to sustain losses the way, say, a GM does with the low-selling Bolt.

The Tesla Model 3 is 'an aspirational example of EVs'

There are, obviously, other risk factors that could sap the momentum out of Tesla’s drive to transform the EV industry. All those Model 3 cars are going to need a lot of fresh batteries. Musk built his own battery manufacturing plant in Nevada, the aptly-named Gigafactory, but it’s not at full capacity. It started making Powerwall home batteries and only recently began producing batteries for the Model 3. That should change by 2018, when the Gigafactory expects to produce enough batteries to supply cells for at least a half a million EVs.

Sexton sees the economies of scale inherent in owning your own battery factory, but has a concern.

“They need to make sure that plant remains flexible as new technologies come down the line,” she said and pointed to Nissan, which recently abandoned its own EV battery manufacturing facilities in favor or newer technology from LG.

What is more likely, though, is that, as the Model 3 does arrive in customers' hands around the country, the EVs generate an intense feeling of FOMO for consumers and car enthusiasts.

Sexton noted that the Tesla Model 3 is “an aspirational example of EVs” and has a cache that the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt simply do not share.

If Tesla can keep up with demand, the Model 3 will mark the end of its EV boutique existence. The car has the potential to create an iPhone-like buzz in the auto market and industry. Its appearance on the road will excite other drivers and its entrance into the market should be cause for concern among other industry players.

“I do see the Tesla Model 3 being a tipping point that will make them more competitive,” Bajarin, the analyst, said, “especially in the mid-price range, but it will also serve as a way to get the major auto dealers to provide similar models and designs to stay competitive themselves.”"

Officials have said it could take weeks to restore power to just a quarter of the island’s households while some families could be left without electricity for up to six months.

Musk's solar lifeline to Puerto Rico could prove effective for the island which, according to CNN, imports and burns oil to generate electricity, but it would be a long term resolution and not an immediate solution to restoring power to the island."

Yes, Tesla",2017-02-07 00:00:00,2019-06-25 15:35:28.341412,Peter Valdes-Dapena,"The Tesla Model S can go from zero to 60 faster than any other street-legal car around. That includes Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bugattis and any other crazy exotic sports car you can think of.

The Tesla Model S P100D, with 760 horsepower and all-wheel-drive, jumped from a dead stop to 60 miles an hour in 2.28 seconds in a test by Motor Trend. It's the first car to ever do that in under 2.3 seconds in the magazine's testing. With this sort of power, merging into the traffic on the highway is less of an issue than trying not to rear-end anyone while you're doing it.

That's quicker than high-priced hybrid supercars like the $1.5 million Ferrari LaFerrari, the $1.1 McLaren P1 or the $845,000 Porsche 918 Spyder.

For comparison, the Tesla Model S P100D costs about about $135,000. Also, those cars have just two seats each and barely any luggage space. The Tesla Model S, on other hand, has two spacious trunks and can seat up to seven, including two small children facing rearward.

The Model S is also a fairly heavy car, but in this case that helps. The Tesla's nearly 5,000 pound weight, not including occupants, helps its tires grip the road, said Motor Trend writer Frank Markus. Given all the power that's pushed out by the electric motors, the wheels would just spin if it weren't for all that weight pushing the tires down onto the asphalt, he said.

Motor Trend ran its test using the car's ""Ludicrous Easter Egg"" mode, which provides even more acceleration than ""regular"" Ludicrous mode. In this mode, the car's battery temperature is raised slightly and the air conditioning is used to cool the motors. Once everything is ready, the driver uses a special ""launch control"" sequence of brake and accelerator pedal pushes to initiate the crushing ground-level blast-off.

The Tesla's 0-60 blast is a fairly limited trick, though. Its acceleration tapers off past 60. Other cars -- like the Ferrari, McLaren and Porsche -- can hit 70 and 80 miles an hour faster than the Tesla.

The Tesla would also lose to those cars at the drag strip. The Model S can run a quarter mile in 10.5 seconds reaching 125 miles an hour by the end, Markus said. But the Ferrari LaFerrari is still the fastest quarter-mile car the magazine has ever tested, making the run in 9.7 seconds and reaching 148.5 miles an hour."

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are mostly lower in early trading Monday, the first day of trading in the second quarter. Tesla is rising after it disclosed a jump in quarterly deliveries, but other car makers are slipping after reporting March sales figures that disappointed investors. Banks and energy companies are trading lower as well. Gains for insurance companies are leading health care stocks higher.

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,358 as of 10:20 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,638. The Nasdaq composite shed 2 points to 5,909. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gave up 7 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,378.

HONK IF YOU'RE SELLING: Auto sales have reached all-time highs in recent years and they're expected to rise in March as well, but analysts fear they've plateaued and will start slowing down soon. That hurt car makers and parts suppliers on Monday.

Ford's sales slumped 7.5 percent as sales of SUVs slipped and car sales plunged because of some big fleet sales the company reported a year ago. Fiat Chrysler said its totals sales declined 5 percent. Ford gave up 27 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $11.37 and Fiat Chrysler lost 38 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $10.55. General Motors said its sales grew 2 percent, but that didn't excite investors. Its stock fell $1.08, or 3.1 percent, to $34.28.

Tesla said over the weekend that its deliveries jumped 69 percent in the first quarter to a record 25,000. The electric car company's stock climbed $13.98, or 5 percent, to $292.28.

Auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive dropped $12.31, or 4.6 percent, to $257.53 and AutoZone and $18.98, or 2.6 percent, to $704.07."

Tesla Motors has made that feeling reality with its Autopilot technology. Drivers have racked up more than 130 million miles with Tesla's Autopilot feature engaged, according to the corporation.

The manufacturer of sleek, fast, high-end electric cars has not cornered the market on driverless autos: In California, the low-speed, self-driving Google Car has been on the road for nearly two years; and conventional automakers are exploring partnerships with tech companies to develop a range of driving improvements.

Like other technological advances — rear-view cameras, auto-braking and blind-spot monitors — self-driving equipment has the potential to make roads, drivers and passengers safer. In light of common behaviors on the roads these days — with drivers tailgating, speeding, texting, posting to social media accounts or videoing themselves — self-driving cars and small trucks have significant appeal.

Yet self-driving autos remain an emerging development, one that would radically change the relationship between car and driver. Plus, despite the amazing advances in technology, systems are not flawless.

For instance, it was recently disclosed that in May, a Tesla vehicle in the Autopilot option crashed into an 18-wheel tractor-trailer that turned in front of the car; the system failed to apply the brakes. The crash occurred in Levy County, Fla.; the 40-year-old man behind the wheel was killed in the first reported fatality involving the self-driving technology. A relatively small number of other wrecks involving Autopilot have also been reported. (In February, a Google-modified, self-driving Lexus RX drove into a public-transit bus in California.)

Following the fatal crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated the crash and opened a probe into whether the Autopilot feature has systemic problems. Tesla officials have maintained that the system is safe.

The problem is, under current laws and rules, the NHTSA had to wait for a crash in order to investigate.

What's more, as researchers from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute wrote in the July 7 New York Times, the U.S. Department of Transportation only investigates when a problem is detected in automobile technology. ""Self-driving cars (or vehicles in a self-driving mode like the Tesla) aren't required to pass any special tests before they go on the roads. Like any other new automobile feature, autonomous driving is tested by the manufacturer, which gives assurances that the technology meets applicable laws and safety standards,"" stated Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle.

The researchers called for standardized, comprehensive tests for driverless technology and the establishment of a ""graduated license system"" that makes clear what situations the vehicles can safely negotiate. The NHTSA should lead the effort to define the requirements for testing, they added.

Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, has proposed that the NHTSA develop policy and safety standards with input from the public as well as industry officials; the administration is expected to issue recommendations this summer regarding testing of technology on public roads.

Another concern is that, at this point and most likely into the near future, humans must at times be prepared to take control of a vehicle in self-driving mode. Research at Virginia Tech University suggests that, for various reasons, many drivers are not able or capable of assuming control quickly enough; clearly, driver training and education will need to change.

The technologies available and the advances on the horizon have the potential to revolutionize auto travel. Regulations and testing should weigh the value of innovation against the need to ensure that technology delivers the safety promised by manufacturers.

An idea, even in its root meaning, is “to see.” Da Vinci, Einstein, Edison, the Wright brothers, Tesla, Bell, Borlaug and Fleming — they had the ability to see what others could not. Because they opened their eyes to possibilities and thrived in pursuit of them, we have light. We have abundant food. We can even fly. Ideas change everything. The transformative power of ideas will be the focus of ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference 2018. Join us to explore how ideas can germinate into innovations that change the course of our businesses and lives.

The annual Alltech symposium, which draws 5,000 people to Lexington each May, is the brain child of Irish entrepreneur and scientist Dr. Pearse Lyons, founder of Alltech. Founded in 1980 with just $10,000 and a dream, Alltech now has more than 100 manufacturing sites globally and is a leading producer and processor of yeast and organic trace minerals. “If I can do, rest assured, you can do it,” say Dr. Lyons. “And that’s the message of ONE.”

I strapped them all onto my fleshy wrist: the Fitbits, the Nikes, the Polars. I’ve watched circles fill up on my Apple Watch and I’ve watched ghost competitors race me on early GPS watches. But for the past few months I abandoned any wrist-based tracker because the battery in the one I was using kept dying. And so I went pedometer-less for a long while.

Now, thankfully, I can walk again thanks to the vivofit 3. Garmin’s super-simple band has a 1-year battery life, is eminently usable and is as unobtrusive as any other fitness tracker — without the requirement to carry a charger around on long trips. In short, it’s fitness tracking epitomized.

The device is exactly what you’d expect from a fitness tracker. It has a single button that scrolls between time, date, steps taken, your daily goal, calorie burn, distance moved and “active time.” It also senses when you’re asleep, automatically, and charts your deep sleep with acceptable accuracy. It connects to Garmin’s own Connect app to show you your stats and you can sync with a heart-rate monitor and phone wirelessly. Finally, you can hold down the button to time activities as needed.

The device tracks your motion and reminds you to stand up every hour or so. You can see all of your activity on the Garmin Connect app, which also connects to other Garmin devices, like bike computers and higher-end sports watches. You can swap out the bands for fancy designer models, but I liked the black band just fine.

[gallery ids=""1322955,1322956,1322957""]

What this means is that this little $99 band does everything you need it to do for the average life of futzing around at work and home. This is definitely not for the triathlon-runner or the endurance athlete — the lack of a built-in heart-rate sensor means you won’t be truly satisfied — but as a daily driver, a sort of fun thing to track your steps and tell you that you’re too slovenly, then this is just right.

It’s obvious that Garmin is going straight for the Fitbit jugular. Late for the activity tracker party, the company originally tried to sell all sorts of high-end sports devices to compete with Android and Apple when the only folks it needed to compete with are the ones selling sub-$100 activity trackers. It’s not clear how many of the vivofits Garmin has sold, but given that this is the third iteration on the theme — the first two devices sporting a simpler LCD screen and fewer features — they clearly think this product has legs. And it does.

Again, this is not Garmin’s “premium” product. It is a great entry-level fitness tracker with enough features to keep you happy until you run a 10K and need something a little more in-depth. When that becomes the case, a heart-rate measuring device like the Forerunner or the vivoactive HR will do quite nicely. The vivofit 3, then, is Garmin’s gateway drug.

There are a few concerns I had with this product. First, there is no backlight, so you can’t consult it in the dark. Second, the clasp and rubber are precariously connected. I’ve seen the device fall off a few times during normal use, even when the buckle is properly locked. It’s not a terrible flaw, but it could be slightly disconcerting if you’re running around and suddenly find your band gone. Neither of these are showstoppers yet.

The vivofit 3 works well. It measures your walks and runs and it can measure your sleep. It reminds you to move and it rewards you when you do. In a society predicated toward sloth and sitting, it’s a boon friend and wrist companion, and at $99 it’s a great way to suggest someone should get out more without untoward chiding. Heck, buy it for yourself and let it help you get off the couch. It’s a win for all, especially fleshy meat bags like myself."

But don't trust it to keep you out of an accident, AAA says.

Automatic braking systems use cameras and sensors to slow or stop a car if there is a stopped vehicle another obstacle ahead.

But not all of these systems are created equal, according to a AAA study which found some far more effective than others. Some automatic braking systems are designed to to slow a car down, which won't necessarily prevent an accident. And even the systems designed to bring a car to a full stop stop a don't always prevent a collision.

Most automakers have agreed to make automatic braking standard by the 2022 model year. About 10% of new vehicles currently have automatic braking as standard equipment, and more than half offer it as an option.

And many car buyers want the feature on their next new car, according to a AAA survey. The problem: Two-thirds of them believe that an automatic braking system will stop the car without any help from the driver, said AAA, but that simply isn't true.

""It's an excellent technology and if I was shopping for a vehicle today, it's one I would look for,"" said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering AAA. ""That said, there's a big gap between consumer understanding of the systems and the system's performance.""

Automatic braking is one of the stepping stones to the true self driving cars that are now being developed. But the safety of self-driving cars has been under fire since a driver using the Tesla ""Autopilot"" feature was killed in May when a truck pulled in front of him.

Bannon said it's important that drivers understand that even the best automatic braking systems will only avoid a crash 40% of the time if a car is traveling at 45 mph.

Related: Cheap gas helps surge surge in traffic deaths

But even if there is a crash, slowing a car down is still important. If a car traveling 30 mph can be slowed to just 20 mph before impact that eliminates about 50% of the energy from an accident.

""You need to keep your hands on the wheel and foot on the brake,"" he said. ""Drive like you don't have it, and it'll be a nice safety net for you.""

AAA does not release the results of its tests of specific automatic braking systems."

Doug Began His Career In At The Car Stereo Trade Publication Mobile Electronics + Before Serving As Editor Of The Leading Consume...,"Despite disparate monikers like Lexus Advanced Pre-Collision System, Volvo City Safety, and Mercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Pre-Safe Brake, all these systems essentially do the same thing: Automatically apply a car's brakes to help stop when a frontal collision is eminent.

Ford's Forward Collision Warning with Brake Support, Honda's Collision Mitigation Brake System, and Mitsubishi's Forward Collision Mitigation can also detect a collision ahead and apply the brakes, but only to slow a vehicle, not stop it completely.

Collision prevention systems and collision mitigation systems obviously have similar but vastly diverse capabilities—and knowing these could literally mean the difference between life and death in a crash.

While I test dozens of vehicles each year for PCMag.com and note which cars have certain driver assists, I don't risk life and limb evaluating crash-prevention features (but I do point out when they are annoying with too many false alarms or underperform).

AAA recently tested dozens of systems ""using instrumented vehicles and a state-of the-art robotic 'soft car' that allowed for collisions without vehicle damage."" During the tests, AAA collected data on speed, deceleration, and the gap between vehicles in a variety of collision scenarios ""designed to mirror real-world driving conditions."" And the results weren't surprising.

AAA found that crash prevention systems designed to bring a vehicle to a halt in an accident reduced speeds by almost double compared to crash mitigation system that only slow a car before a collision. And while AAA noted that every crash-prevention system it tested offers ""significant safety benefit to drivers"" by reducing the potentially fatal force experienced by occupants during a collision, it ""warns that automatic braking systems are not all designed to prevent collisions and urges consumers to fully understand system limitations before getting behind the wheel.""

Alphabet Soup of Driver Assists

AAA also noted that consumers are understandably confused by the disparities between these two comparable technologies. It obviously doesn't help that systems that do the same thing go by different names—or that automakers further complicate matters by using an alphabet soup of acronyms such as Lexus PCS, Honda CMBS, and Mitsubishi FCM.

John Nielsen, AAA's managing director of Automotive Engineering and Repair, said in a statement that ""when shopping for a new vehicle, AAA recommends considering one equipped with an automatic emergency braking system. However, with the proliferation of vehicle technology, it's more important than ever for drivers to fully understand their vehicle's capabilities and limitations before driving off the dealer lot.""

It would help if automakers could use a generic name for these systems. There's precedent for this such as ABS (anti-lock braking system) and TMPS (tire-pressure monitoring systems). The good news is that collision-prevention systems have become part of the federal government's crash test rating system.

Even better news is that earlier this year, 20 automakers representing more than 99 percent of vehicles sold in the US agreed to voluntarily add automatic emergency braking (AEB) as a standard feature by 2022—and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has adopted AEB as an acronym of choice.

The bad news is that, in the meantime, car shoppers and owners have to dig a little deeper to understand the capabilities of crash-prevention systems in vehicles. ""Drivers should not rely on advertisements alone to gauge how well a system will perform in the real world,"" Greg Brannon, AAA's director of Automotive Engineering, told me. ""The vehicle's owner's manual is the only place to find a system's true capabilities, and more importantly, its limitations.""

You certainly don't want to learn about them in or after a crash."

Woodland, like so many agricultural towns in California’s Central Valley has a large population of Latinos — nearly 50 percent of 56,500 — and an abundance of restaurants reflecting that demographic. Many of the restaurants are family-owned and prepare foods from the state or region the family came from, such as Jalisco, Nayarit and Guanajuato; and more than a few use family recipes.

A drive down Main Street and one block over on Court Street will show you at least a dozen places to choose from, and venturing a bit farther out onto East Street, Gibson and Sixth Street will expand the number to nearly 20. They range from grab-and-go taquerias to sit-down restaurants with full-service bars and occasional entertainment.

Residents here have a real affection for their Mexican restaurants. “Having been raised near Woodland, and having lived here as an adult for over 20 years, I think that I have taken for granted all of the great Mexican restaurants in Woodland,” says Mary Kimball. “There’s something for everybody.”

Look for big bowls of home-style pozole and menudo on the weekends and seafood specialties, especially from Nayarit- and Jalisco-style restaurants. Choices of fillings or toppings for tortas, burritos and tacos range from carnitas to lengua (tongue) barbacoa and al pastor (spicy marinated pork in sauce), and, in at least once instance, nopales.

Here are some local favorites:

Quetzal

On Main Street, backing onto the large parking lot for Woodland’s outstanding El Superior supermarket is the small, cheerful Quetzal, which features homemade gorditos and sopes as well as traditional tacos, burritos, tostadas and platillos with rice and beans. The owners are from near San Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato state in the middle of Mexico. Try the nopales gordito, a hand-held pocket sandwich of fried dough, slit open and stuffed with grilled nopales (cactus) and onions, and topped off with shredded lettuce, guacamole, and crumbly cheese, or a sope, fried flat bread, with a saucy topping like al pastor, plus lettuce, tomato and crumbled cheese.

El Charro Restaurant

One of the most popular places with locals, especially for dinner and on weekends, is El Charro Restaurant and Bar, on Woodland’s main street. There is often a crowd, both around the full-service bar and in the large adjacent dining room — singles, couples, groups and families. The atmosphere is festive old Mexico, with classic rawhide chairs and tall, exposed brick walls dating from the 1800s, giving the place a rustic elegance. The owner, Olga Ruelas, is originally from Jalisco state, just inland from the coastal state of Nayarit, and runs the restaurant with her son, Reuben. They both can be seen on most days, working. “I’m also the one who goes to Mexico and brings back the terracotta jars for serving the cantaritos,” he says of the deceptively easy-to-drink combination of Tequila (your choice of brand), grapefruit soda, and lime juice garnished with fresh pineapple and orange slice, rimmed with salt. Everything is made from scratch. It’s hard to choose here — delicate empanadas, feather-light chile relleno, or one of the specialties, like camarones a la diabla (shrimp in spicy red sauce) chicken mole or the molcajete, a lava stone mortar filled with a combination of grilled chicken, shrimp, steak, cactus and onions, and served with salsas, beans, rice and tortillas — plenty for two people.

415 Main St. Woodland; (530) 661-3166. www.elcharrowoodland.com . Open 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Thursday, 9 a.m.-10 p.m. Friday, until 1 a.m. Saturday and 8 p.m. Sunday. Full bar. Chile Relleno, a la carte, $3.95; empanadas (three) a la carte $9.95; camarones a la diabla, $14.95; cantaritos, $7.50.

Vince’s Mexican Restaurant

Standing on its own, set back from the street and surrounded by lots of parking, Vince’s Mexican Restaurant has the austere, confident look of a place that’s a local institution. And it is: family-owned for more than 30 years, with son following father. There is plenty of seating in two large, wood-paneled dining rooms, with wooden tables and carved chairs as well as booths along the walls. The menu is a solid one, with lots of variety. The lunch specials come with vegetable soup, which, with its touch of chile, is a good, classic beginning. The light batter of the chile rellenos balances with the fresh pasilla chiles, still with a hint of crunch, and the chicken mole enchiladas are rich and flavorful. The portions are large, the service welcoming and cheerful, and Vince’s is also noted for its margaritas.

140 W. Main St., Woodland. (530) 666-6049. No website. Open 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday; 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m. Friday; 4:30-9:30 p.m. Saturday; until 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Lunch special: rice, beans and entree item — such as chile relleno or chicken mole — and soup: $7.29. Margaritas, $6.99.

Maria’s Cantina

Neighboring Sacramento calls itself the farm-to-table capital of the world, but more than a few of the farms that feed the city’s fine-dining restaurants are in Yolo County, and it’s seasonal produce from these farms that Maria’s Cantina prides itself on serving in a blend of California cuisine and Latino flavors. The restaurant has the feel of an old California adobe, with carved wooden chairs, wall hangings, colorful tile work, and upscale tableware. The salsa served with the chips is certainly among the best around, thick with roasted chiles. The menu, which has standard fare as well as more creative items, such as a seared salmon salad Veracruz style, that includes plump grilled shrimp, marinated and grilled eggplant and zucchini tossed with local wild salad greens, and a cilantro lime dressing. There is an extensive and informative Tequila menu, as well as plenty of cocktails, including an elderflower margarita. The menu’s on the pricey side, but on Tuesday Taco nights, it’s two tacos for $5, and they are not typical — chorizo with butternut squash or braised lamb for example — and it’s a good opportunity to sample some of the creative combinations that reflect Yolo farms and the chef’s inspirations.

306 Sixth St., (530) 402-1548. www.marias-cantina.com . Open 11:30 a.m.-8 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday. Full bar. Seared salmon salad a la Veracruz $16, casa carnitas $18.50, chicken burrito a la carte, $13.25, elderflower margarita (organic) $11.

Las Islitas Ostioneria

There’s no doubt that this is a seafood restaurant. Windows are partially painted in brilliant seascapes with octopus, fish and other denizens of the sea. Step inside to find the vast interior decorated with huge conches, abalone shells, and more paintings, aquariums and fishing nets. Established and owned by a family from Nayarit, the restaurant has a setting much like what you might find in a seafood restaurant along Mexico’s coast. You’ll be greeted with a bowl of ceviche, paper plates, chips and packets of saltine crackers, and if it’s on the weekend, a band might be playing (it can get pretty loud) and the TV’s muted. One side of the oversize menu is all seafood, from large or small (still pretty big) shrimp cocktails served in stemmed goblets to mixed platters of shrimp, octopus, crab and scallops and whole grilled red snapper. The other side has more seafood, plus steaks, chicken, carnitas and other non-seafood items, but Las Islitas is really about the fresh seafood. For samples, try the red shrimp and octopus tostada, which comes loaded with thin, almost shredded octopus and seven or eight large grilled shrimp, served simply with lime and a spicy green salsa on the side or the delicate shrimp empanadas chock-full of fresh shrimp.

1527 East St.; (530) 406-1503. www.lasislitaswoodland.com . 11 a.m.-8 p.m. daily. Shrimp and octopus tostada, $6.75, shrimp empanadas (three) $7.99, seafood platters start at $13.99.

While referred candidates are typically highly qualified and greatly valued by businesses, these programs can quickly exhaust the networks of internal employees. As David Samuels, CEO of ReferralMob, pointed out, internal referral programs can be a productive channel for identifying talent but are very limited in terms of usage.

ReferralMob serves as a matchmaking platform that aims to address this challenge and many others that are inherent to the hiring process by magnifying the number of referrals a company can receive. To do this, ReferralMob takes the referral process outside of the four walls of the business.

Improving the Short Stack

Think of it as “uberizing the recruiting industry,” which is exactly how Samuels describes the process.

The platform enables members of the public to monetize their valuable professional networks through making referrals to great job opportunities that are available from employers on ReferralMob’s network. They are paid when those referrals result in successfully hiring a candidate, resulting in a win-win-win situation for all involved.

The employer finds a highly qualified candidate, the candidate finds a new job and the referrer makes $1,000 for making the connection.

ReferralMob CTO Joe Schwendt has also built in value-add features that ensure the platform goes beyond just acting as the middle man. The platform’s machine learning technology enables ReferralMob to identify who is actually qualified and has the experience and skills identified by the employer for that role before the candidate ever reaches the employer.

ReferralMob also has every referred resume reviewed by an experienced HR recruiter and only then provides employers with the candidates who actually meet their qualifications, thereby reducing the time it takes and enabling the employer to move right to the interview stage of the hiring process.

“We’re really all about providing that short stack of candidates versus wading through hundreds of candidates to find that small subset that’s really going to be the ideal people to talk to,” Schwendt explained.

Schwendt also noted that the platform focused on taking out every minor point of friction in the hiring process, from how you make a referral to how you apply to a job. Potential candidates can apply to a job using their mobile device in just about two minutes and, with two additional taps, apply to another relevant job posting.

In this week’s episode of The Matchmaker Is In series, Samuels and Schwendt joined host Karen Webster to discuss how speeding up and simplifying the hiring process through matchmaking is addressing frictions on both sides of the platform.

Here is an excerpt of their conversation.

KW: The friction you’re removing on the employer side is better access to a higher-quality candidate pool, because someone is only going to refer someone they are confident will be a qualified candidate, right?

JS: It’s actually really difficult to get people to apply to jobs if there are a lot of hurdles in their way. If you’re a full-time job seeker because you’re out of work, you have all day to sit there and apply to a job. However, I think it’s pretty well understood that the best candidates are usually already employed, and they don’t necessarily have the time nor the desire to sit through an hour- or two-hour-long application process. Even if the opportunity sounds great, it’s got to be simple and easy.

DS: One of the frictions we remove is that a lot of the most qualified and talented people out there already have jobs. In fact, many are happily employed. What the data shows is that 80 percent of millennials who characterize themselves as happily employed are open to learning about new opportunities, as long as they’re provided by a trusted relationship. That’s what the referral does — it’s someone whom they’ve worked with in the past, whom they respect, or it can even be more of the social relationship. That’s what really makes us effective: the ability to take and present great, new opportunities to those who aren’t already in the job market and to present these candidates to employers who wouldn’t ordinarily be able to interview these candidates because they aren’t looking for work.

KW: Does a member of your platform refer a candidate to a particular employer and job opening, or do they just refer them to the platform itself for future possibilities?

DS: We have two sides to our platform — the employer, on the one hand, and consumers, on the other (whom we call Mobbers), who comprise both referrers as well as candidates. In general, most of our referrals are for specific positions. I might happen to know of a great CTO position at a company that’s approaching unicorn status, and I could send Joe a text message to make him aware of that particular opportunity. He would click on the message, click on the link and be able to take a look at a short summary of that opportunity. There are times, however, where I might simply refer Joe to ReferralMob and explain that there are a lot of opportunities on the app he might not have heard about before.

KW: What kind job openings are most of your Mobbers trying to refer or apply to? Do you have particular specialties or levels? Help us understand your market.

JS: We don’t think about it in terms of industries as much as job categories. Typically, when you are an accountant, you can be an accountant at a BioTech firm as easily as you could be an accountant for a restaurant or startup. We focus everything around the individual and what category of job they would be able to fill. We play in categories like accounts and finance, IT software development, creative design, sales, marketing, etc. Those are some of the areas we specialize in, and it cuts across industries.

KW: Every single matchmaker has the proverbial chicken-and-egg dilemma to crack — you need both sides at scale or at least with enough critical mass to make the other attractive. Where did you start? Did you start by rustling up a pool of employers willing to take a shot at something new and then assemble the network of candidates? Or did you start the other way?

DS: We decided that the most attractive approach would be to speak with employers and share our ideas of what we were looking to accomplish on their behalf. For those who were excited by the prospect of being on the receiving end of more qualified candidate referrals, we then took the next step and asked if they would be an early adopter and be willing to post a few openings on the platform. We let them know in advance that it might take us a few weeks to go out and recruit our mob, or the crowdsourced referred applicants. It didn’t take us very long; probably within the first six months, we had roughly 200 Boston-based companies sign up to our Terms and Conditions and start posting jobs. That is when we started reaching out to the crowdsourced network to start building that out. It didn’t take long for referrers and candidates to begin applying. In our very first year, we had over 10,000 referrals in the Boston market alone.

KW: Wow! So how did you recruit your Mob? Where did you go find those individuals?

DS: It was a combination of basic marketing — everything including content marketing, event marketing and email marketing. It’s also a topic that is near and dear to so many people. Outside of family, one’s employment is a critically important topic, and there are a lot of professionals in the Boston area who felt like they were in a position to help out a friend or former colleague.

KW: The features that are built into the platform add a layer of intelligence and creates a short stack of qualified candidates. So you’re not just bringing a candidate together with an employer — you’re adding more value than that by vetting those candidates.

JS: Yes, absolutely! The adding of the machine learning aspect was a big key for us to be able to scale the model. We take every candidate’s credentials and every job description and match those against each other to determine a simple score. The score is really an aid to our decision-making process. For example, if the match score turns out to be a 2 out of 10, the likelihood of us declining on behalf of the employer is pretty high. Whereas if they come through and score an 8, then the likelihood of us passing them through is pretty good. However, it’s the 5s, 6s and 7s of the world that require much more scrutiny, and algorithms can’t do this alone today. There are just too many variables to consider — we have to take into account the company the candidate was last at, what their job experience was, what they accomplished while there, how their career progression has been, what they are looking for in their next role, etc. We also have to then channel the inner employer and understand through the nuance of the job description, realistically, what it is that they’re looking for. I do wish it was more simple — online dating is almost much easier of a problem to solve. But it’s something we care deeply about, and we really do want to make meaningful, good and solid matches happen.

KW: How do you guys make money? Presumably the employer pays you, because someone has to pay the Mob … so how does that all work?

DS: ReferralMob takes its obligation to pay the Mobbers itself. Right now we are paying the Mob $1,000 on successful referrals and hires, and our employers pay us more than that. There’s some gross margin there for us — right now we charge employers $2,750 for matches. As you can probably determine, that’s roughly 10 percent of the cost of a recruiting agency itself. Our fees are only success-based, so our employers don’t take on a lot of risk in terms of posting with us. In the event that one of our referred candidates leaves within three months of being hired, which has only happened twice, we do provide a guarantee and return of the fees that we charged the employers.

KW: Since we do cover payments, I’m curious to know how you pay your referrers. Do you put it into their PayPal account, or does it go right into their checking account? How do you pay people?

DS: It’s almost exclusively checks, but having said that, we will make bank-to-bank transfers when that’s requested of us. But certainly from a payment perspective, maybe that’s a conversation Joe and I can have with you, Karen, down the road to get a little bit of advice in terms of what you’re seeing in the marketplace and how you see people liking to get paid.

KW: Don’t be surprised if your phone lines start lighting up with people who have an idea for you! We have a hashtag here going called #KillTheCheck, so I have to say let’s kill the check!

One last question before we wrap — we always love to ask innovators who are taking on the hard work of getting a platform like this off the ground who you’ve taken inspiration from. I can probably guess Uber, since you’re uberizing the recruiting industry. But thinking broadly about successful matchmakers across lots of industries and best practices, are there any others that come to mind?

DS: Uber, Airbnb and others are really the inspiration for us. It’s always been about monetizing certain assets that people own but have never been able to turn into something valuable. We feel that professional networks fall within that category.

JS: I also think a lot of this has just been based upon our own experiences — that we know who the dominant players are in our space, and we know where they are falling short. Part of it is just building a bigger, better mousetrap that solves for some of those inefficiencies. That’s part of the reason we are building what we are, because we feel like we have the correct answer for a lot of those inefficiencies."

When outsiders think of classic California slang, it's the southern half of the state that tends to get all the credit. Surfer talk and valley girl dominate the California slang stereotypes, but that leaves out the slang our region has given the world.

In the Bay Area, things are a little more gritty. We're less about beaches and malls and more about the local hip hop scene, a place that has given the region many of its most famous slang terms.

Then, of course, there's hella.

The Bay Area's greatest gift to the slang world, hella first began appearing in the 1970s. According to linguists, the word's origins are murky, but they believe it popped up first in the black community in Oakland. Hella was the stuff of high school halls and sporting events for a while, but it wasn't until musicians brought it into the national lexicon that it started taking off.

One of the first to use hella in national interviews was James Hetfield of Metallica. The band formed in Southern California, but gained a national platform after moving to the East Bay in 1983 (the group lived for a while in a house in El Cerrito).

Hella went truly mainstream with the explosion of the hyphy movement in the 1990s. Local rappers E-40 and Mac Dre elevated hella from an occasional qualifier to a mainstay of the NorCal dialect. By 1993, linguists were classifying it as a distinctly Bay Area word. In 2002, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

There are also contributions to the world's lexicon from the tech and social justice communities in the Bay Area. For example, the phrase ""lean in"" was contributed by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and the term ""mansplaining"" came from Bay Area author Rebecca Solnit.

http://fortune.com/2016/08/24/tesla-100kwh-battery-pack/,pos,0.9999999976439864,2.356071499817195e-09,Why Tesla's New Battery Pack Is Important,2016-08-24 00:00:00,2019-06-25 15:39:54.231898,Katie Fehrenbacher,"Tesla Motors announced a breakthrough on Tuesday that was the stuff of energy nerds: a new battery pack for its performance cars that packed more energy into it.

The not-so-geeky result of that new 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack are cars that can accelerate more quickly and can drive for longer on a single charge.

This milestone isn’t just another notch on Tesla’s belt. It shows how as Tesla (tsla) continues to innovate, it’s leading the auto industry, and it’s far ahead of competitors when it comes to developing electric car battery technology.

According to Tesla, the new Model S P100D—thanks to the new battery pack—is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced (including traditional gas-powered cars). And at 315 miles, it has the longest range ever for a production electric vehicle.

It was only six or so years ago that Tesla’s first car, the $100,000 Roadster, was enabling its early customers to travel a little over 200 miles on a single charge. Then came the Model S, which kicked up the range closer to 300 miles on a single charge, followed by an optional upgrade to a 90 kilowatt-hour battery pack last year.

Thanks to Tesla’s engineers, the company has now crammed even more energy into the same size pack, using the same battery cells. Tesla’s battery packs contain thousands of lithium-ion battery cells that discharge energy to power the car. Customers can upgrade to the 100-kilowatt hour battery pack from the 90-kilowatt hour battery pack for a charge.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk said during a call with reporters on Tuesday that the 100-kilowatt battery pack is coming close to reaching the theoretical limit of how much energy density the company can pack into that size and shape battery pack using those specific batteries.

For Tesla to achieve a higher energy density for future battery packs, it would need to improve the battery chemistry itself by adding new materials or tweaking the battery cell design. If Tesla wanted to create an even more powerful battery, it would have to make the battery pack bigger, but that would add on weight to and change the shape of the cars.

Instead of changing the external pack shape or size or cell chemistry for the 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack, Tesla created a whole new battery cell cooling system and rearranged the battery cell architecture and electronics, explained Tesla’s CTO JB Straubel on the call.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

It’s likely Tesla added in more battery cells to the same shape pack, but it was able to still place the cells in a position where they could be adequately cooled while charging and discharging. (Batteries heat up when they charge and discharge.)

The big fear is that the more energy-dense a battery pack is, the bigger the risk that there could be a fire if there’s an accident. Tesla needs to be careful, because—like with internal combustion cars—cars can catch on fire and Tesla needs to assure its customers that its cars are safe.

“It’s been quite a challenging development,” Musk said.

The 100-kilowatt hour battery pack will only be sold to Tesla’s high-end cars for now, and will only represent maybe 10% of production, said Musk. But down the road, Tesla will eventually offer the 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack for all versions of the Model S and Model X.

The 100-kilowatt hour battery pack will help differentiate the Model S and Model X from the less expensive Model 3, which is supposed to cost $35,000 and start shipping at the end of 2017. The range of the Model 3 isn’t supposed to be any more than 250 miles per charge, according to analysts.

The Model 3 will have new lithium-ion batteries made at Tesla’s Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. Those batteries will be bigger (wider and longer) than the traditional ones, packing more materials into each battery. They’ll also use the latest in battery chemistry, including using silicon in the anode part of the battery. A battery has an anode and a cathode, as well as an electrolyte medium that shuttles lithium ions between the anode and cathode.

Battery technology is meaningless unless it’s delivering a better electric car. Tesla’s 100-kilowatt hour battery pack is an auto industry breakthrough that shows what a company can do with current battery technology and car design. No other company is producing electric cars on a production basis with a 315-mile range.

That milestone will also help set the bar for what customers will expect from other automakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), and Nissan. And Tesla’s move will push these automakers to try to get close to or match Tesla’s new features."
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solarcity-m-a-tesla-idUSKCN10C26O,pos,1.0,1.522822601909953e-34,SolarCity accepts Tesla's $2.6 billion offer; both shares fall,2016-08-01 21:54:33,2019-06-25 15:40:18.168521,Paul Lienert + Min Read,"(Reuters) - SolarCity Corp SCTY.O agreed to Tesla Motors Inc’s (TSLA.O) $2.6 billion offer to buy the solar panel installer, the companies said on Monday, clearing one obstacle in the way of Elon Musk’s ambitious plans for a carbon-free energy and transportation company.

Tesla’s offer represented about half of SolarCity’s value a year ago, a tumble reflecting the solar company’s slowing growth, complex financial structure and the increased scrutiny of government incentives for rooftop solar.

For Tesla, acquiring SolarCity offers the promise of greater economies of scale in electrical energy management systems, battery production and marketing, tempered by the near-term challenge of managing a high-risk ramp-up of vehicle production and a merger simultaneously.

Standard & Poors said Monday it put Tesla’s credit ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications “to reflect the significant risks related to the sustainability of the company’s capital structure following the proposed transaction.”

Tesla’s stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, or $200 million less than the initial proposal Musk outlined in June, before advisers to the companies had done due diligence.

SolarCity shares shed 7.4 per cent on Monday to close at $24.72, a level that suggests most shareholders are betting the deal will be approved. Tesla shares closed down 2 percent at $230.01.

The company on Monday cut its forecast for full-year installations by 10 percent from prior guidance. In 2017, SolarCity said it expects improvement driven by integrated battery storage offerings and “a new solar product focused on the 5 million new roofs installed each year in the U.S.”

SolarCity has come under pressure from rivals offering low-cost solar energy from large, utility-scale installations, and because some state governments have reined in subsidies that encouraged rooftop solar.

“SolarCity’s cost of capital is higher than the individual in most cases,” Musk said on a call Monday, adding SolarCity could focus on selling systems to homeowners, financed through their mortgages.

Tesla shares also dipped, as Musk repeated that if the deal is consummated, the combined Tesla-SolarCity could require a “small equity capital raise” next year. Until Friday’s close, Tesla shares were up 7 percent since the company first announced its proposal. Tesla said in a regulatory filing it would issue shares as part of the transaction.

Musk, chairman of both Tesla and SolarCity, said a capital increase could be a “low to mid single digit” percentage of Tesla’s market capitalization, which on Monday was about $34 billion.

Both companies have been burning through cash, although they have projected achieving positive cash flow later this year. SolarCity Chief Executive Officer Lyndon Rive, who is Musk’s cousin, repeated that forecast during a conference call on Monday.

Musk last week said it could ultimately cost Tesla “tens of billions” of dollars over several years to develop a pickup truck, a semi truck and a “spacebus” people hauler as outlined in his new strategic plan for the automaker.

Some analysts are skeptical that combining Tesla and SolarCity will yield a quick turnaround.

“When two highly leveraged companies that have to raise huge amounts of capital merge, you don’t get a stronger company. You get a larger company that combines the weaknesses of both smaller companies,” said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

Analysts who follow SolarCity expressed more upbeat outlooks. JP Morgan called the offer “attractive,” saying it would give “capital-hungry SCTY better access to wholesale capital markets via its acquirer’s balance sheet.’’

Tesla has enjoyed strong demand for its stock, and raised about $1.7 billion with a share sale in May.

COST SAVINGS

Musk said the plan to consolidate two clean energy businesses in which he has large stakes will remove barriers to growth between companies he always intended to function as one.

Musk and Tesla Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler said the companies could save at least $150 million a year by combining sales forces, and sending one truck to a home to install solar panels, a Tesla energy storage system and a recharging system for a Tesla car. Now, as many as three trucks and technicians might go.

Musk said a combined SolarCity and Tesla should be able to spend less on manufacturing and capital investments than they would have separately, and will be able to negotiate deals with utility companies more quickly.

Musk said Tesla and SolarCity are already working on consolidating and sharing key technologies, such as electronic power controls. “If it doesn’t go through, it will be awkward,” he said.

Delivering on those promises will add to Tesla’s ambitious agenda. Over the next two years, the luxury electric carmaker plans to increase vehicle production roughly fivefold at its Fremont, California, assembly plant as it starts making the Model 3 sedan and related vehicles.

Tesla later this year plans to start production of car batteries at its Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. Tesla and partner Panasonic Corp (6752.T) have begun installing complex, automated battery manufacturing equipment in parts of the plant as construction continues. Musk has said the Gigafactory ultimately will have solar power systems on its roof.

Musk is the largest shareholder in both companies, and if the transaction goes through could increase his stake in Tesla from about 21 per cent to 23.4 percent, including the conversion of his current stake in SolarCity.

His cousins Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive are co-founders of SolarCity. The companies share board members and major shareholders. SolarCity formed a special committee to evaluate the Tesla offer, and Musk said he had no say in the final acquisition price.

Final approval of the deal will depend on independent shareholders. The deal includes an unusually long “go-shop” provision that allows SolarCity to solicit offers from other potential buyers for 45 days through Sept. 14.

Musk and sources familiar with the situation have said they are confident the deal will win needed support.

Daniel Marcus, principal of Marcus Capital LLC, a Chicago investment adviser which owned 22,100 Tesla shares at the end of June, said he supports the takeover bid and Musk’s long-range plan.

“If some people see things three steps ahead, Elon Musk is 10 steps ahead,” Marcus said.

Musk has wooed larger shareholders, including managers at Fidelity Investments whose funds are among the biggest owners of both SolarCity and Tesla stock, outside of Musk.

SolarCity was a Wall Street darling following its 2012 initial public offering thanks to supercharged growth of its no-money-down rooftop solar offerings. SolarCity said late last year it would grow more slowly and focus on generating cash and cutting costs. The company’s shares hit $81 in early 2014.

The company’s outlook has darkened as government policies that underpinned the rooftop solar sector’s expansion in recent years face increased scrutiny in many U.S. states."

INDIANAPOLIS -- An Indiana state Senate committee on Thursday effectively tabled a controversial proposal to prevent Tesla Motors from selling cars in Indiana under its current business model.

Sen. Jim Buck, chairman of the Senate Commerce and Technology Committee, had supported a version of the bill that would have banned manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. That version of the legislation would have caused Tesla's dealer license to expire in 2018 and forced the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to either adopt a franchise dealer model or stop selling cars in Indiana. Tesla has a 2-year-old showroom at Fashion Mall at Keystone.

Buck on Thursday opened the committee hearing by saying he has been on the receiving end of ""incivility"" from Tesla supporters this week, as the bill received national attention.

Buck and the bill's author, Rep. Kevin Mahan, agreed to put the issue before a study committee. ​That means the legislature won't consider a ban on direct auto sales until at least next year.

""We are trying to make what we are doing here fair to all,"" Buck said.

Todd Maron, the general counsel for Tesla, said in a prepared statement that automaker looks forward to a summer session where the bill is supposed to be reconsidered.

General Motors, which has four facilities in Indiana, supports a ban on direct auto sales. It argues that Tesla has a unique advantage in Indiana. Existing state law prevents General Motors and other automakers from opening sales centers, such as Tesla's, that would compete with its dealerships.

Tesla shares fell 2.2 percent following the announcement, which came after the market closed. They were $206.59 in after market trading, well below the $242 a share price at which the company last issued new shares, in August 2015.

Tesla, which has posted operating losses since its initial public offering in June, 2010, said in a prospectus it expected to sell as many as 8.2 million shares at a price of $204.66 a share.

Last month, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said he might need to raise additional cash after receiving 373,000 reservations for the Model 3. Musk said he would respond to demand for the Model 3 by tooling up Tesla’s factories to build 500,000 vehicles a year in 2018, two years earlier than planned. The Model 3 will start at $35,000 before tax breaks.

In tandem with the sale of shares by Tesla, Musk will sell nearly 2.8 million of his own shares, which at current prices is worth almost $600 million.

Tesla must fund as much as $2.25 billion in capital spending Musk has forecast for this year, mainly to equip its factories and suppliers to build the Model 3. Tesla had about $1.44 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, including borrowing from an asset backed credit line.

Tesla reported a net loss of $282.3 million for the first quarter, and noted in its prospectus “we have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to achieve sustained, long-term profitability and long-term commercial success.”

Suppliers and analysts say Musk’s timetable for reaching production of 500,000 vehicles a year is ambitious, at roughly 10 times the company’s production in 2015.

The Tesla prospectus highlighted strong demand for the Model 3.

“We have obtained this level of reservations without any advertising or paid endorsements, with only a few social media posts leading up to the March 31st unveiling, without anybody but those who were in attendance on March 31st having had an opportunity to test drive the car, without yet publicly disclosing numerous features about the car,” Tesla stated.

“If we wanted to, we believe that we could further increase the number of Model 3 reservations with minimal effort,” the company added.

Tesla has disclosed that the final design of the Model 3 will not be completed until next month.

Tesla previously has raised more than $4.5 billion in debt and equity offerings over the past six years. Since it raised $226 million in an initial public offering in June 2010, Tesla has gone back to the capital markets several times.

Musk will sell 2.8 million of his own shares primarily to pay taxes related to the exercise of vested stock options to purchase 5,503,972 Tesla shares. Musk already controls a 26.7 percent stake in Tesla, according to the company’s latest proxy statement. The exercise will increase Musk’s stake in the company, Tesla said."

Tesla killed the entry-level S within a year because no one wanted it. The next cheapest version, the 60-kWh Model S, died last year. Tesla replaced it with a 70-kWh model that starts at about $75,000.



And this year, Tesla replaced the 85-kWh battery pack in the range-topping Model S with a 90-kWh setup. The upside to steadily increasing the size of the batteries is cars with greater range (the 90D goes 294 miles on a charge). The downside? More expensive cars. So much for the “affordable” Model S Musk promised all those years ago."

One Twitter user told Musk that a Tesla pickup truck is needed. Musk responded by saying that he promises Tesla will ""make a pickup truck right after Model Y.""

Musk is ""dying to build it,"" he tweeted.

When asked if the pickup would be comparable in size to Ford's F-150 line of trucks, Musk said it would have a ""similar total size."" He added that the Tesla truck may be slightly bigger, saying it he wants it to account ""for a really game changing"" feature.

The other vehicle mentioned, the Model Y, is a crossover that Musk has hinted at both on Twitter and on a Tesla conference call earlier this year. Musk said in May that the Model Y would be built ""using substantial carryover from [the Model] 3 in order to bring it to market faster.""

Many queries focused on existing Tesla software and design. Angel investor Jason Calacanis suggested a ""family arriving home alert,"" using a vehicle's navigation system presets to tell others when the vehicle would be returning to a designated home location — to which Musk said ""sure.""

Others asked for updates to the Model S browser, such as a night mode and the option to open mobile versions of websites. Musk said that the existing browser is ""terrible"" but that ""major browser upgrades"" are coming ""to all cars in a few months.""

Users asked for more information about the second version of Autopilot — the self-driving feature standard on all Tesla vehicles. Musk said the new software is ""going through exhaustive testing"" and said Tesla is working on features such as ""a rain sensor."" Another person asked about further remote controls, such as turning on a Tesla's heated features via the mobile app. Musk says those features ""should be in the next update.""

Musk often — especially more than most chief executives — responds to questions and comments on Twitter. Whether it is to explain upcoming Tesla software changes, taking feedback on elements of design or even to combat critics, Musk is very accustomed to responding to his mass following online. His responses range from matter-of-fact explanations to jokes about SpaceX launches — such as when Musk responded to one user that the Falcon 9 launch seen by millions in the sky above Los Angeles on Friday ""was definitely aliens.""

Tesla stock has risen more than 49 percent this year as of Friday's close at $325.20 per share, according to FactSet."

Most of them predict that about half of new vehicle production will be electric at some point between 2035 and 2040.

Now Tesla CEO Elon Musk jumps in with his own prediction, which is unsurprisingly much more aggressive.

At the National Governors Association today, Musk said that he expects “more than half of new vehicles” will be electric in the US within the next 10 years or roughly 10 to 15 years ahead of most predictions. He said:

“I think things are going to grow exponentially. There’s a big difference between 5 and 10 years. My guess is probably in 10 years more than half of new vehicle production is electric in the United States.”

We gave a similar prediction back in May when Morgan Stanley projected that electric vehicle sales will surpass gas-powered cars by 2040. We suggested that due to rapidly falling battery costs, there will be a point between 2020 and 2025 when all-electric powertrains reach cost parity with internal combustion engines before accounting for the cost of operation (gas and maintenance savings).

At that point, there will be virtually no reason for buyers to want gas-powered cars over battery-powered cars and automakers will divert all their investments to electric vehicles.

Musk specifically referred to new vehicles coming to market in the US – stating that it will take a few more years until all production is electric and then a few more to replace the existing fleet.

Interestingly, Tesla’s CEO added that it will likely happen even sooner in China, where they have been more aggressive with their regulations. He even referenced the fact that virtually all automakers (except for Tesla) are asking the Chinese government to slow down their electric car mandate.

Furthermore, while he expects over 50% of new vehicles to be electric in the US within 10 years, he thinks that “almost all” new vehicles will be autonomous within the same timeframe. Add another 10 years and he thinks that all vehicles will not even feature a steering wheel anymore.

Here’s the relevant part of his talk with Nevada Governor Sandoval at the NGA meeting today:

Evidently, Tesla is trying to be ahead of the curve on both fronts. Of course, all of Tesla’s vehicles are already electric, but the company also considers all its current new vehicles to support fully self-driving.

The vehicles produced by Tesla since October 2016 are equipped with a sensor suite and onboard computer that the automaker believes will support fully autonomous driving. They are currently working on the software, which they plan to send to the fleet over-the-air at some point in the future and make all their vehicles produced since last year fully autonomous.

Most other automakers have timelines ranging from 2019 to 2025 for their first autonomous vehicles, but plans to make all vehicle production autonomous are rarer. Same goes for electric vehicle production. Most automakers are currently guiding 20 to 40% of their production to be electric on Musk’s “over than 50%” timeline.

The company — called Neuralink — will be the vehicle for the development of the ""neural lace"" Musk discussed on Twitter and elsewhere, the The Wall Street Journal first reported. Musk later confirmed the existence of the company in a tweet and said that more details were coming ""in about a week"".

The ""neural lace"" Musk has talked about is typically described as an implant or an appendage that would be attached to the brain, that would provide a way for brains to interact with devices, or otherwise augment human intelligence.

Speaking at the Code Conference in 2016, Musk said to think of the arrangement this way: ""You have your limbic system, the cortex, and then a digital layer, sort of a third layer above the cortex that could work well and symbiotically with you."""

2017 could arguably be called the year of Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, he seemed to be everywhere, doing just about everything. From Australian megabatteries, to teasing the world by suggesting he might blast a Tesla Roadster into space, Musk has dipped his toes into every sector. From Neuralink to Tesla to SpaceX and even the Boring Company, Musk is revolutionizing the way we think about and approach transportation, space travel, and even our own brains. So let’s take a look back at 2017 through the Twitter of the man who is taking reality and shaping it for the future:

Musk’s first tweet of 2017 marked progress in the reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Within this year alone, SpaceX launched 16 Falcon 9 rockets. In the new year, they expect to launch the Falcon Heavy, which includes boosters and modified first-stages from Falcon 9 rockets. The advancement of reusable rockets will allow us to further embrace space exploration.

Later in January, Musk retweeted Tesla on exploring the potential of long-term battery life and charging networks for electric vehicles. These developing technologies will be a firm part of the foundation that allows us to develop EV-friendly infrastructure and break away from fossil fuels.

He also tweeted about Hyperloop, which was not yet Virgin Hyperloop One. This year, more serious testing began for the advanced transportation technology.

Musk also made clear social commentary. He denounced the travel ban that the president signed in late January, while also asking for specific public suggestions on how to present his dissatisfaction to Donald Trump, as Musk was still on his advisory board at the time.

Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President. https://t.co/qLpbsP4lEk — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017

NASA announced in February that solar arrays were deployed on the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, an announcement that Musk retweeted. This cargo craft has furthered the relationship between the government-based and private aerospace organizations.

When a group of scientists revisited the Drake equation in March, Musk even eloquently inquired about the current status of extraterrestrial detection. This year, many advances have been made to further our understanding of what could make life in the universe possible, as efforts made to detect habitable planets and contact potential extraterrestrial neighbors continued to move forward.

Musk also retweeted OpenAI, which he helped to found. This year saw an incredible array of advancements in artificial intelligence and in the ability of these systems to learn.

Neuralink took the world by storm as it brought to the forefront the concept of brain-computer interfaces. Musk’s work towards this “cyborg” goal became actualized this year.

In May, as throughout the year, Musk joked about his pun-titled Boring Company while they continue to dig and make progress in building a tunnel under Los Angeles. The L.A. tunnel will be used to ferry cars and people, and eventually, the company hopes, house a working Hyperloop.

What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2017

After President Trump announced his intentions to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, Elon Musk publicly stated his departure from the President’s advisory council. He concisely expressed his feelings about the departure and the very real threats of climate change on Twitter.

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017

Looking beyond the problems of our own planet, Musk also further legitimized plans to go to Mars. Previous inklings of future hopes to colonize the red planet became developing plans.

Despite his continued investment and work in its advancement, in August Musk warned the public of the potential dangers of AI. He stressed the need for regulation of this potentially disruptive technology.

In November, Musk and Tesla finally revealed the Tesla semi, the electric semi truck that promises to make long-distance shipping a greener and more energy-efficient industry. Large companies have already responded to the new semi with enthusiasm.

He also took to Twitter to publicly confirmed rumors that the Boring company would compete for the contract to build a tunnel connecting Chicago’s airport to the city’s downtown, but clarified that the short route would not be a hyperloop.

In December, Musk managed to sneak one last success through the closing door of 2017, when the battery Tesla built for South Australia smoothly kicked in to save the region’s energy grid after a coal plant failure. Afterwards, he retweeted an article about how the battery is already re-shaping the energy market in Australia.

“Just a @elonmusk stunt” they said, yet it’s already affecting the whole Australian electricity market. https://t.co/Be4MmckeWU — Mark Nottingham (@mnot) December 19, 2017

From defying government decisions to supporting efforts against climate change, revolutionizing transportation, and making a human future on Mars seem possible, Elon Musk has had a big year. As it drew to a close, however, he did take time to appreciate the network that let him share it all with us.

Elon Musk committed a bit of a Twitter blunder late Tuesday. The billionaire inventor and CEO of Tesla (tsla) and SpaceX (spacex) was trying to get in touch with John Carmack, the chief technology officer at Oculus, Facebook’s (fb) virtual reality project. But instead of sending a private message, Musk tweeted directly at Carmack, so his 16.7 million followers could see it, Business Insider reports.

“Do you have a sec to talk? My cell is…” the tweet read before listing a phone number. Musk’s tweet was quickly deleted, but not before several followers noticed.

CNBC rang the number Musk posted and discovered a recorded message from the video game God of War. The audio clip, recorded by game creator David Jaffe, is one of two secret codes hidden in the game. “By the Gods you’ve done it,” the message says. “Somehow you’ve found your way here to me. I offer you my congratulations and my respect.”

You can hear the message yourself here, but probably not on Musk’s phone anytime soon — he’ll likely be changing that number."

This article is part of a ""Reporter's Notebook"" series, wherein CNBC journalists submit tales and observations from the field.

To Elon Musk's audience, the storied entrepreneur is less of a CEO than he is a rockstar.

That's what I learned after covering an afternoon of events by his companies SpaceX and Tesla in Australia, where the tech mogul hosted presentations.

He speaks quickly, doesn't take questions and as soon as he's done, he's shuffled off stage, not to be seen again.

During the SpaceX update of plans to send humans to Mars, Elon Musk was interrupted by one of several thousand audience members, who yelled, ""You can do it, Elon!""

Applause erupted and with a smirk, Musk replied with a simple, ""Thank you,"" and wrapped up his speech.

The afternoon -- which involved pushy crowds tamed by security guards -- took me from the SpaceX announcement in Adelaide, Australia, to the nation's rural farmlands, via a three-hour media bus ride to a party for Tesla's new battery farm in Hornsdale wind farms.

Rumor had it that Musk took a private jet.

Even with a private jet, it wouldn't be an easy place to get to. We were more than 9,000 miles away from Silicon Valley.

It was an afternoon of bright lights, stages, and music that stirred up flashbacks of my days working at MTV News, covering 'traditional' celebrities.

Musk isn't a traditional celebrity by entertainment or business standards: The vast majority of the world doesn't own any of his companies' products nor has it used any of their services, yet he has 13 million Twitter followers. That trounces Apple CEO Tim Cook's seven million.

Tesla's founder is admired by so many, most likely, because he's a visionary. No challenge seems to be too big for the entrepreneur and tech mogul.

But Musk may seem like a dreamer, more than a doer. His company is, after all, pursuing what could be the ultimate pipe dream: colonizing Mars.

He loves to talk in broad strokes and lay out his audacious visions for transforming human transportation.

His SpaceX presentation at the International Astronautical Congress, which is essentially the world's largest space conference, was less than focused. He touched on everything from colonizing Mars, to space tourism, to using his rocket design to shorten travel from New York City to Shanghai to less than 30 minutes.

Watching him speak, you can't help but feel that he's one of those people who thinks faster than they talk.

His presentation style is unrehearsed, which might be exactly what makes people like him. In the same speech, he can switch between technical terms, such as ""240 tons of CH4 and 860 tons of oxygen"" to abbreviations, such as BFR, short for ""Big F-----g Rocket.""

But while his afternoon SpaceX speech matched his grandiose vision, by evening, he was putting his money where his mouth was when he confirmed Tesla is building the world's largest lithium ion battery plant in South Australia, which he expected to be completed by the end of the year.

The event was held under one large white tent in the middle of rural Australia, surrounded by trendy music, passed gourmet hors d'oeuvres and an open bar.

Musk spoke for just under ten minutes.

But even with an out-sized travel time and presumable jet lag, Musk still exuded palpable excitement.

""Talk is cheap,"" he told the crowd, while standing on stage. ""Action is difficult. We wanted to show that it's not just talk, it's reality."""

Elon Musk has filed a permit to dig a tunnel within Los Angeles city limits that would alleviate the standstill traffic the City of Angels is famous for.

Last week, The Boring Company, the firm Musk created to build the tunnel, filed an application with city officials to start digging within city limits, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Musk tweeted a photo of the first stage of the project near his office in Hawthorne, in southwestern Los Angeles County near Los Angeles International Airport, on Oct. 28.

The the initial proposed route would stretch along Interstate 405 from Hawthorne to Westwood, and the project will be funded entirely by private money, a spokesperson for The Boring Co. said Tuesday, according to the Times. Last month, Musk expressed hopes that the tunnel would stretch the ""whole 405"" corridor from LAX to Interstate 101 in ""a year or so.""

The tunnel would also allow travel from Westwood to LAX in just six minutes, Musk claimed at a TED Conference in April, calling traffic ""one of the most soul-destroying things.""

""It affects people in every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life,"" Musk said. ""It’s horrible. It’s particularly horrible in LA.""

The company decided that tunnels were the optimal solution to L.A.'s traffic problem because ""there is no practical limit to how many lawyers of tunnels can be built,"" according to its website. In addition, the tunnels will be weatherproof, they won't ""divide communities with lanes and barriers,"" and their construction will be ""silent and invisible to anyone on the surface.""

Stations will be placed along the route, where the electric skates, each an ""autonomous vehicle,"" will take ""express"" trips through a main tunnel, according to the website. Side tunnels will be connected to the main tunnel for entry and exit, so passengers can ""travel directly to their final destination without stopping.""

""Therefore, unlike trains, the skate’s average speed is very close to its maximum speed,"" the website states. ""And with no intermediate stopping, there is no practical upper limit to the number of stations along the alignment, and the stations can be built as small as a single parking space.""

The Boring Company released a video in April that showed a car being lowered to the tunnel by a platform at street level. The platform, or ""skate,"" then takes the car through the tunnel at a high speed.

Each skate will be able to carry either a single automobile or eight to 16 passengers, according to The Boring Company.

Musk founded The Boring Company after complaining for years about the traffic he faced during his commute from his home in Bel-Air to his office in Hawthorne, the Times reported."

""10 hat aficionados, in appreciation for their exquisite taste in millinery, will be picked at random to tour the LA tunnel & drive boring machine,"" Musk said Thursday via his personal Twitter account.

Musk, who is also CEO of electric car maker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, became frustrated with the traffic in Los Angeles and decided he would start digging tunnels underneath the roads to provide a faster transportation alternative. He called his new tunneling venture The Boring Company (pun intended) and has been selling promotional hats for his company like hotcakes.

First made available for sale in October, Musk has sold more than 35,000 hats, according to his most recent update on Twitter.

That means Musk has made more than $700,000 pedaling hats. In a humorous nod to the success of the sale, the tech exec changed his Twitter bio to ""hat salesman."" He has said he is going to sell 50,000 hats, which would be $1 million worth of merchandise.

“The jobs data is a compelling argument in favor of the tax credits,” Mr. Hughes said.

He noted that federal solar subsidies were set to expire anyway in a few years, a result of rare bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Mr. Musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed.

And Tesla is also expanding rapidly. Tesla employs 25,000 workers in the United States and could easily double that as it ramps up production for its new Model 3 and expands its Gigafactory, a lithium ion battery manufacturing operation in Nevada. “I don’t know what kind of multiplier you put on that, but it’s a significant boost to the economy,” Mr. Jonas said.

Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200,000 vehicles, a level Tesla may soon reach.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk appear to have other areas of overlapping interest as well. Mr. Musk has broached the subject of the nation’s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with Mr. Trump, according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions.

Mr. Musk has advocated a so-called smart grid and has said that eventually Tesla will offer grid services, such as batteries that can be added to the grid and paired with solar and wind farms. This is the kind of high-impact infrastructure project that Mr. Trump has supported.

And Tesla’s success could help fend off Chinese efforts to compete or even dominate in what could be an important piece of the car industry’s future."

Elon Musk famously spends his working life between two major projects.

Part of the week, he’s in Fremont, just over the bay from San Francisco in northern California fulfilling his role as CEO of Tesla, the pioneering electric automotive manufacturer. The rest of the time, Musk – who, is known for working hours that few people could stomach – heads south to Los Angeles and the headquarters of SpaceX, located close to the city’s airport.

Given their momentous ambitions, guiding organisations that are trying, respectively, to move transportation from carbon-based models, and developing the world’s leading, private space transportation company, might appear to be time-consuming pursuits. But, the Stanford physics dropout has numerous other interests, including saving humanity from weaponised artificial intelligence, colonising Mars and – because we’re going to need to get a lot of stuff delivered to the Red Planet – investment in a payments platform that powers large parts of the digital economy. His assertion at a conference in California last year, that we’re living inside a computer simulation may explain his super-human productivity.

Here, a list of some of ways Musk fills his time when he’s not tinkering with technology. Please let us know if we’ve missed any out.

CEO of The Boring Company

After tweeting he was fed up with the traffic in Los Angeles, Musk said he wanted to solve the problems with tunnels. And so, The Boring Company was born. On the firm's site, The Boring Company explains: ""To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won't fall on your head.""The Boring Company plans to build a large network of tunnels ""many levels deep"" to fix congestion in various US cities, starting with LA.

Chairman of SolarCity

Founded in 2006 by Musk’s cousin’s Lyndon and Peter Rive – who serves as the company’s COO and CTO – SolarCity is one of the largest producers of solar panels in the world. Purchased by Tesla for $2bn in November 2016, SolarCity recently opened its so-called Gigafactory, near Buffalo, New York; the plant will produce 10,000 panels per day. Producing solar energy is one thing, but it’s useless unless it can be stored. With this in mind, in October last year, Tesla announced the Powerwall 2.0 a new version of its rechargeable lithium ion battery for homes and small businesses. Musk’s company has an interest in the entire energy cycle, from production to consumption.

SpaceX

SpaceX aims to send astronauts to the ISS as an operations test, before the launch of its first commercial flight. The Dragon rocket will take off from the Kennedy Space Center's Space Launch System in Florida, after Nasa awarded the company contracts in September 2014 to complete the spacecraft

When the space craft Falcon 9 launched and then landed on April 8 2016, it was a significant milestone in the development of Musk’s aerospace organisation, SpaceX. Founded in 2002, the company built the first privately developed, liquid-fuelled rocket to orbit Earth and has the ambition to be one of the leading organisations moving the space industry from being the domain of nation states to private companies. In 2012, as part of two contracts with Nasa to deliver cargo to the ISS that total $5.7 billion, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft was the first commercial company to move cargo between Earth and the International Space Station.

There are no links and no contact details. Like tech billionaires Bill Gates and Marc Zuckerberg, Musk has signed the Giving Pledge, promising to donate the majority of his wealth to philanthropy.

Google DeepMind and Vicarious

Musk is concerned about the potential negative consequences of artificial intelligence, telling CNBC that he was an early stage investor in London-based DeepMind not to make money, but “to keep an eye on what’s going on with artificial intelligence”. Musk has also invested in San Francisco’s Vicarious, which, according to its website, “is trying to achieve human-level intelligence in vision, language and motor control”. Along with investors Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel, and Y Combinator’s Sam Altman, Musk is a founder of OpenAI, which is seeking to develop artificial intelligence that benefits rather than harms humanity.

Tesla

It’s widely assumed Musk was the founder of Tesla. In fact, the company was founded by engineer Martin Eberhard and computer scientist Marc Tarpenning in July 2003 – Musk joined the board in 2004 after leading the company’s series A funding, and became CEO in 2008. The announcement of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, in April 2016, excited consumers to such an extent that purchasers were willing to put down $1,000 despite not being likely to receive the car for two years.

Neuralink

Musk’s latest venture, brain-computer interface company Neuralink could be his most ambitious to date. And that’s saying a lot, coming from the man that wants to colonise Mars. Revealed in March 2017 by the Wall Street Journal, it wants to create a system that allows humans to seamlessly communicate with technology without the need for an actual, physical interface. In an April 2017 interview Musk, revealed he would be CEO of Neuralink and that the company is trying to turn cloud-based AI into an extension of the human brain. Within four years, he aims to create a system that will lead to humans communicating by a system of ""consensual telepathy"". The company is registered as a medical research entity because its initial focus will be on using the interface to help with the symptoms of chronic conditions, from epilepsy to depression.

Surrey Satellite Technology

The Guilford-based company, makes small, inexpensive satellites. Musk is reported to have taken a 10 per cent stake in the company in 2004.

NeuroVigil

The Moffett Field, California-based startup develops products that monitor brain signals. Musk became the principle investor in May 2015. As well as clinical applications, the company is researching uses for its products in space.

The critics seem to love it, and Tesla management says it’s already received deposits for 500,000 of the vehicles. Perhaps now Elon Musk can finally get his hand out of U.S. taxpayers’ wallets?

Musk is, to be sure, an ideas man. Private, commercial space travel? Check. Washington to New York in less than half an hour in what he calls a “hyperloop” train that will travel at 800 miles per hour? Check. A new kind of tunneling engineering? Check. Solar energy? Check. Electric cars? Check, check.

As wide-ranging as these various entrepreneurial ventures may be, they all have one thing in common – not a single one of them would get funding in a competitive private capital market if it weren’t for massive (and I do mean massive) taxpayer-funded government subsidies.

ADVERTISEMENT

A study published two years ago by The Los Angeles Times revealed that just three of Musk’s ventures – SolarCity Corp. (which manufactured and installed solar energy systems before its 2016 merger with Tesla Motors Inc.), Tesla Motors Inc. (which manufactures electric vehicles), and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX (which builds rocket ships) – had received $4.9 billion in government subsidies to that point in time. By now, Musk’s various ventures have sucked well over $5 billion from government coffers.

But granting literally billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to Musk’s firms isn’t the worst of it. No, that honorific is reserved for this little gem: In order to induce car buyers to spend their money on electric vehicles, the federal government offers a $7,500 rebate on the purchase price.

Some states enhance that rebate with rebates of their own. In California, for instance, purchasers of electric vehicles get a state-funded rebate of $2,500 more.

There’s a phrase for that – it’s called “crony capitalism.” And it stinks.

Crony capitalism relies on government picking winners and losers. It depends on government choosing to move resources to a favored enterprise, even as it refuses to move resources to disfavored enterprises.

As such, it adds a political aspect to the economic criteria of the investment financing decision-making matrix. Those who can curry favor with key government officials have another avenue of funding available to them that those who cannot curry such favor do not.

By definition, that distorts the marketplace, and warps investment decisions better made by private stewards of finance unencumbered by political considerations, whose only fiduciary responsibility is to those whose funds they manage. By adding the political calculus to the decision-making matrix, it alters outcomes, and prevents the most economically efficient deployment of limited financial resources.

That’s all fancy economic professor talk I learned in college.

Here’s the question I hear when I’m talking to friends in Georgia who ask me to explain Washington to them: “Why should those guys in Washington take my hard-earned tax dollars and use them to lower the price of an electric car for some movie star in Hollywood?”

That’s a good question. Given that the average household income of a Tesla Model X owner is $503,000, that the average household income of a Tesla Model S owner is $267,000, and that we can only assume the average household income of a Model 3 owner will be somewhere in six-figure territory, it’s a tough question to answer.

If Leonardo DiCaprio – who commands $20 million per movie (and there’s nothing at all wrong with that, if Hollywood studios think he’s worth the investment) – wants to buy a Tesla electric car, more power to him. But he certainly doesn’t need to be taking money out of the pockets of middle-income people elsewhere to do it. He can afford it on his own.

So that’s why I’m hoping Tesla’s Model 3 is a yuuuuuuuuge hit. I hope Elon Musk sells enough of those cars that he can make a profit on his own, without needing to dip any further into our pocketbooks and wallets.

Maybe then we could actually get a tax cut, and get some of our money back, so we can make our own choices about how best to spend them, rather than letting bureaucrats and politicians in Washington make those decisions for us.

President Trump, are you listening?"

Tesla • Elon Musk is both an autodidact and a didact at heart.

• This might sound like an annoying tendency, but he's so good at it that it isn't.

• Few CEOs are willing to educate their audiences in this way.

If you go to the website of most automakers, you'll see what you expect to see: cars, in all their shiny glory.

If you go to the Tesla website and investigate the company's newest car, you'll see the vehicle in all its shiny glory, but you will also see the graph to the right.

It's an S-curve, and it describes Tesla's anticipated production ramp for the Model 3: slow at first, then exponentially increasing until it levels off once full production is achieved.

CEO Elon Musk has been talking about the S-curve a lot lately, and especially after he admitted that Tesla would endure ""production hell"" for at least the first six months of manufacturing. This isn't really a typical thing for a big-time celebrity CEO to be getting into, but it is an example of a peculiar and, I think, engaging tendency that Elon has. I call it ""Musksplaining.""

An autodidact's autodidact

Teacher Elon. OnInnovation/Flickr

Some people think Musk is a genius. I'm not sure about that, but he is certainly one of humanity's most accomplished autodidacts: he has taught himself automotive engineering, rocket science, and solar design. Because he's an autodidact, he's also a didact — he likes to explain what's he's learned and knows to others.

""Splaining,"" in its contemporary incarnation (""mansplaining"" to women, most infamously), has a bad rap, and rightly so. But Musksplaining is actually completely endearing. Most quarterly earnings calls are incredibly dull, but Musk often Musksplains all kinds of stuff when answering analysts' questions, making Tesla's earnings calls must-listen experiences.

The S-curve Musksplainer is just the latest instance. A few years ago, on a call, Musk explained vertical integration — the manufacturing process by which most processes are handled in-house. In the heyday of Ford, for example, the River Rouge plant was so vertically integrated that train cars full of iron ore rolled up to one end and finished cars rolled out the other. The auto industry has moved away from vertical integration, but Musk wants to bring it back.

Musk also doesn't Musksplain just Tesla's business. He's equally willing to fill you in on carbon taxes and artificial intelligence ( his row with Mark Zuckerberg over AI's potential threats being just the latest example of that Musksplainer).

Fission vs. fusion

The Musksplainer at work. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images

My personal favorite recent Musksplainer occurred when he and Y Combinator Sam Altman sat down to talk with Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times and the conversation turned to the potential for nuclear power. Sorkin, a pretty smart guy, revealed a lacuna of his own knowledge when he seemed to confuse the nuclear fission and fusion reactions.

It was the perfect set-up for a classic Musksplaining session, as Elon succinctly laid out what's hard about fusion and why its been such an elusive source of power (it's hard to sustain the reaction, keeping the fire from going out, Musk said, offering the example of Sun — a huge fusion reactor with its own gravitation containment — as the best example and explaining that similar electromagnetic containment is very hard to achieve on Earth).

Sorkin didn't really look embarrassed, and why would he? Musk had served up a nice piece of education, in terms anybody could understand.

There have been some cases where Musksplaining was a bit elliptical and not as successful; I've been puzzling for while over a connection he once drew between the rocket equation and Tesla's ambitious for automating car manufacturing. But I think he hasn't Musksplained it yet because he hasn't figured out an accessible way to do it.

Basically, it means that a rocket accelerates as it burns fuel because it sheds the weight of that fuel. Applied to manufacturing, I think Musk's analogy involves the vehicle-assembly process rapidly accelerating as it sheds extraneous or inefficient steps through enhanced automation.

Musk the educator

Disney CEO Bob Iger is a great executive, but not an explainer. Getty

When I was in Los Angeles, working as a radio reporter, I officially reported on the financials of just one company: Disney. This meant I got to listen to CEO Bob Iger do his thing every quarter. Iger is an accomplished CEO, but he's right out of central casting — he does nothing odd, ever, when speaking to the investment community. This is reassuring — aspiring CEOs can take CEO lessons from Iger's performances — but it isn't very entertaining.

And you don't expect to actually learn anything new from Iger. With Musk, you learn new things all the time or you at least get a better angle on stuff you thought you knew but never really had a complete understanding of.

I've covered Tesla for a long time, but I still get excited every time I sense a good Musksplaining about to happen. Musk is one of the brainiest people to ever lead several companies. We probably has no idea of the educational fun in store for us if SpaceX ever goes public and we get to listen to Musk lucidly and cheerfully walk us through the intricacies of rocket science.

So yes, ""splaining"" is generally annoying. But Musk, as with so many things, flips it on its head and makes it worth everybody's while."

Millions of Puerto Ricans are living in the dark at home after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island, knocking out its already fragile electric grid. Two weeks later, only 9% of residents have electricity, according to Puerto Rican government figures.

Musk, the CEO of electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA), suggested his company's solar power unit could be a long-term solution.

""The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico,"" Musk tweeted Thursday morning, adding that the decision is up to Puerto Rican government officials.

""@elonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project,"" Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló tweeted Thursday night.

A Tesla-powered system would be a complete reversal for Puerto Rico's energy grid. Right now, the island imports and burns oil to generate electricity.

Under that antiquated system, ordinary Puerto Ricans have been paying exorbitantly high electric bills for years. Several told CNNMoney this week that a monthly electric bill can easily go for $250.

Can Elon Musk bring power to Puerto Rico?

The island is still left without any working infrastructure after taking a pummeling from Hurricane Maria, raising the question of whether its antiquated power grid could use a full reboot.

Enter Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who said on Twitter Thursday that his company's team had brought power to smaller islands using solar tech, and that it could be done in Puerto Rico too. But he noted it was up to the Puerto Rican government, public utilities, commercial stakeholders and its people.

That drew the interest of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who responded, ""Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project.""

@elonMusk Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project. https://t.co/McnHKwisqc — Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 6, 2017

Tesla recently absorbed one of Musk’s other companies, SolarCity, which manufactures residential solar roofs and energy storage units. The company has been exploring ways to scale up its battery storage projects. A Twitter bet between Musk and an Australian software entrepreneur ultimately led to plans for the world’s largest lithium-ion battery facility in South Australia. The plant, which will cost $50 million, could provide electricity to more than 30,000 homes.

Musk has been known to offhandedly propose huge projects on Twitter, and occasionally he’s been known to follow through. His idea to speed up the tunnel boring process resulted in the creation of a new company and the green light to dig a two-mile tunnel under Los Angeles.

So the question is whether Musk will follow up with Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello about his offer to rebuild the island’s power grid. And if so, what would a Tesla-backed solar power project on the still-recovering island look like. The company says it has powered small islands, such as Ta'u in American Samoa. There, it installed a solar grid which can power the entire island and store enough electricity for three days without any sun. (The Verge reached out to Musk with some follow-up questions, and we’ll update this story if we hear back.)

The company is also working with residents on Kauai in the Hawaiian islands to find better ways to produce and — most importantly — store solar energy, so that it can reliably power homes on days when the sun may not be shining. In March, Tesla cut the ribbon on a grid-scale battery installation on the island, a key test of the viability of energy storage in making renewable energy a more reliable part of the grid."

Tighter collaboration between Elon Musk's two largest companies could help Tesla fend off competition and access capital while allowing both companies to share resources and information and collaborate on new businesses, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note sent Tuesday.

To be sure, there are no stated plans to merge the two companies. But Musk and other Tesla executives have said SpaceX and Tesla have worked together in the past.

Strategic partnerships, shared technology, or even a combination of the two companies are ways the two companies could become more intertwined, Jonas said.

One reason it may make sense for Tesla to collaborate more or even combine with SpaceX is that it may become increasingly difficult for Tesla to continue as an independent company, Jonas said.

For example, the company could soon face stiff competition from established automakers and deep-pocketed tech firms. Large tech firms in particular will have ""arguably superior access to capital, talent and business models that can monetize vehicle data and content opportunities,"" he said.

Tesla already has intense capital needs. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said he expects the company to burn $4.7 billion in 2017 alone, as the company expands production on the Model 3 and invests in other businesses.

But there seems to be no ""apparent natural buyer"" for Tesla, Jonas said. The capital intensity of Tesla's business and other economic and political factors, such as barriers to foreign ownership, leave few likely candidates.

But a tighter relationship with SpaceX could allow the companies to share resources, and perhaps offer Tesla access to capital. SpaceX bought some of SolarCity's debt before Tesla purchased the solar power company. SpaceX's launch business appears to be in a ""highly dominant position,"" according to Jonas' models, and the company looks well-positioned to enter ""highly profitable"" markets, such as proprietary satellite broadband.

Musk already divides his time between the two companies, and he may further reduce his time at Tesla to focus on SpaceX. This poses a risk for Tesla as many investors consider Musk to be essential."

Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, came up with the idea of the Boring Company in December after he tweeted that traffic was driving him ""nuts"". His vision is to build a series of tunnels underground that will be able to ferry people and cars without traffic jams. The car isn't actually being driven in the tunnels. Instead, it sits on a pod which carries it through the network.

But in order to go underground, a car will need an elevator. Last month, Musk said that the first elevator is nearly fully operational and on Wednesday via Instagram, he showed off the concept, with a Tesla car (of course).

The car drives onto a surface which is then lowered into the tunnel to join the network of tunnels."

""If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be,"" Musk recently tweeted.

Jenny Dearborn, chief learning officer at software solutions company SAP, agrees.

In fact, she says it's critical to educate ourselves on artificial intelligence and how to best use it.

""Artificial intelligence will be everywhere,"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""It will be the most prevalent aspect of our society that won't be visibly seen. But it will be behind everything.""

She says it will impact everything we do, including scanning badges, scrolling the internet, using apps and home sensor systems and many other facets of daily living. As a result, AI will constantly collect data and personal information. Companies can then take this info and apply algorithms to get a sense of your behavior, explains Dearborn.

""We need to use artificial intelligence to augment people, not replace them,"" she says. ""And we need more people to have a voice in how we use that so we aren't being taken advantage of.""

But who would be taking advantage of us and why should we care? Dearborn says that there are three companies at the forefront of artificial intelligence: Google, Facebook and . They ""have the most to gain,"" she says.

""People need to be savvy as to their participation so they don't wake up one day and say, 'I've been a pawn,'"" says Dearborn.

She uses health trackers, such as Fitbit, as an example: A health-care company could decide to use the data provided by fitness apps to learn more about people's health habits. ""Then what if one day it decides to increase premiums for people who walk less than 10,000 steps per day?"" she says."

Now, Musk has reclaimed a bit of that internet history for himself by purchasing the defunct domain name X.com from his former employer PayPal, which confirmed the purchase to Business Insider after internet domain blog Domain Investing reported on the purchase earlier today. ""We are delighted to sell the domain X.com back to its previous owner, Elon Musk,"" a PayPal spokesperson said in a statement given to BI.

X.com has a storied internet history behind it

To understand the significance of the URL, you have to dial all the way back to 2000, when Musk’s online financial services company X.com merged with Confinity, which at the time operated a little-known money transfer service called PayPal. Confinity was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, now notable internet entrepreneurs and investors — Thiel became a billionaire by investing early in Facebook, while Levchin went on to help found Yelp and currently operates a digital loan service called Affirm.

Back when the two companies merged, it was decided by investors and board members that X.com had more brand recognition than Confinity. However, the entire company was rebranded as PayPal in 2001, a year after Musk left the company over disagreements with other executive members. But PayPal later went public and got scooped up by Ebay for $1.5 billion in 2002, netting Musk somewhere in the range of $160 to $180 million after taxes.

Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back https://t.co/bOUOejO16Y! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 11, 2017

Fast forward a decade and a half — and three multi-billion-dollar enterprises in the electric car, solar energy, and space transport industries later — and Musk is now one of the most successful entrepreneurs on the planet. With a net worth of more than $15.3 billion thanks to his holdings in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, Musk can purchase whatever he likes, including defunct domain names.

X.com likely didn’t come for cheap, though PayPal isn’t saying just how much Musk paid and Musk hasn’t disclosed what he plans to do with it. But his car company does have a Model X, and the name did clearly influence how he branded his space venture back in 2002. So we’ll see if the URL gets used for something car or rocket-related in the future."

His plan is to send the first humans to Mars in 2024 to build the foundations for the first Martian city. But is Mars really the best place for humans to settle?

Some scientists, like Amanda Hendrix believes we should be looking somewhere else like Titan, a moon slightly bigger than our own that orbits Saturn. Following is a transcript of the video.

Amanda Hendrix: First of all, I don't want to be negative about Mars. I like Mars, I do think we should go there. Humans should go there to visit and check it out and do science. I just don't think it's a good place for living for long-term. And the main reason is because of the radiation problem and Mars offers no natural protection against galactic cosmic rays. It has a thin atmosphere and no magnetosphere so humans who intend to spend any long period in Mars are probably going to have to live underground or in some sort of devices that can shield them from the galactic cosmic rays.

Titan, on the other hand, has got this natural shielding device, which is its nice thick atmosphere.Titan is really unique because it's a moon and it has a solid surface, it's mostly an icy moon but it has this thick atmosphere and it's unique because there's no other moon in the solar system that has such an atmosphere. The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen. It's about 1 to 2% methane. So, one thing to point out is there's no oxygen in the atmosphere like we have on Earth. And so, humans living in Titan making oxygen to breathe shouldn't be a problem because there's plenty of H²O frozen in the surface and in the sub-surface. So humans could derive oxygen to breathe without a big problem.

Perhaps a good option might be to try out a temporary, short-term colony of humans on Mars and use that as a stepping stone to Titan, use it as kind of a practice run. I think that will be a great idea. But somebody like Elon Musk who has the smarts to be able to work on Titan and make a colony there happen, and make the propulsion system happen, I think that he should be thinking about Titan more than Mars."

At around age nine, when he ran out of titles to read at his school's library, he pored through the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, according to Bloomberg. That's around 32,000 pages. Perhaps it's no surprise then that the SpaceX and Tesla CEO has read countless textbooks on rocket science and physics over his career. In fact, it's reported that his self-teaching method taught him about space exploration. Maybe more unexpected? Fiction also plays a significant role in Musk's life. Here are the two novels that shaped the billionaire tech leader.

""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding

Golding's classic novel on survival and competition left its mark on Musk. The interplay between two of the book's main characters likely shaped his life's mission: to save mankind.

""The heroes of the books I read ... always felt a duty to save the world,"" he tells The New Yorker. Ralph, one of the English boys on the remote island where ""Lord of the Flies"" takes place, wants to create moral and ethical codes to save humanity. Meanwhile the book's antagonist, Jack, initially just rebellious, finds himself consumed by power and greed. Their struggle is a cautionary tale about what can happen when men are left to their own devices. The book shaped Musk's worldview on his own future. For instance, he has publicly spoken about the dangers of artificial intelligence in the hands of humans. In an open letter, he's writes that people should ""be worried.""

""Foundation"" by Isaac Asimov

The first of Asimov's science fiction trilogy, ""Foundation"" explores humanity at a crossroads. In the story, one man tries to save the world from a fast-approaching descent into ignorance and warfare by creating an alternate empire. The universe he creates, called ""Foundation,"" is a place where science, technology and the arts provide refuge to people. But only if the protagonist can successfully protect it. Asimov's books taught Musk that ""civilizations move in cycles,"" according to a 2013 interview with The Guardian. That lesson encouraged the entrepreneur to pursue his radical ambitions.

""Given that this is the first time in 4.5 billion years where it's been possible for humanity to extend life beyond Earth,"" he says, ""it seems like we'd be wise to act while the window was open and not count on the fact it will be open a long time."" ""We're obviously in a very upward cycle right now and hopefully that remains the case,"" he says. ""But it may not."" These two dramatic books share multiple themes — chief among them that an individual can have a huge impact on the world. And when Musk wasn't pondering the future of mankind as a young man or studying books about space, he also made time for lighter reading. ""I read a lot of comics,"" he tells entrepreneur Kevin Rose. ""I read every comic in the store. If there was a comic on the rack, I read it."" Check out the key lessons from one of Musk's favorite biographies."

Losers are the electric car industry and producers of wind power and other clean energy.

Winners include oil and gas and the nuclear power industry, which would see tax breaks preserved.

The bill's release Thursday alarmed automobile manufacturers such as electric car maker Tesla, and environmentalists howled over the loss of tax credits for renewable energy production, which would produce billions of dollars to help pay for corporate tax cuts elsewhere in the measure.

""It's a dirty tax deal for dirty energy,"" said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. ""Trump's tax bill is a clear assault on renewable energy including wind, electric vehicles, and solar power. While keeping the bulk of tax credits for the oil and other fossil fuel industries, the bill would cut important credits for green fuels.""

The measure would repeal a tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in electric vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3 and Chevrolet Bolt. Electric cars comprise just about 1 percent of sales nationwide, but several states have mandates that such ""zero emission vehicles"" make up a much larger portion of vehicle sales. Manufacturers worry that eliminating the lucrative tax credit would make meeting those targets virtually impossible.

The measure also would scale back a tax credit on wind energy that's popular with some Republicans, including powerful Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who promised to defend it.

The wind industry currently benefits from a 2.3 cent-per-kilowatt hours production credit; the measure would cut that back to 1.5 cents. The measure also ends the 10 percent tax credit for large-scale solar energy projects after 10 years and imposes a more aggressive timeline for solar projects to qualify for a 30 percent tax credit.

The GOP measure ends modest tax breaks for oil and gas, including a credit for low-producing oil and gas wells. But a lucrative tax break for drilling costs and special oil and gas industry accounting rules would be preserved, and a $6 billion tax break for nuclear power plant construction would be extended as well in a victory for a nuclear power plant project in Georgia by the Southern Company.

The president of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack Gerard, said the bill ""took a bold step to modernize the nation's tax code to sustain U.S. economic growth, spur strong energy investment, and create American jobs.""

Democrats objected to the measure, which also scales back a tax credit for homeowners who install solar panels on their residences. ""We should just maybe figure out a way to burn coal in cars and that would make them happy,"" said a sarcastic Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore."

DxOMark, the testing outfit many look to for fair evaluations of cameras from DSLRs to phones, gave Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 a 94, tying the iPhone and in some ways exceeding it.

While its video is merely great and its background-blur algorithms unreliable, the Samsung gained on its competition with its outstanding detail and color in everyday settings and super-fast autofocus. Its zoom also outperformed the iPhone’s.

Low-light photos also showed less noise and more detail than its rivals, though HDR mode tended to clip highlights and highly backlit subjects didn’t turn out well. But we all know better than to shoot in a dark room against a bright window, right?

Of course, a lot depends on what you want the camera for, whether you need this or that mode, and, most importantly, whether you’d ever switch from iOS to Android, or vice versa.

But with a class-leading camera and display, the Note 8 is certainly a good bet if you’re deep into the mobile photography game. But with the Pixel 2 right around the corner, you might want to hold onto your wallet for just a little longer."

Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Tesla is holding a shin-ding late Friday to commemorate the start of Model 3 deliveries — and it marks a huge milestone in Tesla's history as a company.

In 2006, Elon Musk typed up his very first "" Master Plan"" for an electric automaker that had yet to produce its first vehicle. Musk wasn't CEO at the time, but was overseeing initial production for Tesla's Roadster, a battery-powered sports car that the company has since discontinued.

""As you know, the initial product of Tesla Motors is a high performance electric sports car called the Tesla Roadster,"" Musk wrote at the time. ""However, some readers may not be aware of the fact that our long term plan is to build a wide range of models, including affordably priced family cars.""

Although it was short lived, the Roadster was a critical car for Tesla.

It raised the profile for then-nascent, electric vehicle technology and opened the door for other successful entries in the market, like the Nissan Leaf and Volkswagen e-Golf.

Although companies like General Motors and Toyota were researching electric cars before the Roadster's launch, Tesla was the first to show battery-powered cars weren't just garage projects: they could be sexy and fun.

Many may not realize that the Roadster was always designed with the Model 3 in mind — even if the Model 3 was still a concept rather than a physical product.

""Without giving away too much, I can say that the second model will be a sporty four door family car at roughly half the $89k price point of the Tesla Roadster and the third model will be even more affordable,"" Musk said in his 2006 plan.

Musk charted off course slightly by launching two luxury vehicles, the Model S and Model X, before the Model 3. The Model 3, however, will come in at $35,000 — under that $45,000 price tag Musk promised over a decade ago.

Tesla faces a slew of challenges going forward, but Friday's event celebrates a dream that was 10 years in the making. Through an economic downturn and "" production hell,"" Tesla came out on the other side and built its first affordable car."

In 2014, a handful of former employees claiming unfair compensation brought suits against SpaceX that California courts joined into one class action lawsuit. The company agreed to settle in August 2016 and finalized a settlement for about $4 million in May , according to Inverse. Although one of the litigants sought to block the settlement, he lost.

Silicon Valley workers are famously well-compensated: At Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and numerous other tech companies, even interns . But two of America's hottest companies are conspicuously absent from the list of the country's : Tesla, in Palo Alto, Calif., and SpaceX, in Hawthorne, Calif., both run by billionaire Elon Musk.

A SpaceX rocket sits on launch pad 39A as it is prepared for the NROL-76 launch on April 29, 2017 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Roughly 4,000 current and former employees had the option of participating, and each one who did will get about $500 or as much as $2,000. Their lawyers, meanwhile, will walk away with $1.3 million.

Inverse explains:

California law requires rest periods for employees every four hours, along with breaks for meals. SpaceX's shifts were designed such that workers couldn't take these breaks, but were also not paid more for working these hours instead of resting.

Legal blog Law360 goes into more detail about the original complaints:

In April 2015, named plaintiff Sebring Whitaker filed his own suit, also alleging that SpaceX didn't adequately pay him and similar nonexempt employees for normal and overtime work and didn't adequately provide required meal and rest breaks.



And in October, named plaintiff Stan Saporito filed his own suit alleging the company doesn't provide enough labor hours to its workers for everything that needs to get done, then requires them to work off the clock to finish tasks.

It's doubtful that a $4 million payout will compel Musk to change much about how he runs his businesses. But at some point the market might do that for him. If he continues to pay his SpaceX interns only half of what Facebook does — about $4,000 a month as compared to the $8,000 a month Zuckerberg's most junior employees make, according to the anonymous employer ranking site Glassdoor — he could lose talented prospects to companies in Silicon Valley.

Indeed, a full-time SpaceX employee, who enthuses about the ""dynamic work,"" ""great people"" and benefits on Glassdoor, mentions ""base salary"" as a drawback, saying it ""could be more competitive.""

But the allure of working for one of the boldest and most cutting-edge employers in the world remains. The company made Glassdoor's 2017 list of the Best Places to Work. SpaceX has a positive 4.4 rating out of 5 on the site, and its CEO has an approval rating of 98 percent. As one SpaceX intern writes, ""Everyone is a fanboy and Musk's word is law.""

The Red Planet has long been a source of study and speculation. Science fiction stories have inspired scientists and the general public to learn more about the world. Recently, Elon Musk, founder of the private space exploration firm SpaceX, has proposed an ambitious manned mission to Mars that could depart as early as 2022 though he has not fully explained overcoming the technical and financial obstacles.



The need-to-know facts about Mars exploration:



1. In the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, NASA studied possible manned missions to Mars and even proposed manned missions that would have taken place possibly between 1981 and 1986. Funding cuts, however, cancelled the plans in favor of the space shuttle and space station programs.



2. NASA projects that it could take astronauts more than a year to even reach Mars and as long to return and would be prone to problems due to long-term weightlessness and threats from solar radiation.



3. The first satellite to reach Mars was the NASA probe Mariner 4, which was launched in 1974 and flew by the planet in July 1965, taking the first pictures of another planet from space.



4. Mariner 9 was the first satellite to orbit Mars, arriving in November 1971 and sending information back to Earth until October 1972.



5. The first craft to land on Mars was the Soviet probe Mars 3 in December 1971, but it failed seconds after landing.



6. The first American landers on Mars were the Viking 1 and Viking 2 probes, both arriving in 1976. The Viking lander experiments searching for signs of life displayed unusual results but no clear signs of life, either present or past.



7. NASA robotic rovers first landed on Mars in 1997 (four altogether: Sojourner (1997), Spirit (2004), Opportunity (2004), and Curiosity (2011)) and have discovered that water ice exists beneath the Martian surface and that the planet could have supported some form of life many millions of years ago.



8. NASA has proposed future missions to Mars that include a possible sample-return mission in the late 2020s and even a possible manned mission sometime in the 2030s, pending spacecraft design studies and funding.



9. For amateur astronomers, the most popular form of the exploration of space, Mars will be visible in the night sky in October, appearing in the northern hemisphere as a bright red star in the southwest in the early nighttime hours.

https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/snapchat-2016-company-of-the-year-nominee.html,pos,1.0,7.684345710162118e-17,How Snapchat Made Its Competition Disappear in 2016,2016-11-01 05:45:00,2019-06-25 16:05:12.912756,Staff Writer,"UPDATE: Snapchat has reportedly filed for an IPO that put its valuation in the range of $25 billion.

Editor's Note: Inc. Magazine announced its pick for Company of the Year on Tuesday, November 29. It's Riot Games! Here, we spotlight Snapchat, one of the contenders for the title in 2016.

Five years ago, if you had told Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy that they'd be running a company valued at $20 billion today, they wouldn't think you were crazy. They might even say, ""well, duh.""

You see, Spiegel and Murphy were just college students in 2011 when they came up with the idea for Snap, the company formerly known as Snapchat. At the time, the two fraternity brothers at Stanford University developed a disappearing messages app--which they dubbed ""Picaboo""--for a class project. The response from the class was tepid at best, but Spiegel and Murphy were undeterred.

Today, the Venice, California-based company has evolved--rapidly--into a hub for news, entertainment, and social networking. Not only have the likes of Barack Obama and DJ Khaled joined the chorus of 150 million daily active Snapchat users around the world, the company is also poised to go public early next year. It's reportedly seeking to raise as much as $4 billion in the IPO, which could value Snap at as much as $35 billion.

A Banner Year

This year, Snapchat surpassed rivals Twitter and Pinterest to become the fastest-growing social media company in the U.S., with users sending 9,000 Snaps per second, according to its own data. The company claims that users watch more than 10 billion videos on the app each day. (For reference, Facebook, the reigning social media champ, reported in November 2015 that users watch around eight billion videos on the network each day. Though, that figure is likely higher now.)

Also, this year, the company started to capitalize on its Discover feature, which kicked off in 2015. It scored a series of deals with major publishers, including NBC and The Wall Street Journal, as well as with sports leagues like the NFL. These companies publish content on their own Snapchat channels, typically short video segments that disappear after 24 hours.

Snapchat saw its top line grow, exponentially. Digital-marketing researcher eMarketer estimates that U.S. advertisers will spend a whopping $384.4 million on Snapchat advertising by the end of 2016, and as much as $804.5 million in 2017. That's more than six times Snapchat's original target of $50 million last year, according to tech news site Recode.

A majority of the company's sales come through video advertisements on user-generated ""Stories"" and Discover content, though the company also makes money through sponsored lenses and filters. And starting this fall, Snap plans to start peddling its first-ever hardware product--a pair of camera glasses called Spectacles that it intends to sell for $130 apiece. Snap unveiled the new device in September.

Fast Forward

And while the company is well-known for its appeal to Millennials--a desirable market for advertisers--there's still room to grow. On any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S., according to 2015 Nielsen data.

Building out partnerships with dozens of publishers on the Discover platform has been key to expanding Snapchat's audience. It recently redesigned the feature, so publisher and user-generated stories are now presented together. It's also moving away from its current revenue sharing model, offering to pay media partners up front instead. The change could dissuade some publishers from coming on board, inasmuch as they would have less control over how their content is sold.

Even so, the number of Snapchat users in the U.S. is estimated to increase by nearly 14 percent in 2017, according to eMarketer data.

The challenge moving forward will be continuing to attract mobile users amid strong competition for Millennial eyeballs. And while Snapchat may be the fastest-growing social media company, its audience is small potatoes compared with Facebook's 1.7 billion daily active users and Instagram's roughly 500 million. Instagram recently unveiled its own ""Stories"" feature, which has the potential to steal users from Snapchat.

Analysts point out that the challenge for social media companies, including Facebook and Snapchat, will be continuing to get individual users to generate content at the same rate that advertisers want to sell. ""For Snapchat, that's even more critical, because people are spending a significant amount of time on the platform,"" says Cathy Boyle, a senior principal analyst with eMarketer.

By jumping into a pod that levitates and travels through a tube at 750 miles per hour, of course.

It’s called a Hyperloop system, and more than 100 Arizona students have worked for months to bring the concept closer to reality.

SpaceX, the aerospace company led by Elon Musk, developed the high-speed Hyperloop technology and launched a competition to see who could accelerate its development, according to the company’s website.

Arizona State University students participated in the first competition – aimed at building a high-speed pod – but the team didn’t make the final cut.

Undeterred, the students combined efforts with other Arizona schools, including Thunderbird School of Global Management, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Northern Arizona University, according to AZLoop’s website.

The volunteers often spend Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights – and sometimes until the morning – inventing strategies to improve their pod at a 3,000-square foot lab space on ASU’s Polytechnic campus.

They plan to compete in the next competition this summer. This one’s focused on one thing: maximum speed.

Co-Lead Director Lynne Nethken describes the pod as an airplane without wings that can hold about 26 to 28 people.

“We have traffic problems just like everywhere else, and so we want to try and see what we can do to not only alleviate some of the traffic problems that we have, but to create a sustainable solution,” she said.

Co-Lead Director Joshua Kozar said these students are creating something that will adapt a demand for people who travel.

“The innovation’s changing the world,” he said. “It’s being able to tell somebody that in 10 years, 20 years, they’ll be able to go to San Diego for lunch. They’ll be able to go to (Las) Vegas for lunch, spend half of their lunch hour gambling away their life savings.”

The AZLoop team is finishing its technical report to present to SpaceX. The company will hold the competition at its track in California."

The result was a crash of that market in 1637.

CME Group announced plans for bitcoin futures contracts earlier this week, a move that UBS analyst Paul Donovan has compared to the introduction of a similar product just before the tulip bubble burst in the 1600s.

The tulip craze in the Netherlands in the 17th century saw the price of the flower skyrocket. This resulted in a crash of that market in 1637.

In 1636, cash-settled futures were introduced in the tulip market. A futures contract is one where a buyer and seller will agree a price for a commodity that will be delivered on a certain date. This previously meant that the physical product had to be delivered. But cash-settled futures contracts allow cash to be delivered upon expiration.

This method was used during the tulip bubble and a year later in 1637, the market crashed.

The CME Group said earlier this week that it plans to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory review. Those futures will be based on cash settlement too.

Donovan, wealth management global chief economist at UBS, said: ""We've been here before.""

In a follow-up email to CNBC, Donovan explained the issues with the cash-settled futures contracts for tulips and how that compares to bitcoin.

""The idea of not physically delivering the product was rather shocking to contemporaries (as it turns out, the market crashed before bulbs could have been delivered anyway – bulbs were lifted in June 1637 for physical delivery). Traders met in groups (in taverns), called 'Colleges.' Think of the taverns as the cryptocurrency exchanges of their day,"" Donovan said.

UBS has been been one of the bearish voices on bitcoin. In a research paper published last month, the investment bank said that bitcoin is a ""speculative bubble"" and will never be a real currency.

Bitcoin has often been compared to the tulip craze. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called the cyrptocurrency a ""fraud"" and said ""it's worse than tulip bulbs"" and ""won't end well.""

The cryptocurrency continues to rally. On Thursday, bitcoin smashed through the $7,300 level to hit a new all-time high."
https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/05/technofascism-and-the-three-percent/,pos,1.0,6.810489244958187e-27,Technofascism and the three percent – TechCrunch,2017-02-05 00:00:00,2019-06-25 16:05:21.794661,Jon Evans,"Everywhere I look, I see the magic number: 3%. On the right, a whole quasi-militia movement is named that. On the left, activists report “it takes 3.5% of a population engaged in sustained nonviolent resistance to topple brutal dictatorships.” Nassim Taleb argues that once an intransigent minority reaches “3 or 4%” of the total population, the latter will “have to submit to their preferences.”

But it seems like everyone is intransigent now — and I believe technology has a lot to do with that.

The causality is pretty straightforward. Social media acts as a massive collective Sorting Hat, silently assigning most of us to filter bubbles wherein our beliefs and biases are rarely challenged. News (or “news”) sources rise up to cater to those filter bubbles, powered by tech’s ability to provide cheap global distribution to many millions to anyone with a blog and a knack for clickbait headlines.

Then, slowly, these isolated groups do what isolated groups do: bit by bit, degree by degree, they — and, especially, their attitudes towards other groups — become more extreme. Increasing extremity in one group provokes a backlash of counter-extremity in other groups, and the vicious downward spiral continues. Thanks, social media!

Obviously this doesn’t happen to everyone. But remember those links above: you only need 3% of a population to be intransigent activists to have a massive effect on society, on the scale of overthrowing entire governments. But the assumption there is that there’s only one hard-core 3% movement, versus a bland majority and a small oppressive cabal. What happens when we have two hardcore intransigent 3% movements? Or three? Or more?

What happens if and when one of them is fascist?

This seems like a good time to point out that both the right and the left claim they’re fighting fascism. Right-wingers in America and Europe claim the West is at war with fascist radical Islam in the form of ISIS/Daesh and other extremists — “Salafascists” to use Taleb’s term. (I am not suggesting that Taleb, who I consider one of our era’s great minds, can be categorized as either “left” or “right.”)

In their defense, Daesh does exist, and is unspeakably horrible, and does want to bury Western civilization. On the other hand, radical Islam is a laughably tiny minority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims, and is arguably fuelled mostly by oppressive Middle Eastern governments, many of which have, awkwardly, historically been supported by the West; Daesh is a weak faraway quasi-state on the verge of collapse; and despite a few awful successes, extremist Islamic terrorists have shown no ability to mount any kind of actual sustained assault on the values and institutions of the enormously wealthier and more powerful West, unless you count triggering massive overreactions.

But in a right-wing filter bubble, it’s apparently easy to be convinced that there are “no-go” Muslim-controlled regions throughout Europe, that a creeping takeover of Western institutions by Sharia law is already underway, that your local shopping mall may very well be under surveillance right now by planners of the next catastrophic terror attack, etc., even though none of these statements bears even the slightest tangential connection to reality. Thanks, social media!

That’s why the American left wing says they’re fighting fascists; they believe that this ridiculous, irrational fear is being deliberately stoked and used as a stalking horse for actual, outright, white-supremacy fascism of the National Socialist variety. And, I mean, it’s hard to look at Steve Bannon’s history of on-the-record statements and not find that a whole lot more convincing than the batshit “We must defend ourselves against Muslim refugees because many are ISIS agents planning to impose Sharia law on the West!” mindset.

(For context, my homeland Canada gladly took in 39,000 Syrian refugees last year, which is the rough equivalent of the USA bringing in 400,000. You may be surprised to learn that our Parliament has not yet been overthrown in favor of a caliphate.)

Regardless, both wings of the body politic are approaching their self-proclaimed battles against fascism in the same way: by trying to “no-platform” the enemy, i.e. prevent their views from being promulgated. That’s why west-coast left-wingers are shutting down the talks of professional troll Milo Yiannopoulos. That’s why Twitter is being sued by ISIS victims. The idea, in both cases, is that if fascism is given a platform, it will — or at least can — grow, and so, uniquely among ideologies, it must be shut down rather than outcompeted.

don't have a strong take but worth remembering the whole point of fascism is to leverage liberal tolerance to dissolve the liberal state — ryan cooper (@ryanlcooper) February 2, 2017

Taleb again:

people are disputing whether the freedom of the enlightened West can be undermined by the intrusive policies that would be needed to fight Salafi fundamentalists … can democracy –by definition the majority — tolerate enemies? The question is as follows: “Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?” Let’s go one step further, “Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?” We can answer these points using the minority rule. Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, as we saw, it will eventually destroy our world. So, we need to be more than intolerant with some intolerant minorities. It is not permissible to use “American values” or “Western principles” in treating intolerant Salafism (which denies other peoples’ right to have their own religion).

But no-platforming is a very twentieth-century strategy that simply doesn’t work any more. It was effective when platforms were hard to come by, before anyone with a compelling voice could turn a personal blog into a publication with tens of millions of readers (as Michael Arrington did with this very site, not long ago.) But you can’t no-platform your foes in a world where platform construction kits are given out free with every computer.

Breitbart is vastly more important to Yiannopoulos than a talk at Berkeley; indeed, the latter is just fodder for the former, courtesy of the Streisand Effect. ISIS/Daesh aren’t just canny enough to give a guided tour of their state to Vice; they’re hyperactive on social media and have their very own glossy, artfully designed propaganda magazines.

So what is to be done, in this brave new political world of multiple intransigent subgroups, multiple staunchly believed claims of fascism, and the ignoble failure of the anti-fascist tactics of the past? …I don’t pretend to know, but I suspect that, as is so often the case, technology can provide the solution to the problem it provoked. Regardless, it’s important to recognize that such is the world in which we now live."

Wired magazine cofounder Kevin Kelly predicts realistic, affordable virtual-reality sex will be with us in less than five years.

The digital guru and author, who now goes under the title “senior maverick” at Wired, said: “I’m sure that right now there are one or two places that have probably put this together.”

He added that the main hurdles virtual-reality sex will face will be economics — how to make it cheap enough for the average consumer — and the legal regulations surrounding it.

But asked if he thought affordable VR sex would be available in under five years, he said: “Oh, absolutely. Less than five years.”

Kelly revealed his predictions in an interview with entrepreneur and investor Tim Ferriss.

He told how he had already experienced totally life-like 3D reproductions of humans up close.

Kelly said: “I saw these guys who have volumetric capture. They use seven or more cameras to record a person in all their detail, so that when you see them in VR they’re moving around and you can see every single hair.

“The volumetric capture of a live movement is amazing — and the 3D presentation of it. I felt uncomfortable even getting close to that person. You’re in their space. They really feel like they’re there.

“And if they are giving you eye contact, and a voice, maybe your mind says they’re not really there, but your body is saying ‘They are there! That’s them!’.”

Kelly also spoke about the virtual-reality project being carried out by Linden Lab, the creators of Second Life, called Project Sansar — which is currently undergoing testing and is scheduled to be rolled out sometime in 2016.

He said: “Second Life is now doing a VR version called Sansar and it’s a thousand times better than the old Second Life because those avatars are getting their body language from [the person controlling them].

“They’re getting the voice and they have the eye contact. Even if the avatar is not exactly them, you can still see them with their voice and their body movements and their micro-expressions. They’re really there.”

Kelly started his career editing the Whole Earth Review and after co-founding Wired went on to co-found the All Species Foundation and The Rosetta Project.

He is also on the board of The Long Now Foundation and has just released his latest book, called The Inevitable: Understanding The 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future.

In his wide-ranging interview with Ferriss, he also spoke in-depth about artificial intelligence — including what it means for humanity in the immediate future.

The fee applies to basic economy fares for flights between the US and Europe or North Africa.

Basic economy passengers previously received an allowance of one free checked bag.

This week, Delta Air Lines updated its basic economy travel policy with the addition of a new checked baggage fee. If you are flying Delta basic economy between the US and Europe or North Africa, it will cost $60 to check your first bag and $100 for the second bag.

The new fee applies only to tickets purchased after December 6 for flights on or after April 10, 2018. Before the change, basic economy passengers were afforded one free checked bag on these flights, the same as Delta's main cabin passengers. Basic economy passengers traveling before April 10 will still get the free checked bag.

Delta Air Lines was not immediately available for comment.

Basic economy is a new phenomenon that has only recently become pervasive in the airline industry. The fare class is targeted at a specific band of customers for whom price is the top priority and would normally turn to low-cost carriers for air travel.

In the US, ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier have grown considerably in recent years while international LCCs like Norwegian Air and WOW Air have also made their presence felt.

Delta

By unbundling its traditional main cabin, legacy airlines like Delta are in a more competitive position to take on the growing threat of low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers in the US and abroad.

Delta's basic economy passengers do not get seat assignments in advance, are not eligible for upgrades, and cannot receive refunds.

In fact, Delta's new fees are similar to the checked bag charges customary on international low-cost carriers like Norwegian and WOW.

However, it should be noted that basic economy passengers receive the same service and amenities as all main cabin passengers once on board the flight.
