Please read the rules before joining the discussion. Describing a "very difficult" road ahead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the automaker would cut its staff by about 7 percent.The Palo Alto, California-based company grew by 30 percent last year, but struggles to remain profitable at that staffing level, Musk said in a memo to Tesla employees also posted on the company's website. The company had a "tiny profit" in the third quarter and expects to post an even smaller one in the fourth quarter, Musk said. Tesla must make the job cuts as it ramps up production of the Model 3, he said."While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people," Musk said. "We will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles."A 7 percent staff reduction would mean about 3,150 employees would be let go, based on Musk's tweet in October that Tesla has 45,000 employees."We unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7 percent ... and retain only the most critical temps and contractors," Musk said.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

But its 2018 production fell far short of a goal set nearly three years ago of manufacturing 500,000 vehicles for the year. That goal was announced in May 2016 based on advance orders for its mid-range Model 3, which Musk said sells for $44,000."Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company," Musk said. "There isn't any other way."Tesla’s shares fell earlier this month after it cut vehicle prices by $2,000 and announced fourth-quarter sales figures that fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company faces growing competition from other automakers including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Nissan.Tesla CEO Elon Musk (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)“Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we’re up against massive, entrenched competitors,” he said. "The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products."“Attempting to build affordable clean energy products at scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity,” he said in the memo, “but succeeding in our mission is essential to ensure that the future is good, so we must do everything we can to advance the cause.”Tesla will begin selling the Model 3 in Europe and China in February, a significant milestone in the company's global goals. Its factory in Shanghai is its first outside the United States.Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 13 percent to close at $302.26 on Friday. While the "knee jerk reaction" to the company's news may be negative, the long-term view for Tesla is positive, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives in a note to investors."We continue to believe Tesla will be able to emerge from the next 12 to 18 months a stronger, profitable more product diversified (geographically and price points) EV company helping lay the groundwork for Model 3 as a linchpin of growth going forward into 2020 and beyond," wrote Ives, whose firm maintains an "Outperform" rating on Tesla's stock.The staffing reductions come after a tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla. In September, the CEO agreed to step down as company chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine as part of a fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC had filed a complaint charging Musk with making a "false and misleading" statement when he tweeted in August that the company had enough funding to go private.Also in September, Musk was seen apparently smoking marijuana in a video podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. The Tesla CEO had described 2018 as "the most difficult and painful" year of his career in an interview with The New York Times.That led media mogul turned sleep advocate Arianna Huffington to issue an open letter to Musk suggesting he get more rest.He replied in his own tweet: "Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy,'' he replied.

It is not.''Contributing: The Associated PressDetroit Auto Show: Tesla under pressure as Ford, Nissan and GM roll out new competitionMore: Elon Musk says there's a '70 percent' chance he will make the trip to MarsMore: 'Let him get high': Neil deGrasse Tyson defends Elon Musk, compares Tesla CEO to Thomas EdisonFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.

Title: Tesla layoffs loom and its stock price plunges as Musk shifts focus from growth to survival - Los Angeles Times
Author: Russ Mitchell
Body: In an email to employees Friday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk painted a dim picture of the company’s near future. He said Tesla’s cars are “still too expensive for most people,” and that to cut costs, the company would have to cut 7% of its full-time workforce.Tesla’s stock plunged 13% on the news, closing Friday at $302.26 per share.In the email, Musk warned employees — and, by extension, Tesla’s investors — that profit will be down in the fourth quarter and a loss in the first quarter of 2019 is possible. “Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products,” Musk wrote.That rubs against what Musk told investors last October, when the company posted a rare quarterly profit. Tesla will be profitable and have positive cash flow going forward, he said then, and would not need to raise new capital.Musk said Friday that profit would decline in the fourth quarter, even though the company sold 7,000 more cars than in the third. Rising new-car shipments, he said, “will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort, and some luck, to target a tiny profit” in the first quarter of 2019.The blunt assessment didn’t surprise Tesla skeptics. “The company is in dire financial condition,” said Rob Majteles at Treehouse Capital. “It has been for a long time.” Majteles is one of the “short sellers” who are betting on Tesla’s stock price falling.The assessment in an email from short-seller Mark Spiegel of Stanphyl Capital was even more withering: “I certainly wouldn't want to own a company with a $55-billion market cap and $12 billion in debt if it had a CEO who can't legally deny having committed securities fraud who then put out forward guidance modifying the word ‘profit’ with the words ‘hopefully, great difficulty, luck, target, and tiny.’”Spiegel was referring to fraud charges filed last year against Musk by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk had driven up the stock price by claiming he had a deal to take Tesla private, which turned out not to be true. Musk settled the fraud charges without admitting or denying guilt.Predictably, perhaps, one Tesla booster saw the bright side.“I think it’s great,” said Ross Gerber of the Santa Monica firm Gerber Kawasaki, which owns Tesla shares and recommends the stock to its clients. “Elon needs to make Tesla a sustainable company and these are the steps toward doing that.”Tesla has about 37,000 employees. A 7% cut would mean the layoff of more than 2,500 workers.Although profits are important, it is cash flow alone that will determine Tesla’s success or failure this year. The layoff will preserve some capital, but won’t help Tesla avoid having to pay $920 million in convertible bonds due in March. At a stock price of $360 or above, those bondholders could convert the debt into shares. But after Friday’s rout, that target price will be much harder to achieve without some spectacularly good news.The amount of cash on hand at Tesla will become clearer when the company releases fourth-quarter 2018 results, probably in February. At the end of the third quarter, its cash account was near $3 billion.Cash flow depends on the success or failure of the Model 3 — 2018 can be counted as a sales success. After it emerged from crippling manufacturing problems last year, the company said it sold 145,000 Model 3s, which Musk pointed out made it “the bestselling premium vehicle of 2018 in the U.S.”When Musk announced the Model 3 nearly three years ago, he said it would cost $35,000 before government incentives, which in California would have pushed the consumer price down to $25,000. Hundreds of thousands of people placed deposits on the car. But a profitable $35,000 Model 3 is nowhere in sight. Musk admitted Friday he must get the price tag down to everyman levels to come anywhere close to selling the 400,000 Models 3s per year he once promised.With federal incentives on Tesla cars disappearing, the task becomes even harder.“The need for a lower priced variant of Model 3 becomes even greater on July 1, when the U.S. tax credit again drops in half, making our car $1,875 more expensive, and again at the end of the year when it goes away entirely,” Musk wrote.While one “mid-range” version of the Model 3 is currently available for a base price of about $45,000, adding options easily moves the price to $60,000 for most buyers.“I’m driving the Tesla Model 3 right now,” said Tesla bull Gerber from his cellphone Friday. “It’s a $60,000 car. Elon’s right, you have a limited market for $60,000.”As Tesla saturates the U.S. market for premium-priced Model 3s, Europe could help fill the gap. Musk said Model 3 sales will begin in Europe by February. A Tesla spokesman told The Times Friday that “we have received European vehicle type approval for Model 3,” meaning the car has passed safety tests and design regulations that allow it to be sold throughout the European Union. But competition is coming on fast: Audi, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz plan to start selling electric cars in Europe this year.Musk also said a new China factory would open sometime this year to manufacture Model 3s for the world’s largest automobile market. But Tesla has yet to announce whether it's got the financing needed to build the plant.Musk ended his email by trumpeting “the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the world. Full self-driving, Model Y, Semi, Truck and Roadster on the vehicle side and Powerwall/pack and Solar Roof on the energy side are only the start.”If strong Model 3 sales growth can’t be sustained, though, it’s unclear where the money for any of those projects will come from. Or the cash needed to afford a doubling of the company’s Supercharger network and a massive increase in its currently overloaded service centers.News of the Tesla layoffs comes just a week after another of Musk’s companies, Hawthorne-based SpaceX, announced it would lay off about 10% of its more than 6,000 employees. SpaceX said that it needed to become “leaner” to succeed in its plans to develop Mars spacecraft as well as a network of thousands of small satellites that would provide internet access to users on Earth.“Either of these developments, even when attempted separately, have bankrupted other organizations,” SpaceX said in the statement. “This means we must part ways with some talented and hardworking members of our team.”Times staff writer Samantha Masunaga contributed to this report.

Title: Tesla to Cut 3,000 Jobs in Bid to Sell Model 3 to Mass Market - The New York Times
Author: Anonymous
Body: AdvertisementSupported byBy Tiffany HsuTesla will reduce its full-time work force by 7 percent in an effort to lower the cost of producing its Model 3 sedan and make it a mass-market vehicle, Elon Musk, the electric-car maker’s chief executive, told employees on Friday.The least-expensive version of the Model 3 now available costs $44,000. Mr. Musk said in a companywide email that he wanted the lowest-priced Model 3 to sell for $35,000.To do so, Mr. Musk said in the email, Tesla must improve the car’s design, increase production and shed thousands of workers. “There isn’t any other way,” he wrote.Tesla shares closed down 13 percent after the announcement.The cuts, which could put more than 3,000 people out of work, follow a 9 percent reduction in Tesla’s staff in June. Another of Mr. Musk’s companies, the privately held rocket maker SpaceX, said this month that it would shrink its work force by about 10 percent.Given the continuing uncertainty in global financial markets and signs that consumers are spending less, trimming costs to focus on affordability is “a prudent thing to do” for a company that started out selling cars with an average price close to $100,000, said Romit Shah, a research analyst at Nomura Instinet.In October, Tesla reported that the third quarter of 2018 had yielded its first quarterly profit in two years, and its largest ever, thanks to cost-cutting moves, delayed payments to suppliers and a surge in production and sales.Mr. Musk said in his email on Friday that, based on preliminary, unaudited results, the company expected to earn a smaller profit in the fourth quarter.“This quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,” he wrote in his email on Friday.In the third quarter, Mr. Shah said, Tesla “needed to get to profitability to survive, and they wouldn’t have gotten there if they were selling a $35,000 car.”“They would have lost money on every car they sold,” he added, echoing a sentiment expressed by Mr. Musk last spring.To meet its production and profit targets, Tesla focused on selling more upscale models of the Model 3 to a core group of Tesla enthusiasts willing to pay the higher prices.“But there’s only a finite number of potential customers willing spend over $50,000 on a Model 3,” Mr. Shah said. “If Tesla wants to see a pathway to a million cars sold a year, they’re going to have to bring down that price point.”To succeed, the company will need to extend its appeal to a wider audience. Mr. Musk said Friday that Tesla must begin to deliver its midrange Model 3 in all markets by around May while making progress toward producing the $35,000 version he envisions.“Head count reduction is part of the process,” Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.Tesla has already lowered prices for all of its vehicles this month by $2,000 as a federal tax credit for buyers of electric cars that was worth $7,500 last year begins to be phased out.“While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,” Mr. Musk wrote. Last year “was the most challenging in Tesla’s history,” he added, and “the road ahead is very difficult.”Mr. Musk traveled to Shanghai this month to break ground for Tesla’s Gigafactory assembly plant. It is expected to be producing Model 3s by the end of the year.Having a base in China, which imposes a 15 percent tariff on imported cars, will give Tesla an advantage over automakers that produce vehicles outside the country. But economic activity is slowing in China, and many consumers there are cutting back on spending.The car market in the United States is also showing signs of strain, with sales flattening last year.Tesla is also contending with a challenge from traditional automakers like Ford, General Motors and Nissan, which are pushing harder into the electric-vehicle market. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and others have also introduced or plan to produce electric models that in many cases are less expensive than Tesla’s.As Tesla struggled last year to cope with a Model 3 production and delivery process that Mr. Musk has described as “hell,” his behavior created distractions for the company.In August, he wrote in a short, cryptic post on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private and had “funding secured,” surprising board members and driving up the stock price.The Securities and Exchange Commission later sued Mr. Musk in federal court, saying he had misled investors. He settled with the agency, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and to step aside as chairman for three years.Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.Advertisement

" He is moving faster than anybody else, going global faster than anybody else, and today, Tesla is essentially the iPhone of the electric-car market," said Westly, a California politician and venture capitalist who was an early investor in the company.While other premium automakers have now jumped into the electric-car market, they were caught "with their shorts down when the tide went out," and Tesla now has a large lead in that market, Westly said. The company also posted a surprise profit in the third quarter, and Musk has said he expects Tesla to be cash-flow positive and profitable going forward. "They've won the North American premium market race," he said. "The challenge now is to win the mass market, to go international. I think he is preparing the company to do that. I wouldn't bet against him."However, not everyone agrees with Westly's assessment.Tesla's fourth-quarter update indicated that more than 75 percent of new Model 3 orders came from new customers rather than the existing reservations list. Almost all of those new orders were for mid- and high-price variants of the sedan, said Rajvindra Gill, an analyst for Needham.Gill estimates that about 90 percent of the 420,000 reservations on that list built up the last couple of years are customers who wanted the still-unreleased standard battery version of the vehicle, which is $35,000.The issue is that as the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles continues to wind down, Tesla could start to see customers cancel reservations in the first and second quarter if the company cannot make the planned $35,000 base model quickly enough.The other issue is that Tesla's profitable quarter depended in part on selling the more expensive versions of the Model 3, which should make up a smaller piece of the total if Tesla begins producing the cheaper version. "So I think there's a lot of risk to the name given the level of valuation we see in this name, given the level of debt the company has, and given the level of competition that will be entering the market this year and next year," Gill said.Got a confidential news tip?

Title: 2 Reasons To Sell Tesla: $920M And $26,250
Author: Anonymous
Body: Illustration shows Tesla logo during the opening day of the 97th edition of the Brussels Motor Show, at Brussels Expo, on Friday 18 January 2019, in Brussels.A little more than two months from now, Tesla -- in which I have no financial interest -- could have a considerably lower cash balance.How so? The terms of a $920 million convertible bond make me think that come March 1, Tesla will have to part with at least a third of its remaining cash.Is Tesla stock overvalued? On January 18, Tesla traded at 22% below its June 2018 all-time high and it lost 13% of its value in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's decision to cut 7% of its employees.I do not think this drop makes its shares cheap. In response to my request for comment, on January 19, Tesla cited its September 30 quarterly report, which stated that Tesla has plenty of cash. As Tesla's spokesman notedOur sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, investments in tooling and manufacturing equipment for the production ramp of Model 3... 2018 capital expenditures [we estimate] to be slightly below $2.5 billion, including the acquisition of land use rights in Shanghai, China to build Gigafactory 3 [which is slated to make battery cells and Model 3 and Model Y cars] and for its initial design and construction expenses. In a January 18 letter to Tesla employees Musk justified this roughly 3,200 employee cut by citing a goal to "reach more customers who can afford" its vehicles -- a problem exacerbated by the staggered 2019 elimination of government subsidies. As he wrote:Starting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets...The need for lower priced variants of Model 3 becomes even greater on July 1, when the US tax credit again drops in half, making our car $1,875 more expensive, and again at the end of the year when it goes away entirely.Musk argued that in order to be "a viable company" Tesla must get its costs low enough to make a profit on the $35,000 (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 requiring it to cut staff.This is not the first Tesla layoff. After all in June 2018, the company ridded itself of 9% of its workers -- about 4,100 people, according to CNBC -- "during a make-or-break period as Tesla tried to increase production of the Model 3 after months of delays," according to the Wall Street Journal. This cost Tesla $34 million in "one-time restructuring charges," according to its Q3 10Q.Meanwhile, Musk said that Tesla must reengineer its manufacturing operations to boost volume and lower unit costs so it can manufacture the standard Model 3 at $35,000. As he noted, Tesla must[Increase] the Model 3 production rate and [make] many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months. Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range [Model 3 at a price of $35,000]Elon Musk has an uncomfortable relationship with the capital markets. Last year, he responded to what he saw as a war with short sellers by tweeting that funding was secured for a Tesla going-private transaction.It looks like that was not really the case and Musk settled with the SEC by relinquishing his Chairman title for three years -- while Tesla spent almost $26 million in settlement and legal expenses.This brings me to two reasons that selling Tesla shares would be wise.1. Big cash outflows looming with dwindling cash pile.Tesla has borrowed about $11 billion. $6 billion worth of that debt is recourse and most of it comes due over the next six years, according to its Q3 10Q. It needs to pay off a convertible note in the next five weeks, cover severance for its latest layoffs, and pay for the Gigafactory 3.At the end of September, Tesla had about $3 billion in cash. This brings us to Tesla's $920 million convertible preferred stock -- which comes due on March 1. If Tesla's "average share price [is at] $359.87 or higher for 20 consecutive trading days," Tesla can pay off the note with common shares, according to the Journal.But that level is 19% above its current price -- and I think it is much more likely that Tesla will need to fulfill its obligations to investors by forking over $920 million in cash.According to the prospectus, "If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may elect to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash in the case of the 2019 notes."Musk said Tesla expects to pay cash. During Tesla's second quarter earnings call, he said, "This convert that's coming due soon, $900 million or something like that. We expect to pay that off with internally generated cash flow."Tesla has another convertible note due this November -- with a principal balance of $566 million.I estimate that the latest layoffs will cost about $27 million in one-time charges -- assuming the same cost/terminated worker as Tesla incurred last June. And on January 6, Musk announced plans to build its Gigafactory 3 which will cost about $5 billion, according to Bloomberg.In October, Musk offered a much lower estimate. He said the cost for Gigafactory 3 would "probably [be] closer to $2 billion. And unless we be at a higher -- and that would be sort of the 250,000 vehicle per year rate. And so I think we could be a lot more efficient with CapEx," according to Tesla's Q2 earnings call.By my math, the cumulative effect of these cash outflows should bring Tesla's cash balance to a dangerously low level.That is unless Tesla borrows more money or sells stock. But in October, Tesla supplied two diametrically opposed answers on whether it would do that.How so? In Tesla's third quarter earnings call, Musk said, "We do not intend to raise equity or debt."But in its Q3 10Q, Tesla said it would borrow to build Gigafactory 3. "We expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory 3 will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China."Which is it, Tesla? On January 21 a person close to the company offered what strikes me as utter nonsense, noting, "There is no contradiction. If you read other stories, no one else notes there is a contradiction...Local loans aren’t raising capital and aren’t raising debt."Does this mean that if Tesla borrows $1 billion from a Chinese bank it won't be included on its balance sheet?2. Huge stretch to meet Musk's 25% gross margin on $35,000 standard ModelThis leaves me with a final question: Can Tesla make a profit selling its standard Model 3 for $35,000? I don't know what its cost of goods sold is for the Model 3.But one analyst, Vertical Group's Gordon Johnson, concluded that at a $54,000 average selling price, Tesla lost $14,000 per Model 3 in the quarter ending March 2018, according to US News and World Report. Granted those numbers were for a more costly version of the Model 3.In 2017, Musk claimed that Tesla would earn a 25% gross margin on the Model 3 in 2018, according to US News.To achieve Musk's gross margin target for the Model 3 -- and assuming Johnson is right that the Model 3 costs $68,000 to build -- Tesla would have to reduce its Model 3 cost by a whopping 61% to reach the $26,250 unit cost needed to earn a 25% gross margin on a $35,000 price.This strikes me as humanly impossible -- especially given the difficulties that Tesla has suffered already with its manufacturing process and the organizational confusion that inevitably follows a big layoff.Just because it trades 22% off its high, does not make Tesla a buy.I ditched corporate America in 1994 and started a management consulting and venture capital firm (http://petercohan.com). I began following stocks in 1981 when I was in ...

Title: Visionary Elon Musk is forced to focus on the mundane to keep his Tesla dream alive - Los Angeles Times
Author: Russ Mitchell
Body: Elon Musk set out to build a different kind of car company. He succeeded.Now he’s dealing with the consequences.As became clear over the past week and a half, the man whose mission is to help save Earth for humanity through sustainable transportation and energy — and colonize Mars as a backstop in case that doesn’t work — is being forced to focus on goals that are far more mundane, like building high-quality affordable cars and creating an efficient sales, parts and service system.“Elon has to deal with reality,” said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor and hardcore Musk fan at the Santa Monica investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.Musk emailed a note to employees Friday that plunged Tesla’s stock price 13% and wiped out $7.7 billion in market value.In the email, Musk pointed out that 2018 was the most successful year in Tesla’s history. The company delivered almost as many cars in the last quarter as it did in all prior years combined since Tesla’s founding in 2003.“Model 3 also became the best-selling premium vehicle of 2018 in the US,” he wrote. “This is truly remarkable and something that few thought possible just a short time ago.”All true. Musk has chalked up some astounding accomplishments. The Model S blew the industry away with its performance, battery range, over-the-air software updates and elegant body design. The Model 3 has drawn rave reviews for its tight, fast, fun drive.Musk understands what serious drivers love about cars and, in perhaps his most masterful achievement, made driving an electric car cool, even sexy, rather than the domain of dorks.But despite Tesla’s growth, it’s fallen far short of what Musk had been projecting, forecasts that shot the stock price so high it exceeded General Motors in market value, based on expectations of dramatic growth.Musk’s email talked less about growth and more about what’s needed to survive. He told Tesla’s 37,500 employees that 7% of them — around 2,500 — would lose their jobs. (Tesla laid off 9% of its workers last June, when Musk told employees, “We are making this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.”)Another Musk company got hit with layoffs on Jan. 11. SpaceX, the private rocket ship company, announced plans to lay off around 10% of its more than 6,000 employees.In a statement released at the time, the Hawthorne company said it needed to become “leaner” to continue delivering for its launch customers, as well as to succeed in its ambitious plans of developing Mars spacecraft and thousands of small satellites that would provide internet service to users on Earth.“Either of these developments, even when attempted separately, have bankrupted other organizations,” SpaceX said in its statement.At Tesla, Elon Musk set out to revolutionize manufacturing.He didn’t.The sophisticated robot system that Musk told analysts in 2016 would spark “a quantum change in productivity” was ripped out last year. The company is turning out less than half the cars Musk once promised — some from a tent — and those cars can be found at or near the bottom of independent quality rankings.Musk also aimed to upend traditional sales, parts and service and steer clear of franchised car dealerships by running its own retail and repair operations. The result is a high-cost customer-service nightmare, as Tesla owners spend hours trying to arrange to have their cars fixed and then have to wait weeks or months for parts.Meantime, the $35,000 mass-market Model 3, which Musk began hyping more than three years ago, remains a mirage, as luxury-price Model 3s approach the limits of customer demand.None of Tesla’s cars right now is priced for a middle-income buyer.The base Model 3 currently is $44,000. Typical customers pay around $60,000 after adding options. A high-end Model 3 goes for $70,500.The Model S sedan starts at $82,250 and runs as high as $145,000. The Model X SUV, $85,000 to $147,000. At those prices, it’s no surprise high-margin S and X sales have reached a limit of about 100,000 cars a year.Federal incentives on Tesla cars got chopped in half in January to $3,750, will be cut in half again in July and disappear at year’s end.So Tesla must contend, belatedly, with an inevitable shift from the days when it could focus on a narrow, obsessed band of high-income luxury buyers excited about over-the-air software updates to one where it has to worry about squeezing nickels out of the cost of a mass-market product for a middle-class clientele, while providing timely repairs of fenders and windshields to 400,000 car owners.In other words, Tesla must act more like traditional car companies that have continuously improved basic logistics and manufacturing processes over the past 100 years.The upcoming layoffs will reduce costs to help Tesla produce a profitable $35,000 Model 3, Musk said in his Friday email.“We need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles,” Musk wrote. “We need to continue making progress towards lower priced variants of Model 3.”Engineering improvement on the manufacturing line also will be needed to boost throughput and cut thousands of dollars off the cost of each Model 3 to make the cars more affordable, Musk said.To make these and other fixes, Tesla had nearly $3 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter. Fourth-quarter results, including cash on hand, will be released probably next month.Analyst Jessica Caldwell at auto-pricing site Edmunds.com told clients Friday: “It’s refreshing to see Elon Musk announcing practical, traditional steps to get Tesla ready for what could be the company’s most challenging year yet.”“When you’re talking about a company that builds tents to solve production challenges, it’s almost more notable when you see them doing something conventional,” she said.You’d think other projects would be sidelined while Tesla fixes current problems, but Musk nonetheless pumped his dreams for the future at the end of his employee email: “Full self-driving, Model Y, Semi, Truck and Roadster on the vehicle side and Powerwall/pack and Solar Roof on the energy side are only the start,” he said.But employees are being laid off at the Buffalo, N.Y., site where the tiles for the solar roof are being made. (Musk unveiled the solar roof tile project at Universal Studios in 2016 weeks before Tesla bought SolarCity, whose board Musk chaired and in which he was a big investor. The tiles Musk showed off, Fast Company revealed, were non-functional.) Employees are being laid off at Tesla sales and service centers as well, putting more pressure on an already overburdened system.Some longtime supporters are growing frustrated with the company. Kim, the hyper-chipper star of the “Like Tesla” YouTube channel, posted a critical video last week. “I am one of Tesla’s biggest superfans, but I also feel like I can’t let my love for them cloud my judgment,” she said. “Tesla customer service kind of sucks right now.” She beseeched the company to spend more on service operations to deal with its “growing pains.”Gali, another superfan, said on his “Hyper Change” YouTube channel that “Tesla’s culture is chickens running around with their heads cut off. It’s a company that’s growing like crazy, they try to do so many things at once.”Investor Gerber says he believes, too, that Tesla’s problems reflect growing pains.“Tesla’s not going anywhere. They’re not going bankrupt,” he said. Musk’s email is a “good sign” he’s ready to do what’s needed to maintain Tesla growth, Gerber said. “It’s a sign that he’s in a better place mentally.”Times staff writer Samantha Masunaga contributed to this report.

Title: 30 Shocking Tesla Sales Charts | CleanTechnica
Author: Anonymous
Body: Published on January 20th, 2019 | by Zachary ShahanJanuary 20th, 2019 by Zachary Shahan With our US large luxury car sales report, US small & midsize luxury car sales report, US electric vehicle sales report, and other Tesla-related sales reports recently completed, it’s time for another edition of Nasty Tesla Charts!The number of charts keeps growing. All in all, the sales charts show Tesla’s dramatic rise in the US and globally in 2018, its dominance of a few segments of the market, and why it’s finally being treated quite seriously by executives of other major auto firms.Given the high number of charts and the fact that we’ve written about all of them before, the rest of this article doesn’t include much text — just short notes highlighting the takeaway points of each chart. Enjoy.(Note that on several charts, there’s an option to click between different vehicles or timeframes.)if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["iCWyX"]={},window.datawrapper["iCWyX"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-iCWyX"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("iCWyX"==b)window.datawrapper["iCWyX"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});This first chart shows Tesla’s dramatic rise over the past ~6 years. The company rose from 2,400 exciting, exhilarating, groundbreaking deliveries in Q4 2012 to a mere 90,700 in Q4 2016.Okay, that’s not too shabby. I’m sure you could have done better, but hey, cut Elon some slack.Somehow, the record 90,700 deliveries disappointed already bearish analysts on Wall Street, but that’s another story that we’re not digging into here.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["k34Di"]={},window.datawrapper["k34Di"].embedDeltas={"100":502.011364,"200":451.011364,"300":426.011364,"400":426.011364,"500":400.011364,"700":400.011364,"800":400.011364,"900":400.011364,"1000":400.011364},window.datawrapper["k34Di"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-k34Di"),window.datawrapper["k34Di"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["k34Di"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["k34Di"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("k34Di"==b)window.datawrapper["k34Di"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Splitting out that sales growth by model over the past couple of years, it’s clear who the big dog is. It’s the littlest dog. The Model 3 unveiling shocked the world on March 31, 2016, both because it received over 100,000 reservation before it was even shown to the public and because those reservations poured in faster after the reveal. Many onlookers remained skeptical. Would those reservations really convert to sales? Well, apparently, many of them did and Tesla also started pulling in higher numbers of non-reservation sales. Score for Tesla.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["QmWYy"]={},window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].embedDeltas={"100":700.011364,"200":583.011364,"300":542.011364,"400":526.011364,"500":500.011364,"700":483.011364,"800":483.011364,"900":483.011364,"1000":483.011364},window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-QmWYy"),window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("QmWYy"==b)window.datawrapper["QmWYy"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});This interactive chart uses the same data as the line graph above. This time, however, you can more blatantly drool over pointedly examine Tesla Model 3 sales growth.By the way, I’ll take an opportunity here to note: If you would like to cut pollution and go electric by buying a Tesla, feel free to use my referral code — http://ts.la/tomasz7234 — to get 6 months of free Supercharging (or 9 months if you don’t bother to test drive the car). If you would like to cut pollution by getting a Tesla Energy rooftop solar or solar + Powerwall system, you can also use our referral code to get an extended 5-year warranty. The deadline to use a referral code for the above benefits is February 1, 2019.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["0iyiO"]={},window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].embedDeltas={"100":477.011364,"200":426.011364,"300":400.011364,"400":400.011364,"500":400.011364,"700":400.011364,"800":400.011364,"900":400.011364,"1000":400.011364},window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-0iyiO"),window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("0iyiO"==b)window.datawrapper["0iyiO"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Exiting Tesla world and looking at how the Tesla Model 3 compares to the top selling cars in the United States is different kind of fun. The shocking thing here is that the Model 3 is in the vicinity of these Toyotas and Hondas despite its much higher average selling price.Although, the thing is: the Model 3’s low operational costs mean its total cost of ownership is closer to those non-luxury models than you’d think at first glance. Also, the Model 3 is much safer, much quicker, and much more high tech. And it’s 100% electric, which means it’s clean. The extra value from those benefits exceeds any extra upfront cost for hundreds of thousands of people.This is another interactive chart. You can click from December to Q4 to 2018 to get deeper perspective on how Model 3 sales compared to these Honda & Toyota sales. Model 3 production was ramping up throughout the year, so we’ll have to work our way through 2019 before we see how the Model 3 compares in a “normal” production year and without a backlog of reservations. (I’m bullish, but this article is about looking backwards, not forecasting.)if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["pV7TX"]={},window.datawrapper["pV7TX"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-pV7TX"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("pV7TX"==b)window.datawrapper["pV7TX"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Looking at the sales changes from year to year (2017 to 2018) for these top 5 models, it’s hard to not get the impression that Model 3 sales are eating into Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, Honda Accord, and Honda Civic sales. Indeed, despite the trend toward crossovers and SUVs, we do know that many Model 3 buyers come from the Accord, Civic, Toyota Prius, BMW 3 Series, and Nissan LEAF.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["AWBGY"]={},window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].embedDeltas={"100":684.011364,"200":617.011364,"300":600.011364,"400":600.011364,"500":600.011364,"700":600.011364,"800":600.011364,"900":600.011364,"1000":600.011364},window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-AWBGY"),window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("AWBGY"==b)window.datawrapper["AWBGY"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Here’s just one more fun way to compare these 5 vehicles’ 2018 sales versus 2017 sales. Again, click through each model to see all the charts. Note: the last one is the most fun.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["X9f5F"]={},window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].embedDeltas={"100":941.011364,"200":865.011364,"300":865.011364,"400":839.011364,"500":839.011364,"700":839.011364,"800":839.011364,"900":839.011364,"1000":839.011364},window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-X9f5F"),window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("X9f5F"==b)window.datawrapper["X9f5F"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});In this chart, I start breaking down the full list of America’s 20 most popular cars. (To be clear, this doesn’t include SUVs, crossovers, and pickup trucks, which are in other vehicle classes.)In this chart, we’re just looking at December 2018. The Model 3 number is a CleanTechnica estimate, but it’s based on official Tesla numbers for the quarter and common assumptions about Tesla’s delivery patterns.Yet again, the staggering thing is that there isn’t another luxury car anywhere close to the Model 3. The only other luxury car on this list is the Mercedes CLA-Class, which is way down at #18.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["prQDt"]={},window.datawrapper["prQDt"].embedDeltas={"100":941.011364,"200":865.011364,"300":865.011364,"400":839.011364,"500":839.011364,"700":839.011364,"800":839.011364,"900":839.011364,"1000":839.011364},window.datawrapper["prQDt"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-prQDt"),window.datawrapper["prQDt"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["prQDt"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["prQDt"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("prQDt"==b)window.datawrapper["prQDt"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});The Model 3 ranks similarly for the full quarter, just a tad behind the #4 Toyota Corolla to sit comfortably in the #5 spot.Naturally, no matter how excited Tesla buyers and fans are about this nearly impossible ranking for such a young company in such a niche segment, Tesla critics remain steadfast in their claims that it isn’t enough and the whole success story will implode any day. The thing I find useful to remember is that some of these people have been making this claims for approximately a decade, every notable milestone along the way.Cognitive dissonance is a bitch.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["AdYjV"]={},window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].embedDeltas={"100":941.011364,"200":865.011364,"300":865.011364,"400":839.011364,"500":839.011364,"700":839.011364,"800":839.011364,"900":839.011364,"1000":839.011364},window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-AdYjV"),window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("AdYjV"==b)window.datawrapper["AdYjV"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Largely due to the Model 3’s relative low production at the beginning of 2018, when you look at full year sales, Tesla’s 4th production vehicle landed in the #11 spot.Admittedly, it was a bit disappointing to not see the Model 3 break into the top 10, but #11 is still a mind-boggling 2018 ranking, the more so when you consider all that Tesla and its tens of thousands of employees went through over the past 7 years.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["heaLn"]={},window.datawrapper["heaLn"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-heaLn"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("heaLn"==b)window.datawrapper["heaLn"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Okay, this is where the charts really start to get a bit nasty. No offense to Porsche and Jaguar here, both of which seem to now be aiming for electric leadership themselves, but I find that this chart really helps to put Tesla into some useful perspective in the broader global auto market.Tesla was ~14,000 units short of matching Porsche’s global sales and Jaguar’s global sales combined in the 4th quarter.If you click through to the 2018 tab, Tesla was ~11,000 sales short of reaching Porsche. One more quarter and Tesla will surely have a higher running 12 month total. Meanwhile, Tesla is already ~75,000 sales above Jaguar.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["7DE4u"]={},window.datawrapper["7DE4u"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-7DE4u"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("7DE4u"==b)window.datawrapper["7DE4u"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});I didn’t initially intend to include this chart or the next two, but then I was inspired to write a piece comparing the sales of some previously labeled “Tesla killers” to Tesla vehicles.The Chevy Bolt, a solid car that we have praised many times, simply doesn’t compete with the Model 3 in a handful of ways that matter to many consumers — safety, acceleration, superfast charging access, autonomous driving tech, and the cleantech chops of the parent company, for example. The result, combined with factors related to auto dealerships and regulations, is the chart you see above.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["HsG7q"]={},window.datawrapper["HsG7q"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-HsG7q"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("HsG7q"==b)window.datawrapper["HsG7q"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Long before the Chevy Bolt was portrayed in the media as a Tesla killer, there was the BMW i3. I drive an i3. I love the i3. But the i3 is no Tesla and that’s why it doesn’t sell like one. Tesla’s Model S and Model 3 offer several advantages — just like they do compared to the Bolt — that make most people heavily favor buying one of them over an i3. Actually, the i3 just has one core selling point over a Tesla, as far as I can tell — it’s tiny.With superfast charging, more range, something comparable to Tesla Autopilot, quicker acceleration, some restyling, and a higher safety rating, perhaps the i3 (or a bigger i4 or i5) could see 10× more sales. What do you think?if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["oL8zz"]={},window.datawrapper["oL8zz"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-oL8zz"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("oL8zz"==b)window.datawrapper["oL8zz"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});BMW has several plug-in hybrids to complement the i3 in its “electrified vehicle” lineup. Many have argued that plug-in hybrids are more practical and consumer friendly at this stage of the rEVolution, so I figured it could be more interesting to compare Tesla sales to BMW & MINI electrified vehicle sales. It turns out Tesla still had a 100,000+ lead in 2018 globally.Perhaps BMW should really try to deliver an i4 or i5 with comparable specs, features, and pricing to a Tesla Model 3. Of course, it needed to start on that ~5 years ago, but one can hope.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["n35CV"]={},window.datawrapper["n35CV"].embedDeltas={"100":1334.011364,"200":1258.011364,"300":1207.011364,"400":1207.011364,"500":1207.011364,"700":1181.011364,"800":1181.011364,"900":1181.011364,"1000":1181.011364},window.datawrapper["n35CV"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-n35CV"),window.datawrapper["n35CV"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["n35CV"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["n35CV"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("n35CV"==b)window.datawrapper["n35CV"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});This is perhaps the nastiest Tesla chart of all. Clearly, the Model 3 is “the one that doesn’t belong” here. It looks like something is wrong with this one, and I even had to question my work for a moment. The Model 3 is showing that it’s not just competitive in the midsize luxury car class — it’s in a class of its own.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["6vcxz"]={},window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].embedDeltas={"100":1309.011364,"200":1232.011364,"300":1207.011364,"400":1207.011364,"500":1181.011364,"700":1181.011364,"800":1181.011364,"900":1181.011364,"1000":1181.011364},window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-6vcxz"),window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("6vcxz"==b)window.datawrapper["6vcxz"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Looking at full year sales doesn’t help much to even out the playing field. The Model 3 is still more than twice as competitive as the next best luxury car, if you base competitiveness on sales.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["eLocn"]={},window.datawrapper["eLocn"].embedDeltas={"100":650.011364,"200":574.011364,"300":523.011364,"400":523.011364,"500":523.011364,"700":497.011364,"800":497.011364,"900":497.011364,"1000":497.011364},window.datawrapper["eLocn"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-eLocn"),window.datawrapper["eLocn"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["eLocn"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["eLocn"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("eLocn"==b)window.datawrapper["eLocn"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Months ago, it hit me that it would be more fair to compare the Model 3 to model combinations from the other automakers. Tesla doesn’t have multiple midsize luxury cars to choose from, and doesn’t have any small luxury cars to choose from. So, it seems more sensible to combined the other luxury automakers midsize cars (and I think even their small cars) when comparing sales data.Nonetheless, Tesla still dominates the market, with nearly twice as many sales in December as Mercedes-Benz’s fleet in these categories and taking a whopping 32% of the market.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"]={},window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].embedDeltas={"100":511.011364,"200":434.011364,"300":409.011364,"400":409.011364,"500":383.011364,"700":383.011364,"800":383.011364,"900":383.011364,"1000":383.011364},window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-uzTZ4"),window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("uzTZ4"==b)window.datawrapper["uzTZ4"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Looking at the full year is where you finally get a chart that makes the market look competitive.

It was once the hype of the auto market, the talk of the town, the cutting-edge, award-gobbling car shocking the world. With the Model 3 here and dominating sales, the Model S hardly gets a mention. Nonetheless, it continues to dominate the large luxury car class in the same way that the Model 3 dominates the midsize luxury car class (+ small luxury car class). It’s still hard to believe, especially when you consider how low overall public awareness of Tesla and its products is.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["fYyc3"]={},window.datawrapper["fYyc3"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-fYyc3"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("fYyc3"==b)window.datawrapper["fYyc3"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});This month is the first time I created the above multi-quarter interactive chart for the Model S and its gasmobile competitors.

It was #3 in the 4th quarter and #2 across the year, according to our estimates. Still an admirable showing, and I’m sure automakers below it would love that spot, but it seems the Model X needs a little bit of a booster to knock the Cadillac Escalade off of its ginormous, flashy throne.if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["nhIXU"]={},window.datawrapper["nhIXU"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-nhIXU"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("nhIXU"==b)window.datawrapper["nhIXU"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["ANjM0"]={},window.datawrapper["ANjM0"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-ANjM0"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("ANjM0"==b)window.datawrapper["ANjM0"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});Combining all luxury car sales (not SUVs and crossovers), Tesla didn’t come close to breaking a sweat on its way to #1 in December.

Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, and BMW still have popular crossovers and SUVs that log tens of thousands of sales a month.

Naturally, the stock market is volatile. Who knows where TSLA will be on Monday, next Friday, or a year from now.We don’t provide investment advice, but it’s fun to track Tesla’s position on the market, where its market cap is connected to its auto sales in a very different way than other automakers.Hopefully you enjoyed this January edition of Nasty Tesla Charts.

Title: Tesla gets green light for Model 3 deliveries to Europe - MarketWatch
Author: Mike Murphy
Body: A regulator has given Tesla Inc. the green light to deliver its Model 3 cars to Europe, opening up an important new market following recent layoffs to cut costs.On Monday, the Netherlands Vehicles Authority, which has regulatory authority on behalf of the EU, said the Model 3 met requirements for European roads. Tesla had expected the approval, and opened online orders for some European countries earlier this month.A Tesla spokesperson said deliveries of the Model 3 long-range variant are expected to start in February. The blog Electrek reported a cargo ship carrying more than 1,000 Model 3’s left San Francisco, possibly bound for Europe, a little over a week ago.On Monday, Tesla tweeted a photo of “European Model 3s off the production line.”European Model 3s off the production line.

Title: More Bad News: Tesla Is About to Owe $920 Million in Debt
Author: Anonymous
Body: Elon Musk-led electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla has had a chaotic month. End-of-the-year figures showed that it had scaled up production dramatically in 2018, but weeks later the company announced that it was laying off seven percent of its workforce.Now, CNBC speculates that some of those financial jitters could stem from a nearly billion-dollar debt that’s about to come due to for the automaker — a tough start to 2019 that could impact not just Tesla’s long-term chances but the outlook of the entire EV industry.The debt stems from a financial instrument called a “convertible senior note,” according to CNBC: basically, if the company’s stock is trading for more than $359.87 on March 1, the debt will convert into Tesla shares — but if not, it’ll owe the $920 million debt in cash.Why’s that bad news for Tesla? Because the automaker’s stock hasn’t traded above that value in weeks, the network reports.Tesla has clearly been making efforts to shore up its bottom line. In addition to he layoffs, it dropped its longstanding customer referral program this past week.If it’s forced to cough up the debt, according to CNBC, Tesla will wipe out approximately a third of its cash reserves — a bleak state of affairs for a futuristic venture that’s struggled with certain business norms as it attempts to upend an established industry.READ MORE: Tesla Cuts 7% of Its Workforce, and Elon Musk Sees a ‘Very Difficult’ Road Ahead [CNBC]More on Tesla: Elon Musk: Tesla Is Dropping Its Customer Referral Program

Title:     Tesla influencing the rest of the auto industry is completely wrong - Business Insider

Author: Matthew DeBord
Body: If you follow Tesla and the company's endless flurry of news, non-news, rumor, innuendo, and Twitterific chatter, you might think that the entire auto industry is furiously chasing a relatively tiny upstart California company that will do well to have sold 250,000 vehicles last year. Such is Tesla's reality-distortion field. You can't really blame it on CEO Elon Musk; Tesla's fans are, as a group, given to dramatic overstatement. Read more: Cadillac revealed a futuristic electric SUV concept that will rival Tesla's Model X — and it looks awesome I just got back from the Detroit Auto Show, and in my conversations with various auto executives, the word "Tesla" came up not once. Tesla wasn't at the event, but that's because Tesla doesn't really do car shows. Why bother? It's selling only three vehicles. Nearly 50% of what it could put on display — a new Roadster sports car, a Semi truck, and a pickup — are still in the preproduction or concept stages. Cadillac's new electric-vehicle platform. Cadillac Overall, the auto industry is doing fine without worrying about what Tesla is up to, and it has plenty of bigger problems to contend with. Sales in the US again came in at near-record levels in 2018, and the most popular vehicles among consumers — SUVs and pickup trucks — are also the most profitable. But General Motors is continuing to manage its business aggressively, idling underperforming factories and expanding its investment in autonomous and electric mobility. Ford is engaged in a deep restructuring. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is dealing with an unexpected leadership transition after the sudden death last year of CEO Sergio Marchionne. And Nissan's former chairman, the onetime industry legend Carlos Ghosn, continues to reside in a Tokyo jail on charges of financial impropriety. Outsize belief in Tesla's influence isn't yet a serious affliction. But it's getting worse, and at some point it will be serious. The truth is that there isn't much that Tesla is doing that the traditional industry needs or wants to copy. So far, the biggest shift possibly inspired by Tesla was GM's and Ford's decision to report quarterly rather than monthly US sales data — essentially an accounting tweak. GM unveiled the Chevy Bolt and got it to market in 2016 in about a year. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Electric vehicles aren't that complicated from an engineering standpoint. GM proved rather decisively that it could design, build, and launch a long-range mass-market EV, the Chevy Bolt, in about a year. The car has been on sale since late 2016. EVs are a battery and motor, maybe two. Tesla's software and infotainment systems capture a lot of attention, but those aren't core elements of an automobile. Tesla obviously learned this in 2018, as it struggled mightily with the basics of modern mass production, something other automakers perfected in the 1980s. Detroit has been doing a good job of pitching an electrified future. Two of the biggest news stories to come out of the Detroit Auto Show were GM's decision to make Cadillac its lead electric brand and Ford's announcement that it's developing an all-electric version of its top-selling F-150 pickup truck. What Tesla boosters seem to miss is that electrification is trivially easy for big car companies. It's hard for Tesla because the company is just 15 years old and has been building its own vehicles in serious volumes for only about three years. The learning curve is quite steep in the type of complicated supply-chain-and-capital-intensive manufacturing that gives consumers many millions of new and widely varied vehicles each year to choose from. Tesla's strength, like Apple's, is the refinement of existing ideas. Over a decade ago, Tesla developed a better battery. The company has pioneered over-the-air software updates for its cars, set a standard for luxury EV design and performance, and proved that substantial EV sales are aided by developing a widespread network of fast-charging stations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Patrick Fallon / Reuters Of these, the one that the traditional industry has latched onto is the charging piece. But otherwise, Tesla isn't causing anyone in the world's automaking capitals to lose sleep. They have President Donald Trump for that, not to mention numerous factors beyond their control, such as gas prices, credit conditions, exchange rates, and unpredictable geopolitics. If Tesla did eventually cause auto executives to toss and turn, then those execs would simply ... make some more electric cars. This is, after all, what they do and have been doing for over a century: making cars. They aren't even all that enthusiastic about competing with Tesla, despite what various short-sellers might believe. Competition costs money. Sure, Ford and Chevy compete for pickup-truck buyers. But they also each sell a staggering number of moneymaking pickups each year, and they can expect to keep doing that, year after year. They have a pretty good sense of what that game is all about. Meanwhile, overdoing it on what could be too many low-profit, low-sales EVs would be throwing money away. On the environmental side, it would be far better for the planet if the traditional industry sold hybrid gas-electric versions of all the vehicles it manufactures. But unfortunately, if Tesla has had one striking influence, it's been to undermine the once robust hybrid market and push those customers toward far more expensive all-electric vehicles. Make no mistake: Tesla is a great company. It makes great cars. It has done something nobody in the industry thought was possible by creating a vibrant all-electric brand. But is it exerting a radical influence on the car business? Hardly. Get the latest Tesla stock price here. This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

"Reducing headcount also suggests productivity gains," Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said in a note to investors. "This is, in our view, consistent with slower growth rates but mostly the scope to improve productivity and flow that we identified during our visit to the Fremont plant mid November 2018."Hours before the note, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is cutting its full-time staff headcount by about 7 percent. The cut represents about 3,150 layoffs, based on the most recent Tesla staff count of 45,000 from Musk in October. Jefferies estimated the job cuts would affect 3,200 to 3,500 people at the electric vehicle maker. Houchois said the "reduction was not unexpected." "It's not a huge surprise to see this," Oppenheimer senior research analyst Colin Rusch said on CNBC's "Squawk Box. " "This looks to us like a mix of a proactive move in terms of cutting costs, ... but also a bit of cleanup on the kind of massive push to get the Model 3 out this year," Rusch added.Four other analysts – Baird's Ben Kallo, Wedbush's Dan Ives, Canaccord Genuity's Jed Dorsheimer and Consumer Edge's Derek Glynn – also saw the cuts as largely positive. "You never want to see a growth company cutting staff like this but we're not overly concerned," Rusch said.Citigroup's Itay Michaeli was one of the few analysts skeptical of Tesla's future following the announcement. Michaeli said in a note that the company's lowered fourth quarter guidance and job cut announcement supports the "argument that Tesla's [third quarter] results weren't sustainable."Tesla's stock fell 13 percent Friday, closing at $302.26 a share.Here are the price targets for the analysts mentioned: Jefferies, $450 a share; Oppenheimer, $418 a share; Consumer Edge, $350 a share; Canaccord Genuity, $323 a share; Wedbush, $440 a share; Baird, $465 a share; Citigroup, $284 a share.The growing electric vehicle market was also front of mind for analysts. The competitive landscape, or lack thereof, gives Tesla another advantage even as it expects to report a thin profit in its upcoming quarterly results. Morgan Stanley estimates Tesla made up 90 percent of the value of the EV market in 2018, with 80 percent of the sales. "Where's the competition?" Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said in a note to investors published shortly before the job cut announcement.Jefferies and Oppenheimer similarly pointed out how large a gap there is in EV sales between Tesla and the rest of the auto industry. "We continue to be underwhelmed by competitive offerings which we believe extend Tesla's window of opportunity, but note that scaling to 500,000 annual Model 3 production will be challenging and require a capacity expansion," Rusch said. "We believe Tesla continues to lead the industry as it moves Model 3 price point towards $35k while most competitors remain engaged in an EV negative margin sum game at higher price points," Houchois said.– CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.WATCH:Got a confidential news tip?

Title: As Tesla Faces Latest Cash Crisis, Musk Might Want To Consider A Franchise Dealership Model
Author: Anonymous

Musk has unveiled his underground transportation tunnel, allowing reporters and VIPs to take some of the first rides in the subterranean tube, which the tech entrepreneur says is the answer to what he calls "soul-destroying traffic." (Robyn Beck/Pool Photo via AP)Last week, Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, notified employees that the company needed to improve its profitability to become a “viable company.” This meant a 7% reduction in hourly and salaried staff, the elimination of its sales referral program, and an increase in its Supercharging pricing. But despite changes, Tesla has a record of costly and capital-intensive decisions, in part because the company prides itself on doing things differently. For example, Tesla opted to build commoditized components, such as seats, in-house, rather than relying on global seat suppliers that can produce more efficiently. Tesla also assumed that automation would reduce labor costs and speed up production, but as the legacy auto industry already knew, robots cannot yet replace human hands for every function. And while this last item might surprise some, one major area where Tesla has received very little return on its investment is its direct sale model.It’s no secret that Tesla does not want franchise dealers. The company’s stance is based upon the notion that franchised dealers cannot properly sell electric vehicles (EVs). So, Tesla spent billions of dollars on its own retail locations, service centers, call centers, and the personnel to populate them. As a result, despite its high gross margin, Tesla has the highest selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses of any of its established competitors (on a per unit basis), expenses that have not meaningfully reversed even as Tesla’s sales volume increases.Tesla operates a U.S. network of 125+ retail locations, 75+ service centers, as well as multiple call centers. To build this network, Tesla procured the land or space for these properties, then designed, constructed, and equipped these locations. It then hired, trained, and staffed local salespeople to sell and deliver vehicles and hired skilled technicians and service-related staff. But with a franchise model, all of these tasks (and the associated financial debt and liability) would be left to Tesla’s dealers, who would have to build and staff Tesla retail stores, call centers, and service centers in accordance with its brand standards. This reality holds true with any automaker today that requires its franchise dealers to provide facilities and staff in accordance with its unique standards, including prohibiting the sale of other makes. New vehicle inventory management is another area where automotive incumbents have a lead over Tesla. Traditional automakers are instantly paid by dealers as soon as a vehicle leaves the factory floor. Thus, automakers are not liable for the cash (or balance sheet debt) for vehicle inventory, including vehicles that are used for test drives at the dealership. Tesla could eliminate the expenses and balance sheet debt associated with new cars, even with its build-to-order model (which was intended to reduce inventory). As Tesla continues to increase sales, especially with its goal of 500,000 units or more, new car inventory carrying costs will prove even more burdensome.Revamping used vehicle inventory management also poses a significant benefit to Tesla. The automaker is currently responsible for the residual risk of vehicles at lease maturity as well as reselling them after lease-end. These tasks include inspecting and readying these units for retail sale, while also paying the interest expense to inventory them. So, for example, if a lease for a Tesla Model S is based on the vehicle being worth $60,000 at lease-end, and it’s only worth $50,000 when retailed, then Tesla is responsible for the $10,000 difference plus all the costs it incurred to sell the vehicle. These are responsibilities generally reserved for franchise dealers, so it’s no surprise that Tesla is struggling with used vehicle remarketing to the point that it cannot fulfill the bare necessities, such as fixing cosmetic repairs or even providing photos of its inventory.According to U.S. Tesla inventory consolidator, EV-CPO.com, Tesla currently has over 1,500 used vehicles for sale in the U.S., some of which are more than two years old and have had price reductions in excess of $50,000. If Tesla had dealers, they, not the automaker, would carry the expense burden and price risk associated with selling used vehicles by the creation of a certified pre-owned program that is similar to those currently offered by several automakers. For example, most new vehicles that are leased from BMW Financial Services (BMW’s captive lender) will be immediately sold to a BMW dealer at lease maturity. BMW dealers are required to purchase a high percentage of off-lease units at either the lease contract’s residual price or the current wholesale market price even if they do not wish to retail them. By increasing the number of independent sellers in the market that are obliged to buy off-lease inventory, BMW has greater control over residual values, which lowers its depreciation costs and associated liability. To handle the flow of incoming vehicles, BMW dealers have been forced to develop efficient remarketing processes that generally sell these units within 30-to-45 days after lease-end, while lowering the overall per unit selling expenses and also turning inventory more quickly. Incidentally, via customer satisfaction scores, BMW penalizes dealers that do not perform cosmetic repairs or provide accurate photos of their vehicles.Many skeptics have argued against an indirect franchise model, stating that Tesla would need to increase prices in order to support it. But the average gross profit per new vehicle retailed by franchise dealers in the U.S. is only $2,231, a slim margin for Tesla to consider given that most of its model variants sell for over $70,000. Moreover, Tesla’s low maintenance requirement but highly technical vehicles are an ideal profit center for a dealership. Tesla service shops, operated by franchise dealers, could benefit from a high throughput for vehicles needing maintenance, and for technical repairs, they are less likely to lose repairs to independent shops as Tesla vehicles are highly specialized. And since dealers make a profit on service, they would be incentivized to build the capacity to meet their local customers’ needs. This is especially relevant to the automaker’s growth strategy as many Tesla owners have complained in online forums that current customer pay maintenance and repair costs are excessive, never mind long wait times.While Tesla currently has a high gross margin, it gives it away with the highest SG&A among the major automakers. As the automaker grapples with its latest cash issues, it might consider that several Chinese automakers (many of which are producing EVs at lower price points than Tesla) have concluded that the franchise dealer model is the most effective method to sell their vehicles in the U.S. market. As Tesla continues to scale its model and is forced to act and compete more like a traditional automaker, it will need to consider options that allow it to invest in building better vehicles at lower prices, rather than investing in low margin and capital-intensive ancillary services. This reality is becoming increasingly pressing to the automaker as it now faces intense EV competition from both the Chinese and incumbent automakers while also losing the benefit of tax credits.I provide strategy-level consulting services to companies within the automotive industry.

Title: 
                Exclusive: Tesla holds battery supply talks with China's Lishen - Reuters
Author: Anonymous
Body: 5 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has held talks with China’s Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai factory, and two people with direct knowledge of the matter said the pair signed a preliminary agreement. The companies have yet to decide how large an order Tesla would place, and Lishen is still working out what battery cell size Tesla would require, one of the people said. Details of the agreement were unclear. In Chinese, a preliminary agreement could refer to mere acknowledgment through to a statement of intent. The talks come as Tesla looks to localize battery cell production in the face of mounting competition from a swathe of domestic EV makers in the world’s largest car market, where a Sino-U.S. trade war is increasing the cost of U.S. imports. Tesla said it received quotes from Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for the Shanghai plant but did not proceed further. “We have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,” a Tesla spokeswoman told Reuters. Lishen told Reuters that it had not signed any agreement with Tesla to supply batteries to the factory. The first source reiterated that a preliminary agreement was signed. The second source said Tesla’s supplier certification process usually took a long time to be finalised. The people declined to be identified because the discussions were private. Japan’s Panasonic Corp (6752.T) is currently Tesla’s exclusive battery cell supplier. Its shares closed down 2.7 percent after the Reuters report. It also announced a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) on Tuesday to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at the Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources. “Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner,” Musk said in a tweet in November. Panasonic said in a statement it was studying various possibilities with regards to Tesla’s Shanghai plant, but nothing had been decided. It declined to comment on the possibility of losing exclusive-supplier status with Tesla. Other battery makers in the running for contracts could include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (300750.SZ) and LG Chem Ltd (051910.KS). Tesla broke ground on the $2 billion so-called Gigafactory, its first in China, earlier this month and plans to begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) there by the end of the year. Musk has said the factory will produce “more affordable” vehicles for the Chinese auto market. Lishen, which says its clients range from Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) to Geely (0175.HK) and Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), has joined other battery makers in aggressively pursuing contracts with the rapidly growing EV industry. The Chinese company started mass production of the same type of cylindrical battery made by Panasonic for Tesla’s Model 3 in 2017, in the city of Suzhou about 100 km (60 miles) away from Shanghai. Panasonic and Toyota on Tuesday announced a joint venture that leverages the heft of one of the world’s largest automakers and one of the world’s biggest battery makers to expand their EV push. The joint venture builds on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement. It would also help Panasonic cut its heavy reliance on Tesla, whose production delays have weighed on the Japanese company’s earnings. Panasonic planned to shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla would remain under the company, a source said.

And they could be equipped with batteries from domestic manufacturers, ending Japanese electronics maker Panasonic’s position as the sole battery cell supplier to Tesla.In November, Elon Musk, CEO of the California-based carmaker said in a tweet that Tesla would consider several battery cell suppliers for its first overseas factory. A Reuters report Tuesday suggests Tesla is moving along with those plans.Reuters reported that Tesla had signed a “preliminary agreement” with state-owned Lishen Battery, citing unnamed sources, but later said it was unclear what the firms had agreed. Tesla said in an email statement to Quartz that the firm had received quotes from Lishen Battery, but hadn’t signed any agreement with it. Tesla declined to comment on whether it was having talks with other local battery makers.The news comes just days after Tesla began building a factory in Shanghai with an aggressive goal—it wants to start assembling Model 3 sedans as soon as later the year. The factory will eventually have an annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles, and will focus on manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y cars. The firm had said earlier that it wanted to make Model 3 affordable for China, its largest overseas market. Musk said on Twitter in November that “local production for local markets… is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.”Tianjin-based Lishen Battery makes phone batteries for clients like Apple and Huawei, and also in recent years began supplying batteries to leading Chinese electric vehicle makers like BAIC and Geely. It couldn’t be reached for comment.Panasonic is a joint-venture partner in Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. Together, the two firms produce around 60% of the global electric vehicle battery output, according to a Musk tweet in November. Panasonic said in a statement it was in talks with Tesla regarding various possibilities for its China factory but nothing was finalized. It declined to comment on the possibility of no longer having an exclusive partnership with Tesla.Panasonic’s annual capacity in China is reportedly to be 5 Gigawatt hours, around half what Lishen Battery is capable of producing.Some experts say that it would make sense for Tesla to work with Lishen Battery, which manufactures the same type of cylindrical battery format (link in Chinese) Tesla is using. The Chinese firm mass produces the batteries at a large scale in a factory in Suzhou, around a 1.5-hour drive from Shanghai, where Tesla’s factory is based.“It’s the right move for Tesla to expand their supplier base so they wouldn’t be held hostage [on pricing] by Panasonic in the future,” said a battery engineer working for a major car battery manufacturer in China.

Title: Tesla denies report on local battery partner for Gigafactory 3
Author: Anonymous
Body: The construction of Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in China is moving in a rapid pace. Not long after the facility’s groundbreaking ceremony, the company’s 864,885-square meter plot of land in Shanghai’s Lingang Industrial Zone has become abuzz with activity. If recent reports are any indication, though, it appears that work is also underway to ensure that the company has all the partners it needs to produce batteries on the upcoming facility.Citing individuals reportedly familiar with the proceedings, Reuters recently published a report suggesting that Tesla has reached a preliminary agreement with China-based battery provider Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for Gigafactory 3. The publication’s sources have noted, though, that Tesla and Tianjin Lishen have reached no official, definitive deal as of date.Among the details reportedly being worked out by Tesla and the battery supplier is the size of Tesla’s battery orders, as well as the specific size of the cells that would be produced in the Shanghai-based factory. Inasmuch as news of a possible battery supplier is compelling though, a Tesla spokesperson has denied that any official agreement between the electric car maker and the Chinese battery provider has been reached.“Tesla previously received quotes from Lishen, but did not proceed further. We have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,” a Tesla spokesperson said.Lishen, for its part, has noted that there is no agreement between itself and Tesla for Gigafactory 3’s batteries, at least for now.The update suggested by Reuters’ sources point to Tesla tapping into the local Chinese market for a possible battery partner. So far, Tesla’s sole battery partner has been Panasonic, which has been producing the 18650 battery cells for the Model S and X in its Japan-based facilities, and the Model 3’s 2170 cells in Gigafactory 1 . Considering the size of the Chinese market, though, Panasonic’s resources would not be enough to meet the demand in the country. Elon Musk described this in a prior tweet.Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 2, 2018While reports of Tesla’s preliminary agreement with Tianjin Lishen are undoubtedly interesting, some aspects of the information provided by Reuters’ sources were a tad bit strange. For one, Elon Musk has stated that the first vehicle set to be produced in Gigafactory 3 is the Model 3, an electric car powered by 2170 cells. Despite Gigafactory 3 only producing the affordable versions of the electric sedan, it doesn’t make much sense for Tianjin Lishen and Tesla to be still undecided about the types of battery cells that would be needed for the upcoming facility. If any, these recent reports of Tesla and it’s possible battery partner in China teases the accelerated pace of Gigafactory 3’s development and construction. The facility, after all, is currently following an incredibly ambitious timeline, with Tesla aiming to finish the initial construction of the factory by the end of summer. Tesla also aims to start producing the Model 3 before the end of 2019.Perhaps the most notable factor in the construction of Gigafactory 3 though, is the apparent favor currently being extended to Tesla by the Chinese government. For one, Tesla was allowed to become the sole owner of Gigafactory 3 — a privilege not given to any other foreign carmaker operating in the country. Apart from this, Tesla was also granted low-interest loans from local Shanghai banks to fund part of the facility’s construction.

Title: Tesla is giving away over 80 new Roadsters for free, which might have killed the referral program - Electrek

Body: January 17 Fred Lambert - Jan. 17th 2019 3:29 pm ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertElon Musk announced that Tesla is killing its referral program due to cost concerns and new information about the latest prizes show that they are going to have to give away over 80 new Roadsters for free.The program might have gotten away from them. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As we previously reported, Tesla’s referral program has changed a lot over the years.It went from a relatively high cost with credit to both referrers and new buyers to a relatively low cost with mainly small prizes taking the form of event invitations and merch.Over the last year, it changed again with the “secret levels” bringing a whole new kind of prizes – especially ‘the new Roadster Founder Series discount secret level’.Tesla started offering discounts on the upcoming new Roadster. After 5 referrals, you unlock the level and get a 2% discount per new referral.At first, it looked like most people unlocking the level would just get a pretty good discount on a significant $250,000 purchase, but Tesla kept the program running for a long time and many people started hitting the threshold for a completely free Roadster.When the automaker added Model 3 to the program, things started to get crazy and many more people reached the threshold.Some even accumulated enough referrals for two free Founder Series Roadsters and Tesla confirmed that it would be giving two Roadsters away to those who get the 105 referrals needed.On top of all the other prizes, it started to add up to a significant value of overall prizes to deliver.At this point, over 60 people are qualified for a Roadster and over 20 of those should get a second one too (via top.teslastats.no):Last month, Ben Sullins tried to delve into the data to look at the value of those referrals.He determined that based on the number of free Roadsters being given away plus a percentage of people taking advantage of the discount, it would have a great impact on Tesla’s margins, especially on the Model 3:Sure enough, Musk confirmed yesterday that he has concerns about how it’s impacting the cost of the Model 3:Yes, ending on Feb 1. It’s adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2019Nonetheless, Tesla is still giving owners and new buyers a few weeks before officially ending the program.That’s insane.While it looks to me like the referral program got away from Tesla a little and they didn’t think so many people would get the full discount, I am not entirely sure it’s the case since Tesla wasn’t in any way obligated to give two Roadsters for free to some people and they willing did it.I am one of those people by the way:Though to be fair, we say “free”, but it’s not entirely the case.While Tesla is going to spend tens of millions to deliver on those Roadsters, they are getting a lot of promotions to help with sales in return.If I use myself as an example, I estimate that I referred for around $15 million in sales for Tesla throughout the program.That said, I agree with Ben here that it still a little too generous from Tesla and unlikely to be sustainable.I also find interesting that all the value of those referrals is being differed to whenever Tesla is actually going to be able to deliver those Roadsters even though the cost is part of the cost of revenue of current sales that Tesla is making right now.I am no financial expert, but I think that’s creating a tricky financial situation.What do you think?

      The Wait for the $35,000 Tesla Could Make for a Tough Year, Bears Say - Barron's

That roughly sums up the takes of two Tesla (TSLA) bears, who wondered Tuesday whether the electric auto maker faces a looming demand crunch because car buyers are waiting for the company to bring out its most-affordable model: the much-ballyhooed $35,000 Model 3 sedan. “There is likely a more limited amount of demand for the higher price point Model 3 vehicles currently being offered—and the pent-up demand for the product may be cleared through (at least in the U.S.),” wrote Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino, who has a Sell rating at a $225 price target, well below FactSet’s average near $341, on the shares. Tesla stock was recently down 1.8% to around $297. Its shares have fallen about 10% in 2019 as the company has undertaken a number of moves meant to cut costs—including price and job cuts—as it faces the sunsetting of valuable federal tax credits. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 30 after the market’s close. Asked for comment, a Tesla spokesman referred Barron’s to the company’s Q4 statement on production and deliveries, released earlier this month. That statement said Q4 Model 3 demand was “limited to mid- and higher-priced variants”; most of the orders came from new customers, rather than those who already had reservations. The Tesla spokesman declined to discuss demand for specific Model 3 variants. In October, Elon Musk said the $35,000 “Standard” model would “probably” be available in less than 6 months; the company’s website currently says 4 to 6. The car, Musk has said, must be makable at a “positive gross margin” before it will be brought to market. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who has an Underperform rating on the stock, on Monday cut his 2019 Model 3 delivery estimates, which were already below the Street’s consensus, a bit further. “We remain concerned about the future level of demand for Model 3 in 2019,” he wrote. Gill expects further price cuts from Tesla in 2019; the aforementioned federal tax credits shrink again in July. “We believe the company is betting on its ability to sell high price Model 3 variants internationally, specifically in Europe, which are expected to commence in February, in order to offset a possible steep decline in U.S. sales,” he wrote. Meanwhile, according to Tamberrino, Tesla’s cost management makes good sense. The company is hoping international demand will drive sales in 2019 as Teslas become more widely available in Europe and China. (The company recently confirmed talks about battery production with a Chinese manufacturer, which could aid cost controls there.)“While we believe the focus on cost take-out is the right move for a highly capital intensive automotive company, we believe the sustainability of demand should be the focus for investors,” Tamberrino wrote. This story was first published on Jan. 22, 2019. It was updated to reflect share price movement and for clarity regarding the statements from the Tesla spokesman.

Title: Tesla (TSLA)'s Big Drop is an Opportunity - Nasdaq.com
Author: Anonymous
Body: Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!Getty imagesOpinions on Elon Musk, the co-founder and face of of Tesla (TSLA) are usually strongly held, but decidedly mixed. Whatever you may think of him though, one thing cannot be denied: He is never afraid to put stuff out there.That has occasionally got him in trouble, but it can also create opportunity for potential investors as bad news gets priced in early. Friday’s huge drop in the stock is a case in point.That drop came as Musk announced a cut of around three thousand to Tesla's workforce. For a company that derives much of its appeal from its current and potential growth, a cut like that is bound to have a negative effect on the stock, and that wasn’t the only bad news. The e-mail that was sent to employees and subsequently made public also warned that Q4 2018 profits would probably be less than in Q3.As you can see, the stock plummeted, losing around $45 or close to thirteen percent on the day.In some ways that is understandable but, as is so often the case with TSLA news, there is another way of looking at it. The profit warning obviously affects the short-term value of the stock, but doesn’t explain a drop of that magnitude, so there was obviously a negative reaction to the cut in the workforce.As I said, the growth profile of Tesla makes a negative reaction to job cuts almost inevitable, but in context it isn’t that big of a deal and can even be looked at as a positive development.The cut works out to be about seven percent of the workforce at the company, which sounds bad until you consider it in the context of thirty percent job growth last year. With that in mind, the cuts look more like an adjustment to last year's overly optimistic view than anything else. That, and the fact that TSLA’s value is all about the future, suggest the stock’s plunge on Friday looks massively overdone.Some may maintain that this is the problem with TSLA, that everything is based on what might be, not what is. If that is truly the case, then Friday’s announced cuts could be seen as good news, not bad. It is a sign of a new spirit of realism at the company and a focus on cost control that many people would say was long overdue. Big institutional investors, who currently hold over sixty percent of the stock, have been calling for cost reductions for some time and if this is seen as a move in that direction, it will ultimately be supportive of TSLA stock.The other thing that suggests that TSLA at around $300 again is a great opportunity is the news over the weekend that the Model 3 has been cleared for deliveries in Europe. Tesla estimates the market for luxury electric sedans to be bigger in Europe than in the U.S., so a strong argument can be made that access to that market is far more important for long-term growth than an adjustment to current staffing levels.The thing is, investing in Tesla is about taking a bet on the future, not just of that company, but also of the auto industry more broadly. We are moving inexorably towards a day when the majority of vehicles are no longer powered by gasoline and it is now clear that electric vehicles (EVs) are going to dominate that move. Tesla is not the only company in that business, as every car manufacturer is now committed to EVs to some extent, but they have a significant head start that should serve them well for quite a while.Without this news, buying TSLA before they release earnings next week would have been a very risky proposition. The spectacular Q3 results moved expectations for Q4 to a point where disappointment was likely and, as we saw on Friday, disappointment can have an outsized effect on the stock.Now though, with that out of the way and expectations adjusting rapidly downward, the downside risk of next week’s earnings is reduced. Add in the good news over the weekend and this looks like a decent entry point for long term investors rather than the beginnings of a collapse.

Title: Tesla’s Job Cuts Bring the Shock of the Ordinary - The Washington Post
Author: Anonymous
Body: Just over a week ago, Elon Musk was tweeting about flying cars. On Friday, he did something much more like a run-of-the-mill car executive: He announced layoffs.Tesla Inc. is cutting 7 percent of its full-time staff. This follows a 9 percent cut in the middle of last year. Remarkably, despite that earlier round of reductions, Musk said in his latest update that headcount expanded 30 percent last year. Having ended 2017 with about 37,500 employees, the CEO tweeted an updated figure of 45,000 last October. So the latest cuts should affect around 3,000 to 3,500 people.What makes this unusual is that Tesla is also supposed to be expanding at a rapid clip. Its pipeline includes a new factory in China (also the subject of much tweeting earlier this month), a pick-up truck, the semi truck, the Model Y and, lest we forget, those solar roofs. Plus, as Musk writes himself:Tesla will need to make these cuts while increasing the Model 3 production rate and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months.When General Motors Co. announced sweeping cuts a couple of months ago, its stock actually jumped. Investors in automotive stocks are a fairly miserable bunch, you see; hardened by decades of wrenching cycles, they judge companies chiefly on how quickly management accepts the essential grimness of their reality. Plus, GM trades at just 6 times forward GAAP earnings. Tesla, however, trades at a somewhat sunnier 133 times earnings. Hence, its stock was down about 7 percent in pre-market trading Friday.This isn’t because of worries about profits. Musk wrote that “preliminary, unaudited results” indicate Tesla made a GAAP profit in the fourth quarter of 2018, but lower than the previous quarter’s 4 percent margin. Consensus forecasts imply a margin of 3 percent anyway.The problem is dissonance. When Tesla reported surprisingly robust third-quarter results in November, it helped for many to draw a line under the “funding secured” debacle. Yet doubts about the sustainability of that performance linger, given Tesla sold a big slug of emissions credits and was selling higher-spec, higher-priced versions of the Model 3. Meanwhile, Tesla’s operating expenses were remarkably flat despite a huge increase in vehicle deliveries. To a Tesla bull, that quarter represented the pivot point, when economies of scale from surging Model 3 production kicked in. Yet, as Friday’s latest announcement shows, that is still a work in progress. For the current quarter, Musk hopes selling higher-end Model 3s in Europe and Asia will, with “some luck,” result in a “tiny profit.” The $35,000 Model 3, first teased almost three years ago, remains an elusive objective, with Musk’s statement suggesting it won’t appear until the second half of this year at the earliest (he wrote that the need for “lower priced variants” would increase as tax incentives, which fell at the start of the January, fall further in July and at the end of the year). Tesla’s recent decision to cut prices across the fleet also undercuts the story of limitless growth.For Tesla to fulfill the staggering growth required to justify its valuation, spending and capex should be increasing. Striving to be more efficient is laudable. The problem for Tesla bulls is that big staff cuts are what ordinary car companies do.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Title: Wasn't Tesla Supposed To Make More Money As The Model 3 Ramped?
Author: Anonymous
Body: Tesla CEO Elon Musk. AP Photo/Noah BergerTesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, sent an email to all the company’s employees early Friday morning which led to the stock falling $45 or 13% to $302 on Friday. It started off weak on Tuesday, dropping $7, but has recovered a bit and is only down $3 for the day. This isn’t the first time the shares have experienced the down elevator syndrome and it may recover, but this time could be different since the Model 3 is shipping in volume and that is what many investors were forecasting would drive the company to sustained profitability.Musk wrote in his email that even though Tesla was selling more Model 3’s in the December quarter it will make less profit than the September quarter. And for the March quarter he wrote, “with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit.” He added that even getting to breakeven will be dependent on selling higher-priced Model 3’s in Europe and Asia which helped the September and December quarters in the U.S., but that is only a temporary situation.It appears that the push to sell Model 3’s before the full Federal tax rebate was cut in half at the end of December was an indication of the issues Musk just wrote about. The need for the push and now the layoffs may have shown the company its backlog is not as robust as it thought it was. Wasn't Tesla Supposed To Make More Money As the Model 3 Ramped?Tesla sold almost 56,000 Model 3’s in the September quarter and increased that to just over 63,000 in the December quarter or a yearly run rate of 252,000 vehicles. This is below the 400,000 to 500,000 per year that is probably still in the plans, but if enough potential buyers have decided to back away from buying one (such as myself which I outlined the reasons for last month) the company may not have the demand that was indicated in the deposits customers made.Tesla Motors unveils the new lower-priced Model 3 sedan. AP Photo/Justin PritchardMusk included in his email that Tesla was cutting 7% of its workforce while at the same time needing to make more cars. He wrote, “Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company.” Note: I added the italics to indicate the seriousness of this comment. However, unless Tesla’s stock falls substantially, 50% or more, the company should be able to sell more stock to get it through this very rough going.A key bull thesis may be broken One of the key bull arguments is Tesla growing revenue at substantial rates , which is needed to overcome the stock’s high valuation. Unfortunately, with Musk’s email analysts are cutting their revenue and earnings estimates, and even uber-Tesla bull Trip Chowdhry at Global Equity Research is now expecting flattish 2019 revenue.Tesla should generate about $21 billion in revenue for 2018, and Chowdhry had been forecasting 2019 revenue of $29 billion for a 41% growth rate. He had also been estimating operating profit of $204 million in 2018, increasing to $1.9 billion in 2019 or $6.87 in earnings per share. These projections will have to come down and probably substantially.Jeffrey Osborne at Cowen has an Underperform rating on Tesla with a $200 price target (it had been $250) and he dropped his 2019 EPS estimate from $11.02 to $6.16 and 2020 from $11.16 to $8.88. He is still expecting the company to increase revenue by 15% in 2019 to $24.4 billion but only by 4% in 2020 to $25.4 billion.Second bull thesis on capital could also take a hitMusk has touted that Tesla will be able to generate enough free cash flow to fund its capital requirements and won’t need to sell more stock or increase debt. This will be put to the test as the table from Cowen’s Osborne details the potential for $20 to $25 billion needed from 2017 to 2022. With $10.9 billion in debt as of September last year, $3 billion in cash, $920 million in debt coming due in March and the ability to generate substantial free cash flow being much more in doubt, the company may have to sell more stock.Tesla capital requirementsChart shows support around $295 and then $250It won’t be until Wednesday, January 30, that any more details are provided so the stock may be in a holding pattern until then, probably with a bit of downside risk due to the negative news and information vacuum until then. There is some short-term support around $295 with the next major support level at $250.Tesla 3 year price chartIf it starts to look like the company can’t ramp the Model 3 with enough profitability and more capital needed to be raised, investors will have to believe that future products (full self-driving, Model Y, Semi, Truck and Roadster on the vehicle side and Powerwall/pack and Solar Roof on the energy side) can not just make up the revenue slack but do it profitability. Since it doesn’t look like Tesla can do this with a quarter of a million Model 3’s being sold in a year, uncertainty could enter investors minds. And we all know investors hate uncertainty .I provide independent research of technology companies and was previously one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for Atlantic Trust (Invesco's high...I provide independent research of technology companies and was previously one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for Atlantic Trust (Invesco's high

Title: Tesla Model 3 receives European homologation as first batch is on its way - Electrek

Body: January 21 Fred Lambert - Jan. 21st 2019 9:06 am ET @FredericLambert @FredericLambertTesla has now received European homologation for Model 3 – enabling the automaker to deliver the new electric car in European markets as the first batch of vehicles is on its way. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); RDW, the Dutch regulator and European authority used by Tesla to approve its vehicles for European roads, has confirmed that Model 3 is now homologated for Europe.The timing couldn’t be better because thousands of Model 3 vehicles are currently on a ship to Europe.As we reported just over a week ago, a massive Tesla Model 3 shipment was spotted being gathered at the San Francisco port before being loaded inside a cargo ship.Many Tesla Model 3 reservation holders in Europe have been waiting for the vehicle for years and they are understandably excited.They have been tracking the vessel that is bringing their vehicles and it was spotted about to enter the Panama canal yesterday.The cargo ship is expected to arrive at the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium within the next 2 weeks – late on February 2 to be precise.As we previously reported, the port company that handles vehicle unloading in Zeebrugge plans to handle 3,000 Model 3’s per week coming to Europe starting next month.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is even considering letting buyers pick up their cars directly at the port:Thanks, good idea!— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 18, 2019Though it’s unclear if the company could actually do that since it could be a concern with the port authority.As we previously reported, Tesla received almost 14,000 Model 3 orders in Europe as of earlier this month. That’s only from reservation holders and the number is expected to grow since Tesla has now opened Model 3 orders to the public in Europe and China.In those markets, Tesla is currently only taking orders for the Model 3 Performance version and Dual Motor AWD version, which happen to be the most expensive versions of the vehicle.Subscribe to Electrek on YouTube for exclusive videos and subscribe to the podcast.
